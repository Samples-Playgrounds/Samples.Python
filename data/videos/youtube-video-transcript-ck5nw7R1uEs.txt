3 million that is the number of rums
Google receives every year and of those
applicants they only hire around
0.2% in this video I'm going to show you
how to write a resume that's going to
grab any recruiters attention regardless
of your professional background this is
a Formula that I use to help my clients
go from constant rejection to Landing
interviews with their dream companies
I've spent the last decade working
full-time as a technical recruiter and
Technical recruiting leader for
companies like Google Lyft Uber Tik Tok
and the New York Times I reviewed
hundreds of thousands of resumés hired
hundreds of people and helped many job
Seekers succeed so for example my client
Cameron was really unhappy in his job
didn't even want to go to work wasn't
able to get any traction when he would
apply to jobs didn't know what to do and
after working with me we were able to
get him 10 job interviews and he got a
job offer in 2 weeks then you have my
other client Ravi who was really stuck
in his dead end job and really had some
long-term goals that he wanted to to get
to so after working with me we were able
to get him his next job with a
$100,000 pay increase and he and his
wife were able to pay off their student
loan debt so in this video I'm going to
break down the formula that I use on my
clients to help them revamp their
resumes and of course stay until the end
cuz then I'm going to give you the good
stuff the secret SAU keep watching
section one preparation before you start
writing your resume it is really
important that you do your research and
study the market the the reason why is
because if you don't do that you're
going to fall into this trap that most
people fall into which is creating a
generic resume in today's job market it
is more important than ever to create a
resume that is tailored to the job
family or job vertical that you're
wanting to apply for when you have a
generic resume it really makes it
difficult for recruiters to really
understand who you are and the value
that you actually bring to the job and
the company that you're applying to so
in this first step when you study the
Market you're going to make a list first
you're going to make a list of the
companies that you want to work for then
you're going to make a list of the jobs
that you want to apply for then you're
going to head over to those companies
pages and you're going to look at
LinkedIn and go scrape those job boards
and see what jobs are posted when you go
to LinkedIn and you look for jobs you
may actually find companies that you
weren't really interested in the past or
you hadn't thought of but they have a
job opening that's really enticing when
you do this research what you're going
to notice are patterns you're going to
find these through points between each
of these roles now once you find those
through points then you're going to be
able to craft a resume that's going to
be tailored to those jobs that you want
to apply for that way when you do write
your resume and you need to tailor it
more specifically to the jobs that
you're applying for it's only going to
take a couple of minutes now once you've
completed this step then we can go to
the next step which is to build your
resume section two Market your personal
brand your resume is a document that
markets you to potential employers based
on your past experience and and
achievements it needs to reflect who you
are as a business professional so let's
talk about the summary section on the
rese now I'll be really honest as a
recruiter I don't really read summaries
I go straight down to the experience
section to determine if your experience
aligns to the job that you're applying
for however if you're in a situation
that requires a little bit of extra
explanation so for example if you were
laid off from your last job you can
actually mention that in the summary if
you want to relocate you can mention
that in the summary you can say open to
relocation if you are making a career
transition this summary will allow you
the opportunity to explain how your
skill set aligns to this job that you're
applying for so here are the steps to
crafting your professional summary who
you are professionally begin with a
clear statement of your professional
capacities for example you can say
experienced marketing manager with a
proven track record in digital marketing
and brand management value proposition
and evidence so you're going to follow
this with a value proposition that
includes evidence so mention specific
achievements like successfully let a
campaign that boosted social media
engagement by 40% you're going to
provide evidence early on to
substantiate your claims and make your
summary much more credible supporting
trade or memorable item add a trade or
memorable item that makes you stand out
like an award or a unique project for
example you can say recipient of the
2022 marketing Excellence award for
Innovative campaign strategies again
avoid generic language like results
driven professional or good communicator
all of that makes your summary sound
super boring and then career goals
clearly State why you're applying for
the position so for example you can say
aiming to apply my expertise in digital
marketing to help a dynamic company
Drive Innovation and achieve its growth
objectives again identify what's going
to make you stand out and make you
unique and separate yourself from all of
the other applicants this could be
specific skills or experiences or
accomplishments section three
achievements highlighting hiring teams
want to know what you've accomplished
and what business value you're going to
bring to that business and the job
you're applying for think about Sarah a
sales manager initially her resume list
of responsibilities like manage sales
team and develop sales strategies while
these points were true they didn't
effectively showcase her business impact
now after focusing on her achievements
her bullet points read like this
increased Regional sales by 25% in one
year by implementing new training
programs and sales strategies also use
numbers whenever possible use
percentages or dollar amounts talk about
what you increased or decreased so for
example you can say increase sales by
20% over a 6-month period which is much
more impactful than just saying increase
sales now when you're going to describe
your achievements you can use a claim
evidence approach so what you're going
to do is you're going to start with a
claim so for example you can say for
your claim exceeded annual sales quotas
then here's the evidence you can write
achieve $22 million against a goal of 20
million in 2020 $25 million against a
goal of $23 million in 2021 and on track
to hit $32 million against a goal of $30
million in 2022 again what you want to
do is you want to highlight the impact
in the results of your work companies
want to know did you save the company
money did you increase profits were you
able to increase productivity what were
the results of the work that you've done
section four skill section this is where
a lot of people really mess up because
what they end up doing is they end up
writing a lot of generic terms like good
communicator now you don't need to list
every single skill that you have instead
list the skills that you have that are
relevant to the position that you're
applying to so for example if you use
specific tools let's say Google
analytics or Salesforce CRM make sure
you list those as well now depending on
the job you're applying for when you're
reading that job description see if they
make mention of your proficiency level
in those tools so for example let's say
you're applying for a role as a senior
business data analyst and Excel is
something that you need to have for your
job what you can write in your skills
section is advanced in Excel section
five professional experience now this is
my favorite part of a resume because
this is where you get to really showcase
and highlight who you are and the impact
that you've had on a business business
what you want to do is in your
experience section you want to write out
bullet points because it's a lot easier
for the person reading your resume to be
able to read it an easy way to write
your results on your resume is to use
the Google XYZ formula the Google XYZ
formula States accomplished X as
measured by y by doing Z and here's an
example you can say increased Regional
sales by 25% by implementing a new
training program and sales strategies
resulting in a $1.2 million Revenue
increase and again what you want to do
is when you've done your research and
you've read the job description align
what you've read in the job description
to what it is that they're looking for
in the experience that you've had and so
that way you can craft your Google XYZ
formulas to align with the jobs and your
experience so here's a before and after
transformation so you can see another
example so before responsible for
overseeing marketing campaigns after
directed a marketing campaign that
increased website traffic by 30% within
3 months by implementing targeted SEO
strategies section six education
education is where you're going to list
any education that you have outside of
any type of certifications when you list
out your education you want to name the
institution that you went to the degree
that you received and any relevant
coursework that you took that is
relevant to the job that you're applying
for also if you are a newer graduate
meaning you've graduated in the past 3
years what you want to do is you want to
include your graduation dates and on
your resume move move your education to
the very top of the resume underneath
your contact information the reason why
is because that will easily indicate to
the recruiter that you're a newer
graduate if you're beyond 3 years then
what you do is move your education
section to after your experience section
and remove your dates of graduation
here's an example of how you can write
your education on your resume University
of California Berkeley Bachelor of Arts
and marketing graduated 2022 honors
Magnum Kare relevant coursework digital
marketing consumer Behavior market
research now if you do have any
certifications you can either create a
new section titled certifications and
you can include it there or if you want
to put it into your education section
let's say cuz do formatting wise you
want to make sure it fits then at the
top of the section just say education
and certifications then you're going to
list out all of your certifications and
if any of those certifications have any
type of IDs go ahead and leave those
there and if there're any external links
to those certifications so that the
recruiter can click on it then include
those as well section seven final
touches formatting again another
favorite I feel like every section is my
favorite but no but really it's my
favorite now the key to formatting is
you want it to be simple and easy to
read and make sure it's easily scannable
now I know that there are websites like
canva and on Etsy where you can get
resumé templates even though canva
offers ré templates I do not not
recommend them yes they are beautiful
and by the way I subscribe to canva I
think it's an awesome tool I use it for
so many things but when it comes to
resumé templates I do not recommend it
here's why most of the time when you are
downloading these resumé templates a lot
of them have clip art and bar graphs and
place for your head shot and it really
detracts and takes away from your resume
so I know that people look at RS as a
marketing document but it's not really a
marketing document in that way give me
an example I'll see a resume and it'll
say like in a skill section it'll say
Excel then it'll have some dots next to
it and I'm like what do those dots mean
I have no idea it's like an interpretive
dance I don't know what it means you
don't want to confuse the recruiter or
the hiring manager so it's better to
just be clear keep it super simple so
here are some tips to write a simple and
cleanly designed resume we're going to
start with fonts my favorite fonts to
use are Ariel and calbri I use cbri more
than aiel both of them are great I've
seen Times New Roman actually making a
comeback and it's Chic I dig it
consistent layout you need to make sure
that you have your headings fonts and
spacing are consistent throughout the
resume it's going to make it look more
polished and more presentable bullet
points when you are using bullet points
to period or not to period that is the
question it's more of a taste thing some
people say no periods some people say
yes periods it doesn't really matter if
you use periods or not what does matter
is you're doing it consistently
throughout the resume now bold for
emphasis sprinkle a little bold around
here and there to emphasize things like
where you've worked the dates that
you've worked Etc consistent contact
information so up at the very top of
your resume you want to make sure that
you're very clear about who you are so
you're going to have your name your
location your phone pH number your email
address your LinkedIn link and any other
relevant link so for example if you're a
designer if you're in creative and you
have outside portfolios include those
Links at the very top of your resume and
of course spell check proofread true
story when I worked at Google one of my
hiring managers rejected a candidate and
I didn't catch it but the resume had a
spelling mistake and the hiring manager
literally said this person does not pay
attention to detail I will not be
considering them take it from me take it
from that experience better to spell
check save as a PDF save your resume as
a PDF when you save your file as a PDF
and you are applying to jobs it will
maintain the Integrity of the resume so
it's going to look the same on your
screen as it is going to look the same
on the other person's screen now the
most important part here are things to
avoid so you want to avoid images
Graphics any type of clip art columns
and tables now the the reason why you
want to remove columns and tables is
that there are some applicant tracking
systems that cannot read those so for
example work day cannot read a resume
that is more than a single column so if
you have a two column resume it's not
going to be able to catch all that data
and extract that text section eight
tailoring you don't have to rewrite your
resume every time you apply to a job
what we just did is we've created a
resume for you that's very targeted to
the type of jobs you want to apply for
and the type of jobs you want to apply
for really have to be in a singular
vertical or a singular job family then
what you do is when you did that
research like you did at the very
beginning before you wrote your resume
now you're going to go to those job
postings now you're going to look at
those and you are going to put the job
posting next to your resume and you're
going to look at them side by side and
you are going to see what parts of your
resume are the same as the job
description and what things are
different and of those things that are
different you're going to include clude
those into your resume and make sure
that it is very crystal clear on your
resume that you are a fit for that
position now a common misconception that
I need to talk about are applicant
tracking systems applicant tracking
systems are also known as ATS systems
companies will license an applicant
tracking system and what this is It's a
digital filing cabinet and it's built on
really old Legacy technology that's 20
years old so when you are applying to a
role what what the recruiter has done is
they've gone into the applicant tracking
system and through the system they're
able to post the job on their careers
page and several external job boards
let's say LinkedIn or indeed now the
mistake that a lot of people make is
they'll say I need to find all the
keywords in a job description and I just
need to throw them in my resume and we
call that keyword stuffing that does not
work because people think I need to beat
an ATS listen the ATS is a digital
filing cabinet there ain't nothing to
beat you mind want to try to kick it
down the road but I ain't going to work
so the reality is this when you apply to
a position we use First in first out
logic so when you apply to a job if you
are the first one to apply your resume
will show up first now when you apply to
a job on the technical side of things
here's what happens when you apply to a
job you apply to a job you basically get
a profile that's created in the
applicant tracking system for you and
it'll show the jobs that you've applied
for so when I is a recruit go to pull up
your application it's going to show me
your resume and any other input that you
manually inputed the questions about
like your racial identity thing your
veteran status disability status that is
actually not something that recruiters
can see that is information that goes
directly to the Department of Labor
those just don't show up there are a lot
of career coaches people who have never
actually worked in recruiting who will
say things like throw as many keywords
into your resume as possible so that way
you can beat the ATS or the worst one
I've ever seen is they'll say take the
job description copy it paste it into
your resume and put it in white font so
that way the comp the the Bots can read
it the AI can read it like no that just
makes your resume look silly like even
if you put it in point4 font that just
doesn't work come on that is not what is
happening instead of stuffing your
resume with keywords what you want to do
is you do want to recognize what those
keywords are but you want to Pepper them
throughout your resume
thoughtfully for the human reader
because it's a human that's actually
going to read and scan your resume true
story I once had a resume that was
submitted for a marketing director it
was over 20 pages long two Z the resume
had all these keywords stuffed in the
border on the right hand side it was
that was the weirdest resume I've ever
seen in my life let's just not do that
here's the secret to avoid the biggest
mistake the truth is that as I was in
the process of editing my video I
realized that the secret that I gave you
wasn't actually the best secret so
here's the best secret what I want you
to do is picture this let's look at this
analogy imagine you made dinner
reservations at a restaurant and you go
to the restaurant and you sit down and
when you sit down the waiter gives you a
menu and the menu says stainless steel
utensils Teakwood Furniture porcelain
plates you'd be confused right and
you're confused because you think yeah
of course you have these are basic
expectations because you're at a
restaurant it's not like they're going
to go make food and put the food in your
hand they're going to serve it to you on
a plate and give you utensils to eat the
food with and you see this a lot with
resumés where people will write things
like pays attention to detail excellent
Communicator works well in teams
remember these are just basic
expectations when you work in a job it's
not something that you need to put on
your resume what we want to do is you
want to think of the job description as
the menu that you're receiving so when
you get that menu what dish do you want
to order so study the menu carefully and
understand what that position calls for
then describe how your background is
that succulent delicious dish that
they've been craving so don't sell the
plate and the silverware sell the sizzle
I just realize I didn't have my camera
on what
