We rarely expect our careers to change
in a single conversation. But if you've
ever been laid off, you know how quickly
everything can shift. One meeting, 15
minutes, and suddenly it feels like
years of your hard work just disappear.
And right now, layoffs are not rare.
They're structural. Hiring timelines
have doubled across many industries.
[music] Senior roles are moving slower
than ever and the average job search for
mid to senior professionals is now 3 to
n months even in strong job markets.
This is the landscape you've suddenly
been dropped into. For high performers,
your mind doesn't go to hope. It goes
straight to the worst case scenario.
[music] You think, "What if I'm out of
work for months? What if my savings run
out? What if I have to take a job that I
don't want to pay the bills?" And while
that fear feels personal, it's also part
of a much larger reality. Hiring
timelines have stretched. Competition
has intensified. And in markets like
this, simply trying to wing it after a
layoff can turn a temporary setback into
your long-term problem. Because what
derails most candidates isn't the
layoff. It's the reaction that follows.
Shock creates urgency. Urgency creates
panic. and panic [music]
leads to decisions you'd never make with
a clear mind. If you're new here, hi,
I'm Farah. I've spent more than a decade
hiring and leading technical recruiting
teams at Google, Lyft, Uber, and Tik
Tok. I've also lived through four
layoffs myself. And what I've seen from
both sides of the table is that the
difference between finding a job in six
weeks and searching for six months isn't
luck. It's the strategy you execute in
the first 10 days. So, in this video,
I'm going to walk you through a simple
three-phase 10-day plan that stabilizes
your finances, resets your narrative,
and rebuilds your momentum, even if
you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's start
where most people go wrong, because I
made this [music] mistake, too. My first
layoff hit me like a ton of bricks. This
was before I became a recruiter. I
remember the walk home. I was crying
with a mix of disbelief, [music]
embarrassment, and fear swirling all
together. I shut down and stayed in bed
for over a week. And once I got out of
bed, I frantically applied to jobs till
2 in the morning, hoping that more
effort and more applications would
somehow equal more control. But it
didn't. What I didn't understand then
was this. A layoff is an emotional
event. A job search is a strategic
process. And when you mix the two
without a system, you're going to lose
your leverage. The truth is, I wasted
weeks and ended up in a job that I
didn't want, earning less than I should
have because I let my fear run the show.
Many years later, when I faced my fourth
layoff, the situation was the same, but
my response wasn't. This time, I asked
about severance timelines. I negotiated.
I filed for unemployment immediately. I
compared health insurance options. I
treated the situation like what it was,
a business problem, not my personal
failure. Nothing about me had changed
except my approach. I stopped operating
like a shocked employee and I started
operating like the CEO of my career.
[music] That shift didn't remove the
fear, but it gave me control. And that
control made all the difference. So,
let's get started. Phase one, days 0
through two, financial triage. One of
the hardest truths to accept is that job
searches take time. [music] Three to
nine months is standard now even for top
performers. This isn't about your
talent. It's about market velocity.
Which means your immediate challenge
isn't finding the next job. It's
extending your runway. Because runway
determines how strategic you can afford
to be. Runway is the following formula.
Cash on hand plus incoming cash divided
by monthly expenses. It tells you how
long you can sustain yourself without
panicking. And panic more than anything
is what derails good candidates. In the
first 48 hours, your goal is to
stabilize, not optimize. Number one, get
written proof. Ask HR for an email
confirming your layoff was due to
restructuring, not your performance.
It's a small detail that prevents huge
doubt later when you're applying to
jobs. Because hiring managers read
between the [music] lines, it's your job
to help clarify the lines for them.
Number two, file for unemployment
immediately. The timeline starts the day
you're terminated. [music]
Every day you wait is a day of benefits
lost. This single step has saved some of
my clients thousands of dollars. Number
three, review and negotiate your
severance. Shock makes people passive,
but most severance packages have room to
discuss timing or health benefits. If
you can speak with an attorney, even for
an hour, a small negotiation here can
extend your runway by weeks. Number
four, compare health care options. Cobra
isn't your only choice. Marketplace
plans can be far more affordable,
especially if your income has dropped to
zero. Most people overpay simply because
they panic. Number five, cut
non-essentials quickly. Every dollar you
keep now extends the time that you have
to make thoughtful decisions. [music]
This is not about your deprivation. It's
about buying back your clarity. By the
end of day two, your financial
foundation should feel steadier. Not
perfect, but stable enough for you to
breathe. Phase two, days three through
five, define your narrative. Once the
financial dust settles, the next
challenge is less visible, but equally
important, and that is your story. When
a hiring manager hears layoff, they
often fill in the blanks themselves. And
those assumptions rarely work out in
your favor unless you define your
narrative first. And that's where your
brag document comes in. Think of it as a
raw material for your resume, LinkedIn,
and interview strategy. Number one,
write down your wins. Every project,
every metric, every piece of feedback,
gather it while it's still fresh in your
mind [music] because memory fades
fastest under stress. So, document while
you're clear. Number two, select three
to four quantifiable stories.
Specificity builds trust. If you say, "I
own the road map," that's vague. But if
you say, "I let a team that launched X
feature resulting in Y outcome." That
has more credibility. Just get it all on
paper before you forget. [music] Number
three, craft a clean, neutral layoff
line. You only need one to two
sentences. Keep it factual, calm, and
forwardlooking. Something like this. My
role was eliminated as part of a
companywide restructuring. I'm now
exploring opportunities where I can
apply what I built. This isn't about
defending yourself. [music] It's about
giving hiring managers a narrative they
can confidently support. A clear
narrative reduces risk, and risk is what
slows hiring. Phase three, days 5
through 10, reactivate your network.
Now, this is the phase most people dread
and where most people unintentionally
stall their search. Because when you're
anxious, it feels safer to apply online
because applying online feels active. It
feels productive. But online
applications rarely move senior
candidates forward. Not because you're
not qualified, but because hiring at
this level happens through trust, not
volume. Warm networks are a better
approach. Not the only approach, but an
essential one. Not because of
favoritism, but because trust
accelerates hiring. So over these five
days, your focus needs to shift to
reconnecting with people intentionally.
Number one, start with warm
relationships. Former managers,
colleagues, mentors, people who know the
quality of your work. These are people
most likely to respond during uncertain
markets. Number two, use low pressure
messages. You're not asking for a job,
you're asking for perspective. So, say
something like this. I was impacted by
recent layoffs. I'm exploring next steps
and would value your perspective on the
market for your insert their role. Are
you free for a short call next week?
It's simple, professional, and
non-demanding. Number three, track your
outreach. Because when fear spikes, it's
easy to believe that nothing is working
and nothing is moving. So, a simple
spreadsheet really brings your reality
back into focus. Motion becomes visible
when you measure it. 10 thoughtful
conversations will move your search
further than 100 cold applications.

Now, let's talk about ongoing work,
which are your system and your nervous
system. A job search at this level is as
much emotional as it is strategic.
Senior searches take time. 3 to [music]
9 months is not unusual. That doesn't
mean something is wrong with you. It
means the process is slow. So, create a
daily plan that you can sustain. Here's
an example. Find two to three target
companies that you want to work for and
look up their mission and jobs pages.
One to two personalized outreach
messages. A small LinkedIn or resume
update. One practiced interview answer.
Then lather, rinse, and repeat. [music]
And remember to take care of your
basics. Sleep, movement, routine. Your
health and your wealth are the two most
important things in your life. When your
energy drops, desperation shows up in
your communication. People can feel it
even through email. A sustainable system
is what carries you on the days when
clarity is hard to access. A layoff can
be really destabilizing in your life,
but it doesn't have to define the next
chapter of your career. [music] Your
next step is simple. Identify which
phase you're in right now and then start
there. If it's the first 48 hours, focus
on financial triage. If that's done,
build your wins documents. If your
narrative is clear, then send three
outreach messages today. I mean, right
now. Like, why aren't you doing it? Go.
