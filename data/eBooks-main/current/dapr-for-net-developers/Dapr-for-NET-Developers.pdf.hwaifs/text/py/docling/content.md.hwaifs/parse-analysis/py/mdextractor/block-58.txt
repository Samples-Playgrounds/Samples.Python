ASP.NET Core injects an instance of the service proxy using constructor injection: :::{custom-style=CodeBox} csharp  public CollectionController(      ILogger<CollectionController> logger,      IFineCalculator fineCalculator,      VehicleRegistrationService vehicleRegistrationService, DaprClient daprClient)  {      // ...  } ::: The VehicleRegistrationService class contains a single method: GetVehicleInfo . It uses the ASP.NET Core HttpClient to call the VehicleRegistration service: _httpClient; public VehicleRegistrationService(HttpClient httpClient) { _httpClient = httpClient; }
