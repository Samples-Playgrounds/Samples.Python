The updated code implements the following steps:

- First a new [`DaprClient`]{custom-style=Code} instance is instantiated. This class
enables you to interact with the Dapr sidecar.
- From the state store, [`DaprClient.GetStateAsync`]{custom-style=Code} fetches the
value for the [`counter`]{custom-style=Code} key. If the key doesn't exist, the
default value for [`int`]{custom-style=Code} (which is [`0`]{custom-style=Code}) is
returned.
- The code then iterates, writing the [`counter`]{custom-style=Code} value to the
console and saving an incremented value to the state store.
