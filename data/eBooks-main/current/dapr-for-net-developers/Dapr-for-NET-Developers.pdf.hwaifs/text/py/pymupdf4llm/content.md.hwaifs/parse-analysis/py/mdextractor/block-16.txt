Running locally with Docker Compose and Visual Studio, you can set breakpoints and
debug into the application. For production scenarios, it's recommended to host your
application in Kubernetes. This book includes an accompanying reference application,
[eShopOnDapr](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnDapr), that contains
scripts to deploy to Kubernetes.

To learn more about the Dapr service invocation building block used in this
walkthrough, refer to [chapter 6](#the-dapr-service-invocation-building-blo).
