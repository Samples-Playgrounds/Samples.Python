Install-Package Dapr.AspNetCore

The [`AddDaprClient`]{custom-style=Code} call registers the [`DaprClient`]{customstyle=Code} class with the ASP.NET Core dependency injection system. With the client
registered, you can now inject an instance of [`DaprClient`]{custom-style=Code} into
your service code to communicate with the Dapr sidecar, building blocks, and
components.
