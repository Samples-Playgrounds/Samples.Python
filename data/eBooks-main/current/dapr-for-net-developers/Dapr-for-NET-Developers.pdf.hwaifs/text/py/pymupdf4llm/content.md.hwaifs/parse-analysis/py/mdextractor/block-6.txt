Core API project includes middleware to redirect client requests to the HTTPS
endpoint. This breaks communication between the Dapr sidecar and your application,
unless you explicitly configure the use of HTTPS when running your Dapr application.
To enable the Dapr sidecar to communicate over HTTPS, include the [`--appssl`]{custom-style=Code} flag in the Dapr command to start the application. Also
specify the HTTPS port using the [`--app-port`]{custom-style=Code} parameter. The
remainder of this walkthrough uses plain HTTP communication between the sidecar and
the application, and requires you to clear the **Configure for HTTPS** checkbox.
