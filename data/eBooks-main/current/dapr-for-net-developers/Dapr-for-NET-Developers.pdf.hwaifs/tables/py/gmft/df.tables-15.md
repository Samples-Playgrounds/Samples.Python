|  3 | The | sidecar manages how, when and where each actor runs, and also routes messages between                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  6 | The | sidecar API is only one part of the equation. The service itself also needs to implement an API specification, because the actual code that you write for the actor will run inside the service itself. Figure 11-1 shows the various API calls between the service and its sidecar: |
