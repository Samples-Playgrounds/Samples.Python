|  3 |    | When running in self-hosted mode, the health API isn’t automatically invoked. You can invoke the API though from application code or a health monitoring tool.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  4 |    | When running in Kubernetes, the Dapr sidecar-injector automatically configures Kubernetes to use the health API for executing liveness probes and readiness probes.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  5 |    | Kubernetes uses liveness probes to determine whether a container is up and running. If a liveness probe returns a failure code, Kubernetes will assume the container is dead and automatically restart it. This feature increases the overall availability of your application.                                                                           |
|  6 | A  | Kubernetes uses readiness probes to determine whether a container is ready to start accepting traffic. pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready. Readiness determines whether a Kubernetes service can direct traffic to a pod in a load-balancing scenario. Pods that aren’t ready are automatically removed from the load-balancer. |
|  7 |    | Liveness and readiness probes have several configurable parameters. Both are configured in the container spec section of a pod’s manifest file. By default, Dapr uses the following configuration for each sidecar container:                                                                                                                             |
