      <td>applications choose availability over consistency. Dapr supports this choice with its eventual consistency strategy. Consider an underlying data store, such as Azure CosmosDB, which stores redundant data on multiple replicas. With eventual consistency, the state store writes the update to one replica and completes the write request with the client. After this time, the store will asynchronously update its replicas. Read requests can return data from any of the replicas, including those replicas that haven’t yet received the latest update.</td>

      <td>applications choose consistency over availability. Dapr supports this choice with its strong consistency strategy. In this scenario, the state store will synchronously update all (or, in some cases, quorum of) required replicas before completing the write request. Read operations will return the most up-to-date data consistently across replicas.</td>
