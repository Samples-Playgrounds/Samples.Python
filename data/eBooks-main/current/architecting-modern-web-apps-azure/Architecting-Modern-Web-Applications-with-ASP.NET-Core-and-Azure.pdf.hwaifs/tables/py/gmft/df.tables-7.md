|  0 | Once a given request has been matched to a route, but before the action method is called, Core MVC will perform model binding and model validation on the request. Model binding is responsible for converting incoming HTTP data into the .NET types specified as parameters of action method to be called. For example, if the action method expects an int id parameter, binding will attempt to provide this parameter from a value provided as part of the request. model binding looks for values in a posted form, values in the route itself, and query string Assuming an id value is found, it will be converted to an integer before being passed into the method. | ASP.NET the model To do so, values. action          |
|  1 | After binding the model but before calling the action method, model validation occurs. Model validation uses optional attributes on the model type, and can help ensure that the provided object conforms to certain data requirements. Certain values may be specified as required, or to a certain length or numeric range, etc. If validation attributes are specified but the model conform to their requirements, the property ModelState.IsValid will be false, and the set of validation rules will be available to send to the client making the request.                                                                                                             | model limited does not failing                      |
|  2 | If you’re using model validation, you should be sure to always check that the model is valid performing any state-altering commands, to ensure your app is not corrupted by invalid data. use a filter to avoid the need to add code for this validation in every action. ASP.NET Core offer a way of intercepting groups of requests, so that common policies and cross-cutting can be applied on a targeted basis. Filters can be applied to individual actions, whole globally for an application.                                                                                                                                                                         | before You can MVC filters concerns controllers, or |
|  3 | For web APIs, ASP.NET Core MVC supports content negotiation, allowing requests to specify responses should be formatted. Based on headers provided in the request, actions returning format the response in XML, JSON, or another supported format. This feature enables the be used by multiple clients with different data format requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | how data will same API to                           |
