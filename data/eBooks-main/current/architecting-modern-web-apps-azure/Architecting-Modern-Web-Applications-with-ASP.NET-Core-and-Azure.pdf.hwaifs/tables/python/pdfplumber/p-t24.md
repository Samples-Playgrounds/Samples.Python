|  1 | Avoid binding together behavior that is only coincidentally repetitive. For example, just because two   |
|  2 | different constants both have the same value, that doesn’t mean you should have only one constant, if   |
|  3 | conceptually they’re referring to different things. Duplication is always preferable to coupling to the |
|  4 | wrong abstraction.                                                                                      |
