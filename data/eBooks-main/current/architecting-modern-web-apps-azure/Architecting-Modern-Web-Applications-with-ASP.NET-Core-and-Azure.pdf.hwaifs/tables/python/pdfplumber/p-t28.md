|  1 | Layers represent logical separation within the application. In the event that application logic is      |
|  2 | physically distributed to separate servers or processes, these separate physical deployment targets are |
|  3 | referred to as tiers. It’s possible, and quite common, to have an N-Layer application that is deployed  |
|  4 | to a single tier.                                                                                       |
