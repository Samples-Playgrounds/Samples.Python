It was our first\ntrip out of the country, and aside from the ridiculously long flight—eight hours on an airplane feels\nlike forever to somebody who hasn’t yet finished their first decade of life—I really had no idea of\nwhat to expect. In fact, in an amusing anecdote my father has yet', ' to tire of telling, I remember having\nto sit down with my parents in front of a globe so that they could explain to me that “the United\nStates” was not, in fact, synonymous with “the world.”\n\nIt was entirely a trip of firsts: my first experience wandering around in a world where I couldn’t\nunderstand any of the written signs, my first experience eating food I couldn’t recognize, and my\nfirst experience feeling completely lost in the world around', ' me. I found, to my eight-year-old horror,\nthat I couldn’t even figure out which bathroom to use—which, considering I had just the year before\nmanaged to convince my mother I didn’t need to be escorted to the bathroom and back, was of\nparticular concern. I didn’t want her to start thinking I actually needed adult supervision. This was\nclearly not my home, and I was more than a little terrified of it.\n\nVisiting a foreign land, particularly to some', 'one who has cocooned themselves entirely in the\nconcepts and cultures of “home,” can be intimidating and overwhelming without a guide. On that trip\nto France I had my parents, and despite neither of them speaking anything close to fluent French,\nthey managed to guide us through the tricky parts. (French-English guidebooks are a wonderful\nthing.)\n\nFor the typical Java developer, finding a guide to exploring the .NET ecosystem can be tricky, since\n', 'the average Java developer can still hearken back to a time when expressing an interest in looking at\n.NET was tantamount to declaring a desire to betray everything good and right in the world (or so it\nseemed, at least at the time).\n\nIn this paper, I will serve as your guide to the .NET world. I’ve been a part of the .NET ecosystem\nalmost as long as I’ve been a part of Java’s. I started with Java in 1996; I started with what would\nbecome .NET in', ' 2000, even before it was announced. I’ve built applications in both, written books\nfor both, and explored the source for both. They’re closer to one another than you might think, but\neach has been fundamentally influenced by the people using them. In fact, it’s not a bad analogy to\nthink of them as twin brothers, separated at birth, raised by different sets of parents. Same DNA, but\nshaped by their experiences and events to be different in a num', 'ber of interesting places.\n\nIf you’re a Java developer, looking to get started exploring the .NET ecosystem, then suspend what\nyou think you know, take my hand, and let’s take a trip to a foreign land. Doing so will require a little\nhistory to understand how things came to be, then a quick set of instructions on how to get the\ntooling set up (and which tooling you want, depending on your preferences). Once the environment\nis set up, we can pick u', 'p the critical differences between C# and Java, and start diving into some\nof the central frameworks in this world—ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and a few others. When we\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n 1\n\n\x0cfinish up, if you’re following along, you’ll have everything you need to start your own exploration of\nthe .NET community, and from there you’ll get to draw your own conclusions and make your own\nopinions.\n\nMost importantly, you’ll know how to order ', 'off the menu and tell the bathrooms apart.\n\nReady?\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  2\n\n\x0cHistory\n\nIf you’d like to skip the walk down memory lane, you can jump to the next section, Getting Started.\n\nOstensibly, the history of .NET begins in October of 2000, at Microsoft’s Professional Developer\nConference (PDC), when Microsoft announced to the world that they were working on a new\nprogramming platform, on which would rest the fate of all Microsoft dev', 'elopment to follow. It was\ncalled .NET, it would be the backbone for their upcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would\nbe a part of their data management system (nicknamed “SQLServer.NET”), and it would form the\ncore development platform for building interconnected applications into the future by leveraging\nemerging standards such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few others the world had not yet really come to\nunderstand. It would be the princip', 'al competitor platform to their principal development rival at the\ntime, Sun Microsystems, and its Java platform. And the world could see that the shot was fired, the\nline in the sand drawn, and the armies drawn up; clearly, this was Microsoft copying the efforts of its\ncompetitors, seeking dominance, and….\n\nAnd most of the world completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it had come to\nexist, and what Microsoft really sought to obtai', 'n from it.\n\nIn fact, it’s fair to suggest that many within the Microsoft ecosystem misunderstood what .NET was\nreally about; once announced, the marketing machine took over. Much effort was wasted due to the\nentanglement of “.NET” with “web services,” and it would take the better part of a decade before\npeople could understand that the two really had nothing intrinsically to do with one another any\nmore than “Perl” did with “databases.” Microsoft', ' management compounded all this confusion by\nre-branding the “.NET” suffix to a number of their products, which they later corrected but well after\nthe damage had been done.\n\nBut despite all that, solid engineering rests at the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made\nit harder to see, but it’s always been there. To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its\nproper historical context: that, in truth, it was the simple “nex', 't step” along an evolutionary chain that\nstretched back much further than that October keynote almost two decades ago.\n\nOf components, managed environments, and code\nIn the beginning, there was C.\n\nTo be more accurate about it, in the beginning a number of programming languages were created\nto make it easier to produce programs that knew how to execute on a single chip. They integrated\ndirectly with the hardware, making use of the facilities ther', 'e to obtain memory, interact with the\ndisk, and present data to the display for the user to understand. In time, we as an industry found that\nthis direct-hardware interaction had its drawbacks, and we sought to create a series of abstractions\non top of that hardware, to help coordinate the use of the hardware across multiple simultaneously\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n 3\n\n\x0cexecuting programs. We called that first attempt at regulating and managing ', 'the hardware an\noperating system. And it was pretty good. So good, in fact, that numerous flavors of operating\nsystem were born, including Microsoft’s Windows operating system, and Solaris, and macOS (though\nit was called “System 7” back then), and Linux, and a few others whose names exist now only in the\nhistory books and dusty corners of Usenet forums. (Bonus points if you recognize these names:\nMinix, Mach, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even more', ' bonus points if you ever ran one of them. If you\never ran DOS, though, it just means you’re old.)\n\nThe bigger, more important issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system\nitself—that programmers found it helpful and useful to have “something else” working with their\nprograms. That “something else” would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs\nexecuted and behaved, rather than assuming that every single n', 'uance had to be the programmers’\nresponsibility.\n\nThis concept, in large, is essentially that of a “managed environment.” Although it has its roots\nin operating systems, it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of\ncontainers and cloud: that there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are\nresponsible for details that the programmer doesn’t want to have to deal with. Operating systems\nare manage', 'd environments in that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to\nschedule the execution of threads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network\nports or data files. Virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in\nthat they regulate the access and reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode\nformat into CPU-native instructions, and prevent the direct access ', 'of memory (except under very\nspecific circumstances) in order to avoid process termination by careless programming. Containers\nsuch as Docker are managed environments in that they provide a context around an executable\nto mimic a precise environment—configuration files, environment variables, and shared network\nsettings—so that developers can be assured that the environment outside their programs are\nconsistent regardless of where they are deploy', 'ed.\n\nBy the early ’90s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for\nWindows developers to be able to take “the next step forward” in development evolution. The “GUI\nrevolution” of the mid-’80s was largely finished; programs weren’t just about “dialogs and data,”\nbut now needed to integrate more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for\nexample) and start taking advantage of networking in greater d', 'etail. (Old developers like me will\nremember that it was around 1995 that references to HTTP and “the World Wide Web” were just\nstarting to appear in publications and technology journals.)\n\nAs is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges emerged. C++ developers\nhad been speaking of “reusable code” for several years, but it was Visual Basic (and Delphi, along with\nseveral other “4GL” variants) that demonstrated actual practical c', 'ode reuse, in the form of “controls”:\nwidgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly without requiring in-depth\nknowledge about the controls’ implementation. Simply obtain the library, put it into the right place\nwithin the development environment, drag-and-drop the control into the construction area, and lo,\nthe developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of “application frameworks,”\nlike MFC and OWL, but', ' “GUI builders” had demonstrated that the concept of “controls” could be\nleveraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and events; now\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n   4\n\n\x0cMicrosoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the bigger world beyond GUI development.\nMore importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship—make it possible for outside\ndevelopers to build “things” that could be used by exist', 'ing things (such as the operating system or,\nperhaps, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their implementation.\n\nTo do that, they needed to create a managed environment that would work across a variety of\ndifferent languages, but all operating under the same rules. That effort, called the Component\nObject Model (COM), was the first of several “managed platforms” that emerged during the early-\nand mid-’90s. (Ironically, several open-sou', 'rce efforts would go after this same space many years\nafter Microsoft declared COM “finished,” including Mozilla’s XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in\nthat it became the backbone of Windows development for a significant percentage of the Windows\nplatform. But it still failed in that it left programs vulnerable to many of the same things that had\nplagued them before: memory leaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpected process termination at\nthe fir', 'st mistake. It was clear that, despite the managed platform, writing code in a “native” language\n(such as C/C++ or Delphi) still wasn’t a particularly great place to be.\n\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that Sun Microsystems demonstrated the HotJava browser\nto the world, the centerpiece of which was this language that could be used to write executable\nbits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft had come to the realization that thi', 's was what it\nwas missing: a “managed language” to run on top of their managed platform. A managed language\nhad exactly the right “distance” from the underlying operating system they were seeking—garbage\ncollection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashes, and the virtual machine could\nhelp enforce stronger security controls that the world had just started to realize they needed. It was,\nin many ways, a perfect match. Microsoft inve', 'sted resources into building their own JVM, extended\ntheir IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrated COM into the runtime.\n\nUnfortunately, in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own destruction.\n\nHello, .NET\nDivorces are never a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one is always fraught with opinion,\nrevisionist history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997/1998, two facts were becoming clear:', '\none, Sun didn’t care for Microsoft’s work increasing interoperability between their JVM and native\nCOM components in Windows1, and two, Microsoft and Java were going to part ways, one way or\nanother. (Who got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)\n\nEither certain groups within Microsoft could see the writing on the wall or they had come to find\nissues (real or perceived) with the Java Virtual Machine; either way, by 1998, a new effort came ', 'to\nlife inside of Microsoft, designed to bring a new managed platform and managed language into the\nworld. Originally intended as the successor to COM, it went through a variety of names, including\n\n1 For the curious, Microsoft offered additional platform-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with native\nCOM components. The irony of this is deep, considering that Sun had actually allowed for COM-specific\nnative interfaces in their JNI speci', 'fication—the first three methods in the interface table for a JNIEnv (“JNI\nenvironment”) object were specifically left “reserved” for the necessary three methods (AddRef, Release, and\nQueryInterface) of every COM interface object. Those three slots are still reserved to this day.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n   5\n\n\x0c“COM+,” the “Component Object Runtime” (COR), the “Universal RunTime” (URT), and “Next-\nGeneration Windows Services” (NGWS) before fina', 'lly being introduced to the world as “.NET” at that\nOctober 2000 PDC. Along with it would come a new language, code-named “COOL” (supposedly\nto stand for the “Component-Oriented Object Language,” although opinions vary now) and later\nrenamed “C#.”\n\nWhile most observers considered C# and the CLR (the Common Language Runtime, the virtual\nmachine executing the bytecode) to be direct competitors of Java, Microsoft took careful steps to\nensure that it', ' was “open” in ways that Java was not: where the JVM was designed from the beginning\nto be a virtual machine for a single language, the CLR embraced a more polyglot approach, with\nMicrosoft even going so far as to recruit several universities and companies to create new languages\nfor this platform and/or adapt existing ones. This project, nicknamed “Project 7” (for the 7 groups\nthat participated), debuted several of these languages during .NET’s ', 'introduction, and included CLR\nflavors of Eiffel, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of these languages gained any traction after the first\nfew years of existence, and most no longer exist, but their presence had the effect on Microsoft of\n“keeping them honest” with respect to other languages beyond C# and Visual Basic as the platform\ngrew and evolved. (Microsoft itself would later go on to introduce a number of new CLR-based\nlanguages, including a com', 'piled-to-binary version of ECMAScript, two different efforts at bringing\nmanaged coding to C++, a hybrid object/functional language called F#, and several more research\nlanguages.)\n\nHowever, Microsoft also sought to make sure that .NET was not a proprietary effort by investing\nthousands of man-hours into the creation of a series of international specifications—through the\nEuropean Computer Manufacturer’s Association (ECMA2)—to ensure that C# and ', 'the underlying\nplatform were both open industry standards. C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and the\nunderlying runtime was given the name the “Common Language Infrastructure” (CLI), and accepted\nand ratified as ECMA-335. Intel, HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in\nkeeping these specifications up to date with changes to the language and the platform, the most\nrecent updates3 coming in 2012 for the CLI and 2017 f', 'or C#.\n\nWith the introduction of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpected side-effect: members of\nthe open-source community began to examine building a “clean-room” implementation of them.\nWhile the CLI Specification didn’t include any of the Windows-specific features (such as a deep COM\nintegration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution for their existing\ndeveloper base, the CLI Specification itself provided ', 'enough integration points to make it interesting\nto implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one such project, calling\nit Mono.\n\nThe specification also gave Microsoft some room to do what some within the company had been\nlooking to do for quite a while: provide a research and experimentation vehicle for the academic and\nresearch communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripped-down version of the CLR\nsourc', 'e code, code-named “Rotor,” distributed under an open-source license they created, called the\n\n2 ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification for the language commonly known as “JavaScript,” but is\nmore rightly called “ECMAScript,” governed as ECMA-262.\n3 CLI: https://www.iso.org/standard/58046.html and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/\nEcma-335.htm; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecm', 'a-334.htm\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n   6\n\n\x0c“Shared Source” license, giving it the formal name “Shared Source CLI” or “SSCLI.” While Mono would\nremain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, and Rotor of even less interest to\nthose outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source mindset were sown. Over time, Mono\nwould be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own company, Xamarin, which would faithfully\nparallel', ' the work described by the specifications and periodically try out new ideas for the open-\nsource community to consider.\n\nMicrosoft officially released the first version of C# and the CLR in 2002, and new versions came\nroughly three years apart after that: C# 2.0 in 2005, and C# 3.0 in 2008. Each was contained in a\nproduct release of Visual Studio, such that C# 2.0 and version 2.0 of the CLR runtime was released\nwith Visual Studio 2005, and C# 3.', '0 and CLR 3.5 came with Visual Studio 2008. Microsoft then shifted\nto a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, and most\nrecently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the versions of C# and the CLR started falling out of lockstep\nwith Visual Studio, deliberately, for a couple of reasons.\n\nThe first was that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, and was starting to\nunbundle its var', 'ious parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independent, parts. F#, which\nfirst shipped “out of the box” in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to start down the open-\nsource path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project, it had never really\nembraced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place. Microsoft started\nworking shortly thereafter on an open-source rewrite of its enti', 're compiler toolchain, code-named\n“Roslyn.” By the time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem were starting to ship\nindependently, with Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for developers to gather the parts\nof the ecosystem they desired more easily. Open-source package management (called NuGet), which\nbegan life well outside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated into Visual Studio so that\nNuGet came “o', 'ut of the box,” much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java IDEs.\n\nMono, meanwhile, had started to gain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular, the\ngaming toolkit Unity had expressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running\ninside the Unity toolkit. Unity-based games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the\nJavaScript-on-.NET implementation that Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a P', 'ython-\ninspired .NET language called Boo. Additionally, the open-source community produced another .NET\nimplementation, the .NET Micro Framework, specifically aimed at embedded software systems and\nsmall-scale hardware such as the Arduino platform.\n\nAll of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, Microsoft announced that the source\nfor ASP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to anyone who wanted to look at it. It\nwa', 'sn’t full open-source yet, though, in that they weren’t accepting pull requests. It was, however,\nan important step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It announced that it would completely\nopen-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making it available to any platform and accept\npull requests from any developer so inclined. A new .NET implementation would be completely\nopen-source and hosted on GitHub, called .NET Core. It a', 'lso announced the creation of the .NET\nFoundation, an industry consortium of groups dedicated to the growth of the .NET platform, in\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n   7\n\n\x0cmuch the same fashion that the Java Community Process governs the continued growth of the Java\nplatform4.\n\nTo be sure, Microsoft made some missteps along the way, and definitely learned a few hard lessons\nabout its relationship with the open-source community, but by late 2017, Micro', 'soft was statistically\nthe biggest contributor on GitHub (measured in terms of total numbers of contributors5), and all\nof its key components—language, runtime, libraries, and many of its tools—were available for\ndownload on GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft also started to get more serious about the cross-platform/portability aspects of the .NET\necosystem. Xamarin, which by 2009 had started producing tools that could cross-compile .NET\nbytecode into native app', 'lications for iOS and Android platforms (the catchy-named “MonoDroid”\nand less-catchy “Mono for iOS” toolkits), was flourishing, and Microsoft realized that a practical story\nfor being able to share non-UI portions of code across multiple platforms was necessary if they\nwanted to avoid developer confusion.\n\nWhile the ECMA Specifications had discussed different “profiles” for levels of .NET standardization,\nthese profiles were in many ways similar', ' to their “Java Standard Edition,” “Java Micro Edition,” and\n“Java Enterprise Edition” cousins—a little unwieldy in a number of ways, but most notably in that\nthere wasn’t really a good way to guarantee compatibility across platforms and implementation\nversions—if code is compiled by the Java6 compiler, it is safe to assume that it will continue to run on\nthe Java6 virtual machine from whence it was compiled, but the Java APIs do change from rele', 'ase to\nrelease, and this has tripped up the unwary Java developer from time to time.\n\nThus, in 2016, Microsoft announced the “.NET Standard 1.0” profile, a collection not of relatively\nvague implementation documents, but an actual API standard, such that a developer who sought\nto build a library that could be used by a variety of different platforms (across a certain number of\nversions of that platform, even) could know that anything that impleme', 'nted .NET Standard 1.0 would\nbe able to consume that library, regardless of where that code is running—on a web server, on a\nmobile device, or even on somebody’s VR helmet (running a 3D interactive application written with\nUnity).\n\nWhich brings us, now, to the current day.\n\n4 Ironically, Microsoft’s move to the .NET Foundation comes at the same time Oracle is looking to move\naway from the JCP; both companies have experience with standards organiz', 'ations, and neither wants to see\ninnovation stifled in committee.\n5 http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-open-source-2016-9\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n   8\n\n\x0cHello, strange new world\nTo the Java developer, this is a strange, strange world compared to the one they glimpsed into back\nin 2000.\n\nFor starters, the Java world looks wildly different than it once did. Sun no longer exists, acquired\nby Oracle. Oracle and Google squabble in the ', 'courtroom over the legal implications of Java on\nAndroid devices. Spring was acquired, then spun out into its own company, Pivotal. JBoss absorbed\ninto Red Hat. IBM no longer really even tries to push Java much anymore. Does anybody even\nremember EJB? Or that it was once “a thing”? Who would’ve guessed any of this back in 2001?\n\nBut meanwhile, over in the Microsoft world, a new CEO runs the firm, and he has made it clear that\nMicrosoft is an open', '-source player. A new player, to be sure, and still finding its feet in a variety of\nways, but one committed to the open-source community. In addition to the strides it has made with\n.NET, Microsoft has opened Azure up to almost every mainstream language and platform—including\nJava. (Yes, you can run Tomcat and MySQL in an Azure cloud cluster.) SQL Server has been ported\nto Linux. Windows Server can be loaded into a Docker container, and Microsof', 't works with the\nDocker community to bring Docker-on-Windows up to the same level of sublime that it has on other\nplatforms.\n\nWithin the .NET ecosystem, the .NET Standard, now at a 2.0 release, provides an umbrella of\nguaranteed compatibility across three major platforms of this writing: the Windows-based .NET\nFramework (which contains the necessary libraries for building Windows client applications, for\nexample), .NET Core (intended for the cros', 's-platform server world, including Docker containers\nand cloud-native targets), and Xamarin (principally aimed at the iOS and Android world, but also\nproviding bindings for building macOS applications). Unity has joined the .NET Foundation and\nexpects to be aligned with the various versions of .NET Standard by mid-2018.\n\nAll of which means that it’s not a bad time to start exploring this world in more depth.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n   9\n\n\x0cGett', 'ing Started: Tooling\n\nGetting started with .NET depends pretty heavily on your choice of operating system and, to a lesser\ndegree, the development experience you want. As mentioned earlier, Visual Studio supports both\nWindows and macOS, as well as a variety of Linux distributions, which pretty much covers everybody.\nIn this section, the goal is to get tools installed, a basic introduction to the major project artifacts,\nand, of course, build the ', 'traditional “HelloWorld.” Once we’ve done that, we’ll talk a little bit about\nwhat we’re producing, and the package system for .NET (called NuGet).\n\nHello, web?\nIf you’re just looking to flirt a little with the C# language but don’t want to commit any disk space\nto the idea, one of the easiest ways to explore the language is the online interactive browser-based\ntutorial found at https://aka.ms/csharpquickstarts.\n\nHowever, doing so will run into a', ' whole slew of limitations to your exploration, so sooner or later\nyou’re probably going to want to commit some disk space.\n\nDocker all the things!\nIf you’re a Docker enthusiast, and you want to get the quickest path possible to working with .NET,\nfire up a Microsoft-maintained .NET Core Docker container by running:\n\ndocker run -it microsoft/dotnet bash\n\nThis will pull the latest version of Microsoft’s Docker Hub–stored Docker images, and drop yo', 'u into\na shell prompt from which you can run the “dotnet” CLI tool. When you are ready to edit some files,\nrun the Docker image with a volume mount to a host’s local directory, and use your favorite editor—\nmight we suggest Visual Studio Code?—to edit the .NET Core–generated files we’re about to create.\n\nLinux .NET?\nAs with most things Linux, installation instructions depend on which flavor of Linux you’re running.\n\nRed Hat is the easiest install', ', since Microsoft and Red Hat have partnered on a few things in the past,\nso the .NET Core packages are in the Red Hat distribution channels; assuming you are using the\nRed Hat Subscription Manager, two commands get .NET Core on your machine:\n\nyum install rh-dotnet20 -y\nscl enable rh-dotnet20 bash\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n   10\n\n\x0cAt that point, the “dotnet” tool should be in your PATH and good to go.\n\nIf you’re on Ubuntu, there’s a bit more wor', 'k required. While Microsoft is working to get the .NET\nCore packages into the standard Ubuntu distribution channels, at the time of this writing that hasn’t\nhappened completely, so Ubuntu users will need to add Microsoft’s key and Ubuntu-release-specific\nURL into the list of sources the Ubuntu apt-get utilities check for packages. Full details are on the\n.NET Core website at www.dot.net/core; once that’s done, however, apt-get can install the “do', 'tnet-\nsdk-2.1.101” package onto the system, and this will get the “dotnet” tool in the PATH and good to go.\n\nThis “register the channel” followed by “use the standard package manager” is actually the same\nstory for Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, and Debian; again, full step-by-step instructions are on the\n.NET Core “Getting Started” page (https://aka.ms/dotnet-getstarted-linux), which has a drop-down\nto choose between the six flavors of Linux that .NE', 'T Core supports. Add the Microsoft feed to the\npackage manager, use the package manager to do the install, and the “dotnet” tool should be\navailable on the PATH.\n\nOnce that’s done, .NET Core is ready to go.\n\nVisual Studio Code\nFor almost any operating system you might find yourself using, including most of the popular\ndistributions of Linux, Microsoft has a lightweight editor called Visual Studio Code. If you’ve been\ndoing a lot of web front-end ', 'work, you may already have been using it. In many ways, it’s the latest\nattempt at building an “editor-plus-plug-ins” tool, and it is gaining some traction with the world\noutside the Microsoft ecosystem. (It’s actually the preferred tool for working with Google’s open-\nsource Angular project, among other things.) It’s also available from http://code.visualstudio.com,\nit’s available for Windows, macOS, and most of the major flavors of Linux, and i', 't’s a pretty quick\ndownload and install. And, honestly, it’s not a bad editor for writing Java code, in case you were\nwondering; check out the Java extensions at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/extensions the\nnext time you’re looking for a lightweight editor that understands Java projects.\n\nFiring up Visual Studio Code from the command-line is often just a simple “code” if you’re in the root\ndirectory of your project.\n\n.NET for Java Devel', 'opers\n\n  11\n\n\x0cMac .NET?\nIf you’re like a lot of Java developers (myself included), you own a macOS machine. It might surprise\nyou to know that many of the developers at Microsoft do, too. (Some of them repaved it with\nWindows, but a lot of them run native macOS.) Doing .NET on macOS falls into one of two options.\n\nOne is the command-line approach, which you can obtain via Homebrew. For the moment, using\nHomebrew requires tapping a cask, but after', " that, it’s as simple as doing the classic “brew install”\nthing:\n\n$ brew tap caskroom/cask #if you haven't already\n$ brew cask install dotnet-sdk\n\nThis will run a custom installer script that will put .NET Core onto your machine, so it’s not completely\nHomebrew-friendly, but it “does the job.” Once finished, fire up a new Terminal window (to pick up\nthe environment changes that the installer makes) and run:\n\n$ dotnet --version\n2.1.1\n\n.NET for Jav", 'a Developers\n\n  12\n\n\x0cWhich should respond with “2.<something>,” depending on which version is published as of the time\nyou read this.\n\nIf you’re a bit more of an IDE fan, however, you’re still in luck. With its acquisition of Xamarin,\nMicrosoft also acquired Xamarin’s IDE for the Mac, which was just recently re-branded to be called\n“Visual Studio for Mac.” Based on the open-source “MonoDevelop” project, it’s not quite as extensive\nan IDE experien', 'ce as Visual Studio, owing to a smaller set of plug-ins developed for it, but that can\nactually make it more enjoyable to use sometimes, particularly if all you’re looking for is a good\neditor, project management system, and debugger.\n\nInstalling Visual Studio for Mac is a pretty straightforward experience—http://visualstudio.com has\na link for an installer that, when opened, will go through the usual Mac installation process. There\nare a number ', 'of options here that aren’t absolutely necessary for our purposes, but since a complete\ninstall is measured only in single-digit gigabytes of disk space, unless you’re constrained for space,\nwhy not just keep it simple and install it all?\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  13\n\n\x0cOnce started, take a few minutes to grab some coffee; like its cousin on Windows, Visual Studio\nfor Mac will download the components it needs and install them to disk. Don’t wal', 'k away from the\nmachine for too long, however—the installer will ask for the administrator password several times\nduring the installation.\n\nWindows: Visual Studio\nLastly, if you’re running Windows, the most obvious option is installing Visual Studio—that\ncombination has been the default for Windows-based development for close to two decades, and\nmost Java developers know enough already to realize that. What many don’t realize is that there is a\nf', 'ree-to-download “Community Edition” that has all the core parts of the IDE and toolchain: compiler,\ndebugger, editor, project management, and so on. You can find the Visual Studio Community\nEdition via your favorite search engine or wander on over to http://visualstudio.com to grab an\ninstaller. Make sure you’re on a good Internet connection, since 98% of the install is coming from the\nMicrosoft servers.\n\nWhen the Visual Studio installer fires up', ', it immediately becomes obvious that this is every bit as\nlarge of an installation as Eclipse or IDEA—hundreds of options lie before you. While most of them\nare not necessary (many of them have to do with building unmanaged C++ code, for example, or\nfor building game projects), selecting all of them will help ensure that anything you might look to\nexplore will be available to you. The total install size is about the same as your favorite Java ID', 'E\nwith all the trimmings, when all is said and done. Alternatively, you can select just “.NET Core Cross-\nplatform development” for a streamlined install of just .NET Core.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  14\n\n\x0cIf all of this seems a little hard to remember, honestly, you’re not wrong. Remember, Microsoft is\nfairly new to this “make it work on all platforms” story, and they’re constantly trying to improve the\nwhole experience, which in the past has r', 'esulted in some churn and confusion. One of the things\nthey’ve done in 2017 is to try to collect all their .NET-related resources together into a single URL for\neasy reference. That URL, www.dot.net, is the place to start, and will end up redirecting to the main\nMicrosoft site dedicated to the .NET ecosystem. It’s an overview of all the different things one can do\nwith .NET, as well as the different platform installers. Probably the most useful t', 'hings are the button-\nlinks to “Get Started” and “Download”; the latter takes you to a collection of different download\nlinks, and the former takes you to a series of tutorial steps to getting started building a console\n“HelloWorld” application. (Sounds familiar, no?)\n\nHello, dotnet: CLI style\nRegardless of how you’ve got the command-line tooling on your machine, it all boils down to one\nthing: The machine has a command-line tool called “dotnet” ', 'that’s in the PATH and hooked up to an\nInternet connection. Away we go.\n\nThe “dotnet” tool, in many ways, is a re-examination of the thought process that Maven brought into\nthe world: a command-line tool that can generate out a project based on customizable/extensible\ntemplates stored in the cloud, as well as act as a single point-of-control for building, running,\ntesting, and any other commands that need to happen to a given project. The “dotnet', '” tool hides a\nfair amount of .NET Core’s machinery, in the same way that Maven hides a fair amount of the Java\nmachinery (CLASSPATH references, for example), so keep in mind that we’re only looking at the tip of\nthe iceberg as we work with this. (Make no mistake—the tooling here goes just as deep and just as\nwide as anything we’ve ever used in the Java world, and it’s just as easy to get lost in it if we dive too\ndeeply into it too quickly.)\n\nTo', ' start a .NET Core application, we can use “dotnet” to generate a project based on the “console”\napplication template, like so:\n\n$ dotnet new console -o HelloWorld\n\nThis will generate a “console” project into the directory “HelloWorld”; for those who are curious,\n“dotnet new” by itself, or “dotnet new --list,” will list all of the project templates that the “dotnet”\ncommand knows about. Out of the box, it has about a dozen or so project templates', ', including\nconsole applications, class libraries, a half-dozen flavors of web projects, and so on. This list is\nexpected to grow and evolve as time goes on, just as the list of Maven archetypes grew after its\nrelease. Note that the list also allows generation of projects across different languages, so those who\nreally want to sneak a peek at what an F# Web API project would look like can run:\n\n$ dotnet new webapi -o HelloFSAPI -lang F#\n\nASP.NET ', 'Web API will be discussed in a little more detail later in this paper; however interesting,\nthough, F# is not something we’re going to explore here. You can learn more at fsharp.org.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  15\n\n\x0cImplicit in the “new” command is a request to download all of the dependencies that a project\nrequires, which in “dotnet” parlance is a command to “restore.” This requests all of the dependent\nassemblies—JAR file equivalents, essenti', 'ally—from a Maven-like, cloud-based service called\nNuGet. NuGet was heavily inspired by Maven and Ruby gems, which means, for the most part, it\nworks the same way Maven does—when doing a “dotnet restore,” the machine must be connected\nto the Internet, and depending on the size of the project, could take a while to download all the\ndependencies.\n\nOnce the project has been “restore”d, all of the dependencies are downloaded, and the application\ncan ', 'be run by using “dotnet run” from within the project directory. This will, not surprisingly, print\n“Hello World!” to the terminal. If outside of the project directory, tell “dotnet” which project to run\nby passing a reference to the project file (HelloWorld.csproj6) in via the “--project” command-line\nargument:\n\n$ dotnet run --project HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj\nHello World!\n\nIf you’re inside the project directory, this becomes a simple “dotnet ', 'run”; .NET assemblies know their\nentry point intrinsically.\n\nIf you’re feeling curious, poke into the “bin/Debug” directory underneath HelloWorld; in it resides the\ngenerated compiler artifacts, including the .NET assembly, “HelloWorld.dll,” and its debugger support\nfile, “HelloWorld.pdb.” It may seem strange that one would “execute” a DLL, but an assembly, like a\nJAR file, is a repository of bytecode (but with much tighter cohesion than a JAR fi', 'le provides), and the\nextension is (for the most part) almost entirely irrelevant. The dotnet launcher serves much the same\npurpose as the Java launcher does: to find the assembly specified on the command-line, load it, then\nexecute the entry point method and get out of the way.\n\nHello, .NET: IDE style\nIf Visual Studio (or Visual Studio for Mac) has finished installing, fire it up, and either select “File | New\nProject,” or use the Start Page dis', 'played in the center of the IDE to begin a new project by clicking\none of the “New Project” templates. Depending on which Visual Studio you’re running, you may be\npresented with two kinds of console applications: one that represents a native Console Application\n(for Windows, it will reference .NET Framework) and one that targets .NET Core (that’s the open-\nsource implementation). Choose either one (I prefer .NET Core), then do the usual IDE thing', ' of\nchoosing which directory in which the project should live, and its name. Note that we can designate\nthis as a Git repository as well. Once finished, Visual Studio will think for a bit, then show the finished\ntemplate, complete with C# code, ready for editing, building, and debugging.\n\n6 The .NET Core tooling took a bit of a detour recently through the world of JSON by working off of a “project.\njson” file, which is still mentioned in a number', ' of .NET Core tutorials; that has been deprecated in favor of the\nMSBuild-based files, and is no longer supported. JSON is still used for a number of configuration files, but the\n.NET community reacted pretty strongly to the use of JSON for the project files, and Microsoft, looking to be a\ngood open-source steward, responded to that feedback by backtracking and moving back to MSBuild.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  16\n\n\x0cBuilding the code (Ctrl-Shif', 't-B on Windows, Command-B on macOS) produces a console application\n(a native Windows .exe for Windows or a .NET Core project for macOS), which can either be built by\nnavigating to the “Debug/bin” subdirectory of the project and running it directly or by launching it\nfrom within Visual Studio.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  17\n\n\x0cThe debugger works the same as it does within any IDE, and Visual Studio has its share of rich\ndebugger tricks (which are ', 'really beyond the scope of this article, but easy to find https://aka.ms/\nvsdebugger). HelloWorld, achievement unlocked.\n\nSolutions and projects\nWithin the Visual Studio ecosystem, code is arranged into “projects,” which are in turn collected\ninto “solutions.” A project is language-specific, and sports an XML file whose extension reflects that\nlanguage—C# projects are stored in “.csproj” files, for example. Each project produces one artifact—\nan ', 'assembly, which we’ll discuss in more detail later. Solutions, then, are made up of any number\nof projects listed in a solution file (.sln), making it quite common for a solution to have some top-\nlevel “executable” (whether that is a website project, Web API project, or some form of GUI project)\nwith one or more “library” projects to support it. It’s extremely common, in fact, to see projects in\nseparate subdirectories under the directory in whi', 'ch the solution file lives. This arrangement won’t\nseem strange to the working Java developer; in many respects, this is no different from what we\nwould see in a Java codebase, where some collection of code (project) produces a JAR file, and a\nMaven or Gradle build (solution) brings it all together into a bundle of some form.\n\nMicrosoft is working to keep all these file types in sync across all versions of Visual Studio, so that\na project that bu', 'ilds on Visual Studio for Mac should also build on Windows, using an underlying\nbuild system called “MSBuild.” Heavily Ant-inspired, MSBuild has been the build system for .NET since\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  18\n\n\x0cVisual Studio 2005, and Xamarin was quick to adopt it for their project file system when they started\nbuilding out their toolchain.\n\nGoodbye, HelloWorld\nTooling is now installed. The Gods of Computer Science have been appeased by the ', 'creation of a\nsuccessful HelloWorld application. It’s time to take a pass across the C# language.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  19\n\n\x0cC#, Succinctly\n\nWhile we can’t cover the entirety of the C# language in half a dozen pages, we can cover the key\nconcepts of C# pretty quickly. In fact, we can do it in one sentence: C# is an object-oriented language\nthat borrows heavily from its lexical ancestors, C++ and Java, and from other “component”-oriented\nla', 'nguages such as Delphi. In recent years, C# (like most languages) has begun to incorporate\nmore functional programming concepts into its syntax, and as a result presents a pretty multi-\nparadigmatic set of capabilities.\n\nIn other words, take Java, throw in a number of the features Java developers have debated for a\ndecade or more, then add a bunch of functional programming concepts, stir well, bake for 15 years,\nand serve. Microsoft’s language de', 'signers have been much more aggressive than Sun’s when it\ncomes to introducing new features into their respective languages, so for the most part a Java\ndeveloper’s experience with C# will probably be characterized by “Oh, sure, that all looks pretty\nsimilar—wait, what is THAT?”\n\nBy the way, C# currently sits at version 7.2 at the time of this writing, and Microsoft’s language\ndesigners have been just as aggressive in the latest revisions of the ', 'language as they were in the\nearly ones. This is a language under constant evolution, for good or for ill. So there’s much to discuss,\nand we will not be able to cover the entire surface area of the language—the focus here will be only\non those parts that will be unintuitive to the Java developer looking at “average” C# code.\n\nC# Basics\nTo begin, let’s take a look at what was generated as part of those “HelloWorld” console applications,\nsince tha', 't’s probably the easiest way to get started.\n\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloDotNet\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIt’s pretty easy to spot a number of things right off the bat: C# is a C-family language, using curly-\nbrackets to denote scope blocks and semicolons to terminate statements. Code is organized into\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n', '  20\n\n\x0cnamespaces using the “namespace” keyword, and pretty clearly we have classes just as Java does.\nThe Console class (part of the “System” namespace) represents the command-line input/output\nfacilities, and WriteLine is obviously a synonym for “println.” Square brackets are used to denote an\narray in the same way they do in Java, and arrays in C# work almost exactly the same way as they do\nin Java, save that they have been slightly more “form', 'alized” in that there is a full-blown class, System.\nArray, that defines a number of methods and properties that all arrays will share. Core “primitive”\ntypes are actually defined as full-blown classes, so that System.Array is the “class” representing each\narray instance, System.String is the “string” primitive type, System.Int32 is the “int” primitive type,\nand so on. All types, whether “primitive” (what .NET calls “value types”) or “class,” all', ' inherit from\nthe base System.Object type, with value types being “boxed” to objects when necessary. (This was\nthe inspiration for autoboxing rules in Java5, in fact.) As a result, “System.String s” and “string s” are\nactually entirely equivalent declarations. New value types can be defined, but it’s pretty rare.\n\nLet’s start with some of the more straightforward parts of the language.\n\nStarting exploration: classes, properties,\nand methods\nC# 1.', '0 was, in large measure, a near-direct clone of Java, with some keyword changes and some new\nfeatures that Java has debated for years: explicit properties and delegates (an early form of lambda\nexpressions). Thus, we can write the traditional “Person” type in C# like so:\n\nclass Person\n{\n    public string FirstName\n    {\n        get { return this.firstName; }\n        set { this.firstName = value; }\n    }\n    private string firstName;\n\n    public s', 'tring LastName\n    {\n        get { return this.lastName; }\n        set { this.lastName = value; }\n    }\n    private string lastName;\n\n    public int Age\n    {\n        get { return this.age; }\n        set { this.age = value; }\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n 21\n\n\x0c    }\n    private int age;\n    public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n    {\n        this.FirstName = fn;\n        this.LastName = ln;\n        this.Age = a;\n    }\n}\n\nProperties can be read-', 'only by eliminating the “set” clause, and write-only (if that makes sense,\nwhich it rarely does) by eliminating the “get” clause. The implicit parameter to a “set” clause is always\ncalled “value,” and there are no restrictions to what a property-get or property-set clause can do\nwithin its body, although 95% of the time they simply read and write a field within the class.\n\nSo far, if anything, it seems more verbose than Java. However, that was th', 'e C# language as of 15\nyears ago—they’ve made a few changes along the way.\n\nOne very common change is to the requirement to actually provide a body to the property-get and\nproperty-set clauses; as is the case in Java, 95% of the time these clauses simply wrap around a field\nand provide encapsulated access and nothing else. Which means, frankly, that the time spent writing\nthe implementation for these is pretty much a waste of time (and something ', 'that IDEA or other IDEs\ncan generate for us). The C# language designers agreed, and in C# 3.0 added the concept of “auto-\nimplemented properties,” which asks the C# compiler to not only generate the property method\nimplementations, but also synthesize the field used for the backing store. This simplifies the Person\nclass down to:\n\nclass Person\n{\n    public string FirstName { get; set; }\n    public string LastName { get; set; }\n    public int Age ', '{ get; set; }\n\n    public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n    {\n        this.FirstName = fn;\n        this.LastName = ln;\n        this.Age = a;\n    }\n}\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  22\n\n\x0cThat’s…awfully terse. But what about those scenarios where we want to have the property available\nto be read by anyone (public access), but only accessible for mutation from within the class (private\naccess)? The get and set clauses can have different levels of', ' access, the most common idiom being:\n\nclass Person\n{\n    public string FirstName { get; private set; }\n    public string LastName { get; private set; }\n    public int Age { get; private set; }\n\n    public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n    {\n        this.FirstName = fn;\n        this.LastName = ln;\n        this.Age = a;\n    }\n}\n\nThis will effectively make the fields immutable from the outside yet still something we can\nchange from the interi', 'or of the class. The field itself is synthesized by the compiler (usually with\na straightforward name such as “__$<Person>$<FirstName>@5417,” or something equally non-\nobvious), and won’t be directly accessible by code. (Granted, one can always use System.Reflection—\nthe .NET direct equivalent to Java’s java.lang.reflect package—to access the field at runtime, but\nthat’s an awful lot of work to work around something that can be discarded at any t', 'ime.) For those\nrare situations where the auto-generated properties don’t do the right thing, C# developers can\nalways “drop back” to writing the property clauses out longhand and wrapping a declared field.\n\nMethods, meanwhile, work pretty much the same way they do in Java, in terms of their declaration\nand syntax. Methods can be instance methods or static (although static method invocations must\nalways go through the class name, whereas Java wil', 'l allow calling a static method through an\ninstance variable—seriously, try it, it’s weird), and parameters are declared in order with a type and a\nname:\n\npublic class Person\n{\n    public string FirstName { get; set; }\n    public string LastName { get; set; }\n    public int Age { get; set; }\n\n    public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n    {\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  23\n\n\x0c        this.FirstName = fn;\n        this.LastName = ln;\n        this', '.Age = a;\n    }\n    public void SayHello(string recipient)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine("Hello, {0}, I, {1}, say hello.",\n            recipient, FirstName);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Person p = new Person("Ted", "Neward", 46);\n        p.SayHello("Fred");\n    }\n}\n\nAs you can see, C# follows pretty much exactly the same rules that Java does for method declaration\nand invocation. But, again, C# all', 'ows for some interesting variations on this theme.\n\nFor starters, C# has had the concept of “method literals” since 1.0, though the syntax has changed\nover each successive revision of the language. The first step was “delegates,” essentially the ability\nto declare a method signature and then assign methods-on-object-instances to a given delegate\ninstance, like so:\n\nclass Person\n{\n    // . . .\n    public delegate void HelloProc(string recipient);\n', '    public HelloProc IndirectSayHello;\n}\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Person p = new Person("Ted", "Neward", 46);\n        p.SayHello("Fred");\n\n        p.IndirectSayHello = p.SayHello;\n        p.IndirectSayHello("Fred");\n    }\n}\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  24\n\n\x0cThis was a pretty verbose way of doing method-reference-capture, and with successive versions of\nC#, they simplified it, particularly once the .NET pla', 'tform introduced generics. (Yes, C# has generics,\nyes they look syntactically almost identical to Java generics, but no, they don’t work the same way\nwhen compiled—where Java uses “type erasure,” C# uses “reified generics” and persists the generic\ndefinition all the way into the compiled bytecode.) The “delegate” keyword here introduces a new\ntype—a function pointer, if you will—and we can declare an instance of the delegate on the Person\nclass, ', 'assign a method to it, and invoke the assigned method through that delegate.\n\nLambdas, type inference, and extension classes\nBy the time C# 3.0 came around, however, C# supported full-bore lambda syntax, complete with\nmethod parameter type inference, so that we could write method literals in-line:\n\n        p.IndirectSayHello = (recipient) => {\n            Console.WriteLine("Hey, {0}. Whatever.", recipient);\n        };\n        p.IndirectSayHello("', 'Shaggy");\n\nLambdas turned out to be a major turning point within the C# language, along with several other\nfeatures of the C# 3.0 release, including local variable type inference, which simply allows for the\nkeyword “var” to appear in place of the type in a local variable declaration, like so:\n\n        var x = 12;\n        var y = "Fred";\n        var z = p.IndirectSayHello;\n        z("Wilma");\n\nThe “var” keyword does not, as some in the Java world', ' theorized at its introduction, create an\nuntyped variable; the C# compiler simply infers the variable’s type from the right-hand-side\nexpression, and assigns that to the variable type. Thus, the “x” variable is strongly typed as an\ninteger (since that is an integer literally on the right-hand side), “y” is a string, and “z” is a delegate\nthat accepts a method reference that takes a single string parameter and returns void. All the\n“var” keyword ', 'does, simply, is allow the C# developer a brief respite from having to type out type\nsignatures in places where the compiler could figure it out on its own.\n\nOn top of this, Microsoft also introduced a fascinating feature called “extension classes,” which has\nfound its way into other languages such as Swift. In short, a class can write “extension methods”\nthat can effectively “inject” themselves as method declarations onto other classes, adding n', 'ew\nfunctionality to classes already compiled. (It’s vaguely reminiscent of aspects as described by\nAspectJ, but a strictly limited subset thereof.)\n\nFor example, assume that it’s becoming really common to want to count the number of words in\na given String. In the earliest days of Java, it was assumed that we could extend the String class to\nadd that kind of functionality, but Sun very quickly clamped down on that, made String final, and\n\n.NET fo', "r Java Developers\n\n  25\n\n\x0cearned the (short-lived) wrath of Java developers everywhere. Java developers were forced to write\n“StringUtils” classes that had static methods on them to count the words in a string, similar to this C#\nequivalent:\n\npublic class StringUtils\n{\n    public static int WordCount(String str)\n    {\n        return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' },\n                   StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;\n    }\n}\n\n", 'Frankly, though, using this left a pretty bitter taste in everybody’s mouth, since it smacked of doing\nprocedural programming. Java developers just learned to live with it; C# language designers said,\n“We can go one step better.” If you agree that the class will never have any instance data and never\nbe instantiated as an instance (declare the class “static”), then it can use the first parameter to declare\na “this” parameter, and essentially decl', "are a method that will appear on the targeted class, like so:\n\npublic static class MyStringExtensions\n{\n    public static int WordCount(this String str)\n    {\n        return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' },\n                        StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;\n    }\n}\n\n(Note that “String” is shorthand for “System.String,” which is a synonym for the earlier type “string.”\nAll of the “primitive types” in C# are aliases for t", 'he System-namespaced types, so “int” is the same\nas “System.Int32,” and so on. This has to do with how C# allows the declaration of “value types,” and\nwhile a fascinating discussion in its own right, it’s a little out-of-scope from what we’re doing here.)\n\nThis extension class means that now we can write the following:\n\n        var words = "One two three four";\n        var wordCount = words.WordCount(); // 4\n\nExtension classes don’t just magicall', 'y apply everywhere, however—they must be brought into scope\nvia the use of the “using” statements, so that if we don’t care to use the MyStringExtensions, the\nWordCount() method won’t appear on String types. And the original class remains unaffected, which\nmeans that the WordCount() extension (like all extensions) cannot have any impact on the internals\nof the extended class—in fact, it can’t see any of the internal members, and so can only ever ', 'be able\nto use the public interface of the extended class. It’s purely compiler syntactic sugar.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  26\n\n\x0cLanguage-INtegrated Query (LINQ)\nAll of this led up to one of the signature moments for the C# compiler with the 3.0 release:\nLanguage-INtegrated Query, or LINQ, for short. To many in the Java community, LINQ represented\neverything that was wrong with Microsoft, accusing them of “embedding SQL into the C# language”\nan', 'd turning C# into a 4GL that was proprietarily bound to SQL Server. As the Jedi Master put it,\n“Amazing—every single part of that sentence is entirely incorrect.” LINQ wasn’t integrating SQL, it\nisn’t about SQL Server, and it’s actually built up around core language principles that had nothing to\ndo with relational databases, much less integrated with SQL Server.\n\nLet’s start by examining a simple collection of Person objects in a list:\n\n        ', 'var people = new List<Person>() {\n            new Person("Ted", "Neward", 45),\n            new Person("Charlotte", "Neward", 39),\n            new Person("Michael", "Neward", 24),\n            new Person("Matthew", "Neward", 18),\n            new Person("Beth", "Massi", 39),\n            new Person("Dustin", "Campbell", 43)\n        };\n\nSuppose I want to give everybody within this list a beer. Sharp readers will notice, of course, that my\nyoungest son', ' is not yet eligible to receive a beer, and this is a family-friendly article, so we don’t want\nto get into trouble with the local authorities.\n\nWere this a discussion of Java8 lambdas, we would talk about using lambdas and streams to filter\nthe collection before applying a higher-order function across each to give each individual a beer.\n(If that’s new to you, Venkat Subramaniam has some great conference lectures online that describe\nJava8 lambd', 'as in more detail.) As far back as C# 3.0, Microsoft saw the need, and chose not only to\nlayer functional principles into the language, but to put a syntax in place that would actually hide the\nfact that this was ever functional programming in the first place:\n\n        var drinkers =\n            from p in people\n            where p.Age > 21\n            select p;\n\nThis is a LINQ query expression, and despite the fact that it looks similar to SQL, ', 'it’s actually invoking\nseveral functional methods in sequence using a fluent interface; translated out of the SQL-like syntax,\nit looks more like:\n\n             drinkers = people.Where((p) => p.Age > 21);\n\nAll of the traditional functional operations are present here—map, filter, and the rest—but they\n“hide” behind this query expression syntax. We’ll talk more about the interesting features and\nimplications of LINQ when we get to Entity Framework', ' in the last section, but for now, just think of\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  27\n\n\x0cLINQ as a syntax that is designed to deliberately bring some of the set-oriented nature of SQL and the\nfunctional-oriented nature of languages such as Haskell into the C# language as a first-class citizen.\n\n(For anybody who really wants to see LINQ taken to an absolute extreme, it can be instructional to\nlook at Luke Hoban’s “single-LINQ-expression-ray-tracer” blog', ' post from 10 years ago, available at\nhttps://aka.ms/linqraytracer. It will send chills down your back, one way or another.)\n\nAsynchronous programming with Async/Await\nC# 4.0 introduced a number of interesting features, but C# 5.0 truly bucked the status quo by\nintroducing language support for a form of asynchronous programming via the “async” and “await”\nkeywords. While not a general-purpose, all-around concurrency feature, async/await added the', '\nability to easily add “little concurrency” into common programming tasks such as issuing a request\nfor a database query or executing a Web API request without having to manually manage the\nthreads necessary to do so without blocking. Leveraging some work done elsewhere on the .NET\nplatform (the Task Parallel Library, or TPL), C# essentially now allows developers to start some work\nand return a Task<T> object, which represents that additional wor', 'k. At the source code level, “async”\ncan decorate either a method signature or an anonymous method literal to indicate it should run\nasynchronously, and “await” tells the compiler to generate the code necessary to hold things in place\nuntil the asynchronous code completes. (Essentially, these are language-level implementations of\n“promises,” which are permeating the JavaScript world and slowly starting to gather steam in the Java\nworld as well, u', 'nder the name “CompletableFuture” out of the java.util.concurrent package in Java8.)\n\nasync Task PlaySongsAsync(int[] ids)\n{\n    foreach (var id in ids)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            var data = await service.GetEncodedDataAsync(id);\n            var song = await Task.Run(() => Decode(data));\n            await PlayAsync(song);\n        }\n        catch (Exception e) { /* just skip the song */ }\n    }\n}\n\nThere is much, much more we can discu', 'ss with respect to C#, but then we’d have no time to talk\nabout anything else, and there is much, much more to go over on our tour. Fortunately, Microsoft has\na great collection of web resources on the language, starting with a page that lists an overall history\nof the language, available at https://aka.ms/csharpwhatsnew, and a general (if abbreviated) overview\nof the language available at https://aka.ms/csharptour. And, of course, there’re books', '. Lots and lots\nof books.\n\nBut once you know how to write code in this language, what can you do with it?\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  28\n\n\x0cFrameworks, for the Win!\n\nBy far and away, the most popular thing to do with C# and the .NET runtime is to build a web\napplication of some form, just as it is with the Java language and runtime. To be sure, the .NET\necosystem supports more than this—one can build desktop applications, mobile applications, and', '\neven games (using the aforementioned Unity framework, among others), but the lion’s share of code\nwritten in C# is web applications.\n\nLike its twin, .NET offers a comprehensive framework of web functionality, ranging all the way\nfrom drag-and-drop-built user interface, to MVC-based server-side rendering, to the construction\nof HTTP-based APIs for invocation by single-page applications written in JavaScript or mobile\napplications. Somewhat confus', 'ingly, however, all three are referred to by the name “ASP.NET.”\n\n(Note to those who recognize the “ASP” moniker from the early days of the Sun/Microsoft rivalry: In\nthe COM days, Microsoft’s web technology was called “Active Server Pages,” ASP for short, named\nafter ActiveX, one of the marketing names for COM. When Microsoft started working on the CLR\ninternally, one of its most important consumers was the ASP team, who sought to create a system', '\nsimilar to JSP to replace ASP. Since the effort was to redo ASP in .NET, the name “ASP.NET” was\ncoined. However, aside from the basic notion that “this is for the web,” there’s little to no relationship\nbetween ASP.NET and its predecessor.)\n\nThe ASP.NET “family” is fundamentally broken into three parts, two of which we’ll examine here (in\nbrief):\n\n•  ASP.NET WebForms, the first flavor of ASP.NET, released with .NET 1.0, featuring drag-and-drop\nu', 'ser interface construction. It was designed to try to bring a VisualBasic-style design philosophy\nto the web, but by .NET 3.0, the Microsoft community had come to understand the design\nadvantages of an MVC-style design approach, and all work on WebForms essentially ceased.\nIronically, about the time that interest in WebForms was ending, the Java community was building\nup JSF, the equivalent to WebForms in Java.\n\n•  ASP.NET MVC: Based on the class', 'ic “Model-View-Controller” principles that the Sun “Model 2”\n\ndesign for servlets and JSP first laid out, Microsoft created ASP.NET MVC, released the source code\nfor it shortly after its initial release, and has considered this to be its first-class server-side web\nframework ever since. ASP.NET MVC was rebranded (and refactored) to be “ASP.NET Core MVC” in\n2015, in keeping with the “.NET Core” naming for the cross-platform runtime, and has made s', 'ome\nconceptual shifts as new frameworks—such as Ruby-on-Rails—gained popularity and created\nsome new patterns (such as routing tables).\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  29\n\n\x0c•  ASP.NET MVC Web API: While the name certainly gets no points for brevity, it does accurately\nreflect the idea that this framework is built off of the same concepts that underlie the ASP.NET\nMVC library, but with the intent of producing JSON data instead of HTML. When ASP.NET M', 'VC was\ntagged with the “Core” moniker, the “MVC” was formally dropped from Web API projects, so that\nnow they are simply “ASP.NET Core Web API,” or more informally, “Web API” projects.\n\nLet’s have a look at a quick ASP.NET Core Web API application—the ubiquitous TODO list—and then\nwe’ll have a quick look at an MVC application before we look at Microsoft’s data-storage framework,\nEntity Framework.\n\nASP.NET Core Web API\nTo get started with Core Web', ' API, we first need to scaffold out the Web API template; this can be\ndone either via “File|New” in one of the Visual Studio IDEs, or from the command-line using the .NET\nCore CLI tools by executing “dotnet new webapi -o todoapi.” This will create a subdirectory called\n“todoapi” and install the .NET Core Web API project inside of it. Out of the box, it scaffolds out a\nsimple API that has one controller to hand back arbitrary “value” objects, acce', 'ssible at\nhttp://localhost:5000/api/values. Before we make any changes to the code, it’s always good to make\nsure the scaffold is working, so execute a “dotnet run” from within the “todoapi” directory, and\nnavigate to the given URL; the response should be a dirt-simple JSON array containing two strings.\n\nA Web API project, like its cousin the MVC application, is broken into models and controllers, with\nthe “view” assumed to be an automated conver', 'sion from a model object into JSON. Thus, in a Web\nAPI project, the goal will be to accept incoming requests, perform the necessary business logic, and\nreturn the appropriate model type, usually corresponding to the resource type in the URL, to be\nconverted to JSON.\n\nThe Controllers directory contains the code for the ValuesController, which is the default-scaffolded\ncode. It doesn’t use any model objects, which means it’s clearly inferior. Let’s', ' delete it, and replace it\nwith something that’s a little more “MV”-like. That means, first of all, that we need a model object to\nrepresent a TODO item, which is a pretty simple domain object:\n\npublic class Todo\n{\n    public long ID { get; set; }\n    public string Description { get; set; }\n    public bool Completed { get; set; }\n\n    public Todo()\n    {\n        Completed = false;\n    }\n}\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  30\n\n\x0c(Note that it would be a', ' bit irregular to call this a POJO, since it’s not a Java object, but that’s basically\nexactly what this is. These are sometimes referred to as Plain Old C# Objects, POCOs, or, less often,\nPlain Old DotNet Objects or PODNOs. Definitely doesn’t roll off the tongue like POJOs, but we do\nwhat we can.)\n\nHaving a domain object, it now remains to build a controller that will respond to the appropriate\nURL (which, by convention, will be prefixed by “/ap', 'i,” but is of course configurable). The Web API\nexpectation is that a controller will be a class that has a number of public methods that obey some\nconventions, in terms of both method names and parameter sets, like Java has done with later\nversions of the Servlet and EJB specifications.\n\n    [Route("api/[controller]")]\n    public class TodosController : Controller\n    {\n        private List<Todo> todos = new List<Todo>() {\n          new Todo() {', ' ID=0, Description="Get milk", Completed=true },\n          new Todo() { ID=1, Description="Get pet food" },\n          new Todo() { ID=2, Description="Learn .NET Core" },\n          new Todo() { ID=3, Description="Write billion-dollar app" }\n        };\n\n        // GET api/todos\n        [HttpGet]\n        public IEnumerable<Todo> Get()\n        {\n            return todos;\n        }\n\n        // GET api/todos/5\n        [HttpGet("{id}")]\n        public T', 'odo Get(int id)\n        {\n            return todos.First((t) => t.ID == id);\n        }\n\n        // POST api/todos\n        [HttpPost]\n        public void Post([FromBody]Todo value)\n        {\n            todos.Add(value);\n        }\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  31\n\n\x0c        // PUT api/todos/5\n        [HttpPut("{id}")]\n        public void Put(int id, [FromBody]Todo value)\n        {\n            var todo = todos.First((t) => t.ID == id);\n            to', 'do.Description = value.Description;\n            todo.Completed = value.Completed;\n        }\n\n        // DELETE api/todos/5\n        [HttpDelete("{id}")]\n        public void Delete(int id)\n        {\n        }\n    }\n\nTo understand this class, it’s important to understand a few things: First, the square-bracketed\ndeclarations outside each method are what .NET calls “custom attributes,” which, true story, figured\nprominently in the design for JSR-175 ', 'annotations. The attributes provide information (via reflection,\nsame way annotations do) about how HTTP verbs should match against the methods—so, for\nexample, the ASP.NET runtime can know that the two Get() methods should both be invoked when\nan incoming GET request is made.\n\nThe other half of that binding, of course, is knowing the partial URL pattern that should trigger the\nmethod. Notice that the controller class itself has an attribute, “Ro', 'uting,” which contains the string\n“api/[controller].” The square-bracketed “controller” is to tell the ASP.NET runtime to use the name\nof the class, minus its “-Controller” suffix, so the URL pattern for all of these API endpoints is “api/\ntodos.” From here, standard REST conventions kick in—a GET to “api/todos” should return all of the\nTODO items, so the Get() method taking no parameters and returning an IEnumerable<Todo> (think\nof it as a high-', 'level iterator interface) is the right one to invoke here. If, on the other hand, a caller\nwants a single TODO, they’ll issue a request with a URL pattern of “api/todos/” plus the ID of the\nTODO requested. The second Get() method indicates that the URL pattern includes “{id},” so “api/\ntodos/3” will extract “3” and pass it for the value of “id” to the method. Ditto for the Put and Delete\nmethods.\n\nThe full details of routing are in the ASP.NET do', 'cumentation, but this should be sufficient to\nunderstand what’s happening here. To see the new controller in action, just do a “dotnet run” from\nthe “todoapi” directory, and point an HTTP client (curl or Postman) at http://localhost:5000/api/todos\nto see the JSON representations handed back.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  32\n\n\x0cASP.NET Core MVC\nHTTP-based APIs are nice, but when we need a traditional server-side rendered application, ASP.NET\nprovide', 's a traditional MVC framework called (not surprisingly) ASP.NET Core MVC. It’s the same MVC\nwe find in most modern web frameworks; views are rendered using a particular template syntax,\ncalled “Razor” (or “Razor pages”) that is designed to be expressive yet terse. It’s a syntax inspired\nfrom other similar frameworks, particularly JSP and Ruby-on-Rails, but also tried to be reasonably\nfamiliar to generations of ASP and ASP.NET WebForms developers.', ' Controllers look almost the same\nas they do in the API scenario, and models, of course, are just C# classes representing the domain.\n\nRazor templates use a .cshtml extension, and like JSP, they use different syntax to indicate which\nparts of the page are to be interpreted in a code-aware manner, as opposed to being taken literally\nas output format. Razor syntax uses the “@” symbol to set off code blocks or other processing\nstatements in several ', 'different ways; for example, to do a simple “for” loop within a page, Razor uses\nan “@for” to set off the loop. Unlike JSP, however, the Razor syntax is clear enough that there isn’t a\nneed to require explicit symbols to set off between code and HTML output:\n\n<h2>Welcome</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    @for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)\n    {\n        <li>Beetlejuice</li>\n    }\n</ul>\n\nViews, of course, can make use of objects and data provided by a controller, often by ', 'making use\nof a predefined key-value map called ViewData. If we want the message and the number of times\nit should be printed to be set up by a controller (perhaps the controller is obtaining it from HTML\nquery parameters or a database), then the controller can set those by using the keys “Message” and\n“NumTimes” in the ViewData dictionary, respectively. The view can then display them like this:\n\n<h2>Welcome</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    @for (int i = 0; i < (i', 'nt)ViewData["NumTimes"]; i++)\n    {\n        <li>@ViewData["Message"]</li>\n    }\n</ul>\n\nIn essence, ViewData is the ASP.NET equivalent to Servlet “request” scope.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  33\n\n\x0cThe controller perspective that drives this looks remarkably similar to what a servlet controller would\ndo, with a few differences:\n\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\nusing System.Text.Encodings.Web;\n\nnamespace MvcMovie.Controllers\n{\n    public class Hello', 'WorldController : Controller\n    {\n        public IActionResult Welcome(string name, int numTimes = 1)\n        {\n            ViewData["Message"] = "Hello " + name;\n            ViewData["NumTimes"] = numTimes;\n\n            return View();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that the Welcome method takes two parameters, which will be filled in from HTML query\nparameters, fills in the ViewData dictionary, and then calls “View,” which then looks for a Razor pag', 'e\nfile whose name matches that of the method—in this case, it will be looking for “Welcome.cshtml.”\nASP.NET Core MVC has a number of ways to adjust and change these conventions, but out of the\nbox, the convention-based approach makes it simpler and easier than the configuration descriptor\napproach of older Servlet versions.\n\nASP.NET Core MVC obviously consists of a great deal more than just what we’ve discussed here, but\nthe underlying message sh', 'ould be clear: ASP.NET Core (both the MVC and the Web API versions)\nlearned a great deal from its contemporaries, including those in the Servlet world (JSP, the Play\nframework, and more), and as such, it will be very straightforward for a Java developer to pick up and\nexplore.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into the code above, consider having a look into this tutorial:\nhttps://aka.ms/first-web-api.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  34\n\n\x0cEntit', 'y Framework Core\nOf course, being able to access the server and pass JSON back and forth is only half the story; the\nother half is taking that data and storing it. Or rather, storing it, indexing it, searching it, collating\nit, sorting it, drawing pretty graphs with it, and more. When working with a relational database,\nthe technology Microsoft offers its .NET constituents is called Entity Framework, or EF, and in many\nrespects it works like any ', 'other object/relational mapping framework does. Thanks to some of the\nlanguage features in C#, however, in many cases working with EF is actually easier than working with\nJPA or Hibernate.\n\nLike much in the .NET universe, Entity Framework is undergoing a bit of a reshuffle; what used to\nbe a closed, proprietary source base is now open, and as EF was opened to the world, the project\nowners thought a (slight) rebrand seemed appropriate. As a result', ', the open-source version of EF is\ncalled “Entity Framework Core,” and to begin using it, we need to install it into the project via NuGet,\neither by using the Package Manager in Visual Studio, or by using the command-line for .NET Core by\nentering:\n\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\n\nThis is, of course, assuming we are using SQLServer—since not everybody uses SQL Server, however,\na number of different EF database provide', 'rs are available, including MySQL, Postgres, SQLite,\nFirebase, and a few more. (Third-party vendors are constantly introducing new ones, in a manner\nsimilar to the JDBC driver ecosystem, so bear in mind that Microsoft may not even know all the EF\nproviders in the world.)\n\nThere’re a few “management” tasks that will be easier to do from the command-line, and EF has a\ncommand-line package that installs “inside” the standard .NET Core command-line t', 'ool, but as of this\nwriting, making use of it requires adding a line by hand to the project’s .csproj file:\n\n<ItemGroup>\n  <DotNetCliToolReference\n     Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet"\n     Version="2.0.0" />\n</ItemGroup>\n\nIn addition, the EF Core command-ling tooling requires another dependent package:\n\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design\n\nAt this point, EF should be installed and ready to go. More detaile', 'd instructions can be found on the\nMicrosoft docs site at https://aka.ms/ef-install.\n\nFundamentally, the most critical element to using EF from a project is the DbContext. This is a class\nfrom which a project will create a derived class that represents the “context” for this project against\nthe database—it will be a repository, session, and gateway, all rolled into one. Like many object/\nrelational tools, it also provides some core behavior, incl', 'uding some migration capabilities (database\nversioning).\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  35\n\n\x0cLike Hibernate or JPA, EF uses classes to represent entities in the database, and these classes are\noften referred to as “model” objects, since they typically serve that purpose in an MVC and/or Web\nAPI application. These will usually look like “plain old C# objects,” with the odd custom attribute to\nhelp give EF some additional hints about how to map to th', 'e database table they represent.\n\nFor example, if the application is a blog, then we will want classes representing a blog, and blog\npost, representing a single blog entry. But there’s also some blog metadata we might want to track\nthat wouldn’t be appropriate to store in the database (such as whether the blog was stored in the\ndatabase), which we will want Entity Framework to ignore entirely. One way to do this is to use a\ncustom attribute, or t', 'he EF Fluent API can indicate that the blog metadata class should be ignored\nusing the “OnModelCreating” method, invoked when the database schema is created.\n\npublic class BloggingContext : DbContext\n{\n    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }\n\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n    {\n        modelBuilder.Ignore<BlogMetadata>();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Blog\n{\n    public int BlogId { get; set; }\n    public string', ' Url { get; set; }\n\n    public List<Post> Posts { get; set; }\n\n    public BlogMetadata Metadata { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Post\n{\n    public int PostId { get; set; }\n    public string Title { get; set; }\n    public string Content { get; set; }\n\n    public Blog Blog { get; set; }\n}\npublic class BlogMetadata\n{\n    public DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; }\n}\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  36\n\n\x0cThe “Id” fields, of course, are typically primar', 'y key integer columns in the database, and the List\nof Posts is a classic one-to-many relationship. All of this will be eminently familiar to any user of\nHibernate, JPA, or other object-relational modeling system. What will be different will be the way in\nwhich queries and modifiers are run; thanks to LINQ, Entity Framework uses an entirely new style of\nquery starting from the DbSet fields modeled on the DbContext-inheriting class. To do a query ', 'to\nfetch all the blogs from the system, we simply create an instance of the context inside of a “using”\nblock (which is the inspiration for the try-with-resources block in Java7), and use that instance to\nobtain the set of Blog instances and iterate through them:\n\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext())\n{\n    foreach (var blog in context.Blogs) {\n        // do something with the blog\n    }\n}\n\nContrary to what we experienced during the heyday ', 'of EJB Entity Beans, however, this isn’t a case\nof early loading or late loading; under the hood, Entity Framework is making use of “enumerator\nobjects” (very similar to Java8 streams and the Java Iterable<T> interface) to fetch objects in batches,\njust as a typical database cursor would do.\n\nIn the Java world, however, filtering that list of blogs to include only those that have “dotnet” in\nthe URL presented problems—either the filtering happens', ' on the database side, in which case the\nquery has to be translated to SQL, or the filtering happens on the client side, which means the entire\ncollection has to be brought over the network. With LINQ, however, this looks like this:\n\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext())\n{\n    foreach (var blog in context.Blogs\n        .Where(b => b.Url.Contains("dotnet"))) {\n        // do something with the blog\n    }\n}\n\nBut this has the same drawbacks as ', 'before; instead, we can use an “expression tree,” a feature of\nLINQ that compiles into a runtime structure that reflects the compiled code:\n\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext())\n{\n    var allDotnetBlogUrls = from blog in context.Blogs\n        where blog.Url.Contains("dotnet")\n        select blog.Url;\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  37\n\n\x0c    foreach (var url in allDotnetBlogUrls) {\n        // do something with the blog URL\n        // note we d', "on't have the entire Blog, just the Url\n    }\n}\n\nThis “from-where-select” syntax that looks so much like SQL isn’t; it’s a syntax that’s designed to look\nsimilar to SQL and offer many of the same kinds of operators and options. However, this isn’t an SQL\nquery—it will not be sent to the database. Instead, the expression tree is analyzed—and optimized—\nby the EF plumbing to generate an efficient SQL statement, on a driver-by-driver basis. This mea", 'ns\nthat the query filters and restrictions are analyzed on the client side, but sent to the database to be\nexecuted—for example, the above turns into a “SELECT url FROM blog WHERE…” using whatever\nprimitives to do a string-containment check that the database and EF provider offers. This is really\nthe best-of-both-worlds scenario. Couple that with the compile-time type checking that the C#\ncompiler provides against the model objects, and you have ', 'a solution that is entirely new to the Java\nworld. (Not impossible to provide, mind you, but still something the Java world currently lacks.)\n\nUpdates and modifications entail making modifications on the model object, and those changes\nwill be sent to the database when the context object goes out of the using block’s scope. To add\na new blog, construct the object and add it to the DbSet on the context object; to remove it, use\nthe context’s DbSet', ' again. And should you really, really want to write raw SQL, the context object\nprovides that capacity.\n\nThere is, of course, much more to discuss about Entity Framework—it’s every bit as rich and powerful\nas JPA, and as such, definitely larger than just what we can cover in a single paper. For more examples\nof LINQ syntax, check out https://aka.ms/101LinqSamples. For 101 LINQ samples, and for more\ninformation on Entity Framework itself, head ove', 'r to the EF documentation home at https://docs.\nmicrosoft.com/ef/core/.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  38\n\n\x0cWrapping Up\n\nTo suggest that this is somehow the end of the story is ludicrous. The .NET ecosystem holds a rich\ntapestry of open-source projects and commercial tools and frameworks, and that means that a\ndeveloper could, if they wished, spend their entire career just discovering the boundaries there. We\nhaven’t even begun to discuss the alter', 'native languages for the .NET platform, either from Microsoft\n(F#, an object/functional hybrid that fills the same role as Scala, or good old Visual Basic, one of the\noriginal dynamic languages) or from the community (check out Boo, a Python-inspired dynamic\nlanguage). We haven’t begun to explore the different open-source frameworks that do dependency\ninjection. We haven’t begun to explore the different frameworks for doing unit testing, or the o', 'nline\ntooling from Microsoft to provide agile project support. We haven’t even mentioned Azure.\n\nThis is a brave new land, intrepid adventurer, but rest easy: Much of what you know from your time\nin the world of Java will serve you well here. The concepts are similar, but different enough to be\ninteresting. The platforms are powerful, and the communities open and inviting. The tools are easily\nobtained, and the tutorials plenty. You might even re', 'cognize a few familiar names, those who have\ncome before you across the pond and gone on this adventure before you. Be the tourist, if you like,\nbut know that there’s plenty of room to build your own home and settle down here, even if it’s only a\nsummer home. Come in, and be welcome.\n\nAnd, unlike a certain young boy on his first trip to France, you won’t have to worry about somebody’s\nfather trying to convince you that “escargot” is French for “t', 'ater tots.”\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n  39\n\n']
