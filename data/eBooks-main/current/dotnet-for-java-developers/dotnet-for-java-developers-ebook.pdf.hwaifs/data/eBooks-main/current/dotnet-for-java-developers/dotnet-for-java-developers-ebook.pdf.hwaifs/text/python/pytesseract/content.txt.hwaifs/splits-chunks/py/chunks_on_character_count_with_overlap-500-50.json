It was our first\ntrip out of the country, and aside from the ridiculously long flight\u2014eight hours on an airplane feels\nlike forever to somebody who hasn't yet finished their first decade of life\u2014I really had no idea of\nwhat to expect.", " In fact, in an amusing anecdote my father has yet to tire of telling, I remember having\nto sit down with my parents in front of a globe so that they could explain to me that \u201cthe United\nStates\u201d was not, in fact, synonymous with \u201cthe world.\u201d\n\nIt was entirely a trip of firsts: my first experience wandering around in a world where I couldn't\nunderstand any of the written signs, my first experience eating food I couldn't recognize, and my\nfirst expe", "rience feeling completely lost in the world around me. I found, to my eight-year-old horror,\nthat I couldn't even figure out which bathroom to use\u2014which, considering I had just the year before\nmanaged to convince my mother I didn't need to be escorted to the bathroom and back, was of\nparticular concern. I didn't want her to start thinking I actually needed adult supervision. This was\nclearly not my home, and I was more than a little terrified of ", "it.\n\nVisiting a foreign land, particularly to someone who has cocooned themselves entirely in the\nconcepts and cultures of \u201chome,\u201d can be intimidating and overwhelming without a guide. On that trip\nto France I had my parents, and despite neither of them speaking anything close to fluent French,\nthey managed to guide us through the tricky parts. (French-English guidebooks are a wonderful\nthing.)\n\nFor the typical Java developer, finding a guide to ", "exploring the .NET ecosystem can be tricky, since\nthe average Java developer can still hearken back to a time when expressing an interest in looking at\n.NET was tantamount to declaring a desire to betray everything good and right in the world (or so it\nseemed, at least at the time).\n\nIn this paper, I will serve as your guide to the .NET world. I've been a part of the .NET ecosystem\nalmost as long as I've been a part of Java's. I started with Java", " in 1996; I started with what would\nbecome .NET in 2000, even before it was announced. I've built applications in both, written books\nfor both, and explored the source for both. They're closer to one another than you might think, but\neach has been fundamentally influenced by the people using them. In fact, it's not a bad analogy to\nthink of them as twin brothers, separated at birth, raised by different sets of parents. Same DNA, but\nshaped by the", "ir experiences and events to be different in a number of interesting places.\n\nIf you're a Java developer, looking to get started exploring the .NET ecosystem, then suspend what\nyou think you know, take my hand, and let's take a trip to a foreign land. Doing so will require a little\nhistory to understand how things came to be, then a quick set of instructions on how to get the\ntooling set up (and which tooling you want, depending on your preferenc", "es). Once the environment\nis set up, we can pick up the critical differences between C# and Java, and start diving into some\n\nof the central frameworks in this world\u2014ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and a few others. When we\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nfinish up, if you're following along, you'll have everything you need to start your own exploration of\nthe .NET community, and from there you'll get to draw your own conclusions and make your own\nopinions", ".\n\nMost importantly, you'll know how to order off the menu and tell the bathrooms apart.\n\nReady?\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nHistory\n\nIf you'd like to skip the walk down memory lane, you can jump to the next section, Getting Started.\n\nOstensibly, the history of .NET begins in October of 2000, at Microsoft's Professional Developer\nConference (PDC), when Microsoft announced to the world that they were working on a new\nprogramming platform, on which ", "would rest the fate of all Microsoft development to follow. It was\ncalled .NET, it would be the backbone for their upcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would\nbe a part of their data management system (nicknamed \u201cSQLServer.NET\u201c), and it would form the\ncore development platform for building interconnected applications into the future by leveraging\nemerging standards such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few others the world had not yet really com", "e to\nunderstand. It would be the principal competitor platform to their principal development rival at the\ntime, Sun Microsystems, and its Java platform. And the world could see that the shot was fired, the\nline in the sand drawn, and the armies drawn up; clearly, this was Microsoft copying the efforts of its\ncompetitors, seeking dominance, and.....\n\nAnd most of the world completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it had come to\nexist", ", and what Microsoft really sought to obtain from it.\n\nIn fact, it's fair to suggest that many within the Microsoft ecosystem misunderstood what .NET was\nreally about; once announced, the marketing machine took over. Much effort was wasted due to the\nentanglement of \u201cNET\u201d with \u201cweb services,\u201d and it would take the better part of a decade before\npeople could understand that the two really had nothing intrinsically to do with one another any\nmore t", "han \u201cPerl\u201d did with \u201cdatabases.\u201d Microsoft management compounded all this confusion by\nre-branding the \u201c.NET\u201d suffix to a number of their products, which they later corrected but well after\nthe damage had been done.\n\nBut despite all that, solid engineering rests at the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made\nit harder to see, but it\u2019s always been there. To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its\nproper historical conte", "xt: that, in truth, it was the simple \u201cnext step\u201d along an evolutionary chain that\nstretched back much further than that October keynote almost two decades ago.\n\nOf components, managed environments, and code\n\nIn the beginning, there was C.\n\nTo be more accurate about it, in the beginning a number of programming languages were created\n\nto make it easier to produce programs that knew how to execute on a single chip. They integrated\ndirectly with the", " hardware, making use of the facilities there to obtain memory, interact with the\n\ndisk, and present data to the display for the user to understand. In time, we as an industry found that\nthis direct-hardware interaction had its drawbacks, and we sought to create a series of abstractions\non top of that hardware, to help coordinate the use of the hardware across multiple simultaneously\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nexecuting programs. We called that f", "irst attempt at regulating and managing the hardware an\noperating system. And it was pretty good. So good, in fact, that numerous flavors of operating\nsystem were born, including Microsoft's Windows operating system, and Solaris, and macOS (though\nit was called \u201cSystem 7\u201d back then), and Linux, and a few others whose names exist now only in the\nhistory books and dusty corners of Usenet forums. (Bonus points if you recognize these names:\nMinix, Ma", "ch, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even more bonus points if you ever ran one of them. If you\never ran DOS, though, it just means you're old.)\n\nThe bigger, more important issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system\nitself\u2014that programmers found it helpful and useful to have \u201csomething else\u201d working with their\nprograms. That \u201csomething else\u201d would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs\nexecuted and behaved, ", "rather than assuming that every single nuance had to be the programmers\u2019\nresponsibility.\n\nThis concept, in large, is essentially that of a \u201cmanaged environment.\u201d Although it has its roots\n\nin operating systems, it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of\ncontainers and cloud: that there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are\nresponsible for details that the programmer doesn't want to have t", "o deal with. Operating systems\nare managed environments in that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to\nschedule the execution of threads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network\nports or data files. Virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in\nthat they regulate the access and reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode\nformat into CPU-native ins", "tructions, and prevent the direct access of memory (except under very\nspecific circumstances) in order to avoid process termination by careless programming. Containers\nsuch as Docker are managed environments in that they provide a context around an executable\n\nto mimic a precise environment\u2014configuration files, environment variables, and shared network\nsettings\u2014so that developers can be assured that the environment outside their programs are\ncons", "istent regardless of where they are deployed.\n\nBy the early \u201890s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for\nWindows developers to be able to take \u201cthe next step forward\u201d in development evolution. The \u201cGUI\nrevolution\u201d of the mid-'80s was largely finished; programs weren't just about \u201cdialogs and data,\u201d\nbut now needed to integrate more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for\nexample) and start t", "aking advantage of networking in greater detail. (Old developers like me will\nremember that it was around 1995 that references to HTTP and \u201cthe World Wide Web\u201d were just\nstarting to appear in publications and technology journals.)\n\nAs is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges emerged. C++ developers\nhad been speaking of \u201creusable code\u201d for several years, but it was Visual Basic (and Delphi, along with\nseveral other \u201c4GL\u201d vari", "ants) that demonstrated actual practical code reuse, in the form of \u201ccontrols\u201d:\nwidgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly without requiring in-depth\nknowledge about the controls\u2019 implementation. Simply obtain the library, put it into the right place\nwithin the development environment, drag-and-drop the control into the construction area, and lo,\nthe developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of \u201cappl", "ication frameworks,\u201d\nlike MFC and OWL, but \u201cGUI builders\u201d had demonstrated that the concept of \u201ccontrols\u201d could be\nleveraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and events; now\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nMicrosoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the bigger world beyond GUI development.\nMore importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship\u2014make it possible for outside\ndevelopers to build \u201c", "things\u201d that could be used by existing things (such as the operating system or,\nperhaps, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their implementation.\n\nTo do that, they needed to create a managed environment that would work across a variety of\ndifferent languages, but all operating under the same rules. That effort, called the Component\nObject Model (COM), was the first of several \u201cmanaged platforms\u201d that emerged during the early-\nand mid-", "'90s. (Ironically, several open-source efforts would go after this same space many years\nafter Microsoft declared COM \u201cfinished,\u201d including Mozilla's XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in\nthat it became the backbone of Windows development for a significant percentage of the Windows\nplatform. But it still failed in that it left programs vulnerable to many of the same things that had\nplagued them before: memory leaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpe", "cted process termination at\nthe first mistake. It was clear that, despite the managed platform, writing code in a \u201cnative\u201d language\n(such as C/C++ or Delphi) still wasn\u2019t a particularly great place to be.\n\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that Sun Microsystems demonstrated the HotJava browser\nto the world, the centerpiece of which was this language that could be used to write executable\n\nbits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft ", "had come to the realization that this was what it\nwas missing: a \u201cmanaged language\u201d to run on top of their managed platform. A managed language\nhad exactly the right \u201cdistance\u201d from the underlying operating system they were seeking\u2014garbage\ncollection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashes, and the virtual machine could\nhelp enforce stronger security controls that the world had just started to realize they needed. It was,\nin many w", "ays, a perfect match. Microsoft invested resources into building their own JVM, extended\ntheir IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrated COM into the runtime.\n\nUnfortunately, in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own destruction.\n\nHello, .NET\n\nDivorces are never a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one is always fraught with opinion,\nrevisionist history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997", "/1998, two facts were becoming clear:\none, Sun didn't care for Microsoft's work increasing interoperability between their JVM and native\nCOM components in Windows}, and two, Microsoft and Java were going to part ways, one way or\nanother. (Who got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)\n\nEither certain groups within Microsoft could see the writing on the wall or they had come to find\nissues (real or perceived) with the Java Virtual Machine; ei", "ther way, by 1998, a new effort came to\nlife inside of Microsoft, designed to bring a new managed platform and managed language into the\nworld. Originally intended as the successor to COM, it went through a variety of names, including\n\n1 For the curious, Microsoft offered additional platform-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with native\nCOM components. The irony of this is deep, considering that Sun had actually allowed for COM-specific", "\nnative interfaces in their JNI specification\u2014the first three methods in the interface table for a JNIEnv (\u201cJNI\nenvironment\u201d) object were specifically left \u201creserved\u201d for the necessary three methods (AddRef, Release, and\nQuerylInterface) of every COM interface object. Those three slots are still reserved to this day.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n\u201cCOM+,\" the \u201cComponent Object Runtime\u201d (COR), the \u201cUniversal RunTime\u201d (URT), and \u201cNext-\nGeneration Windo", "ws Services\u201d (NGWS) before finally being introduced to the world as \u201c.NET\u201d at that\nOctober 2000 PDC. Along with it would come a new language, code-named \u201cCOOL\u201d (supposedly\n\nto stand for the \u201cComponent-Oriented Object Language,\u201d although opinions vary now) and later\nrenamed \u201cC#.\"\n\nWhile most observers considered C# and the CLR (the Common Language Runtime, the virtual\nmachine executing the bytecode) to be direct competitors of Java, Microsoft took", " careful steps to\nensure that it was \u201copen\u201d in ways that Java was not: where the JVM was designed from the beginning\nto be a virtual machine for a single language, the CLR embraced a more polyglot approach, with\nMicrosoft even going so far as to recruit several universities and companies to create new languages\nfor this platform and/or adapt existing ones. This project, nicknamed \u201cProject 7\u201d (for the 7 groups\nthat participated), debuted several o", "f these languages during .NET's introduction, and included CLR\nflavors of Eiffel, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of these languages gained any traction after the first\nfew years of existence, and most no longer exist, but their presence had the effect on Microsoft of\n\u201ckeeping them honest\u201d with respect to other languages beyond C# and Visual Basic as the platform\ngrew and evolved. (Microsoft itself would later go on to introduce a number of new CLR-", "based\nlanguages, including a compiled-to-binary version of ECMAScript, two different efforts at bringing\nmanaged coding to C++, a hybrid object/functional language called F#, and several more research\nlanguages.)\n\nHowever, Microsoft also sought to make sure that .NET was not a proprietary effort by investing\nthousands of man-hours into the creation of a series of international specifications\u2014through the\nEuropean Computer Manufacturer's Associatio", "n (ECMA\u2019)\u2014to ensure that C# and the underlying\nplatform were both open industry standards. C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and the\nunderlying runtime was given the name the \u201cCommon Language Infrastructure\u201d (CLI), and accepted\nand ratified as ECMA-335. Intel, HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in\nkeeping these specifications up to date with changes to the language and the platform, the most\nrecent updates\u00ae comin", "g in 2012 for the CLI and 2017 for C#.\n\nWith the introduction of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpected side-effect: members of\nthe open-source community began to examine building a \u201cclean-room\u201d implementation of them.\nWhile the CLI Specification didn't include any of the Windows-specific features (such as a deep COM\nintegration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution for their existing\ndeveloper base, the CL", "I Specification itself provided enough integration points to make it interesting\nto implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one such project, calling\nit Mono.\n\nThe specification also gave Microsoft some room to do what some within the company had been\nlooking to do for quite a while: provide a research and experimentation vehicle for the academic and\nresearch communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripp", "ed-down version of the CLR\nsource code, code-named \u201cRotor,\u201d distributed under an open-source license they created, called the\n\n2 ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification for the language commonly known as \u201cJavaScript,\u201d but is\nmore rightly called \u201cECMAScript,\u201d governed as ECMA-262.\n\n> CLI: https://www.iso.org/standard/58046.html and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/\nEcma-335.htm; C#: http://www.ecma-internation", "al.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n\u201cShared Source\u201d license, giving it the formal name \u201cShared Source CLI\u201d or \u201cSSCLI.\"\u201d While Mono would\nremain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, and Rotor of even less interest to\nthose outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source mindset were sown. Over time, Mono\nwould be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own company, Xamarin, whic", "h would faithfully\nparallel the work described by the specifications and periodically try out new ideas for the open-\nsource community to consider.\n\nMicrosoft officially released the first version of C# and the CLR in 2002, and new versions came\nroughly three years apart after that: C# 2.0 in 2005, and C# 3.0 in 2008. Each was contained ina\nproduct release of Visual Studio, such that C# 2.0 and version 2.0 of the CLR runtime was released\nwith Vis", "ual Studio 2005, and C# 3.0 and CLR 3.5 came with Visual Studio 2008. Microsoft then shifted\nto a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, and most\nrecently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the versions of C# and the CLR started falling out of lockstep\nwith Visual Studio, deliberately, for a couple of reasons.\n\nThe first was that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, and was st", "arting to\nunbundle its various parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independent, parts. F#, which\nfirst shipped \u201cout of the box\u201d in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to start down the open-\nsource path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project, it had never really\nembraced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place. Microsoft started\nworking shortly thereafter on an open-", "source rewrite of its entire compiler toolchain, code-named\n\u201cRoslyn.\u201d By the time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem were starting to ship\nindependently, with Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for developers to gather the parts\nof the ecosystem they desired more easily. Open-source package management (called NuGet), which\nbegan life well outside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated into Visual St", "udio so that\nNuGet came \u201cout of the box,\u201d much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java IDEs.\n\nMono, meanwhile, had started to gain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular, the\ngaming toolkit Unity had expressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running\ninside the Unity toolkit. Unity-based games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the\nJavaScript-on-.NET implementation that Microsoft had done back", " in 2001), C#, or even a Python-\ninspired .NET language called Boo. Additionally, the open-source community produced another .NET\nimplementation, the .NET Micro Framework, specifically aimed at embedded software systems and\nsmall-scale hardware such as the Arduino platform.\n\nAll of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, Microsoft announced that the source\n\nfor ASP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to anyone who ", "wanted to look at it. It\nwasn't full open-source yet, though, in that they weren't accepting pull requests. It was, however,\n\nan important step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It announced that it would completely\nopen-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making it available to any platform and accept\npull requests from any developer so inclined. A new .NET implementation would be completely\nopen-source and hosted on Gi", "tHub, called .NET Core. It also announced the creation of the .NET\nFoundation, an industry consortium of groups dedicated to the growth of the .NET platform, in\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nmuch the same fashion that the Java Community Process governs the continued growth of the Java\nplatform\u2019.\n\nTo be sure, Microsoft made some missteps along the way, and definitely learned a few hard lessons\nabout its relationship with the open-source community, bu", "t by late 2017, Microsoft was statistically\nthe biggest contributor on GitHub (measured in terms of total numbers of contributors\u2019), and all\n\nof its key components\u2014language, runtime, libraries, and many of its tools\u2014were available for\ndownload on GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft also started to get more serious about the cross-platform/portability aspects of the .NET\necosystem. Xamarin, which by 2009 had started producing tools that could cross-compile .NET\nby", "tecode into native applications for iOS and Android platforms (the catchy-named \u201cMonoDroid\u201d\nand less-catchy \u201cMono for iOS\u201d toolkits), was flourishing, and Microsoft realized that a practical story\nfor being able to share non-UI portions of code across multiple platforms was necessary if they\nwanted to avoid developer confusion.\n\nWhile the ECMA Specifications had discussed different \u201cprofiles\u201d for levels of .NET standardization,\nthese profiles wer", "e in many ways similar to their \u201cJava Standard Edition,\" \u201cJava Micro Edition,\u201d and\n\u201cJava Enterprise Edition\u201d cousins\u2014a little unwieldy in a number of ways, but most notably in that\nthere wasn't really a good way to guarantee compatibility across platforms and implementation\nversions\u2014if code is compiled by the Java6 compiler, it is safe to assume that it will continue to run on\nthe Java6 virtual machine from whence it was compiled, but the Java AP", "Is do change from release to\nrelease, and this has tripped up the unwary Java developer from time to time.\n\nThus, in 2016, Microsoft announced the \u201c.NET Standard 1.0\u201d profile, a collection not of relatively\nvague implementation documents, but an actual API standard, such that a developer who sought\n\nto build a library that could be used by a variety of different platforms (across a certain number of\nversions of that platform, even) could know tha", "t anything that implemented .NET Standard 1.0 would\nbe able to consume that library, regardless of where that code is running\u2014on a web server, on a\nmobile device, or even on somebody's VR helmet (running a 3D interactive application written with\nUnity).\n\nWhich brings us, now, to the current day.\n\n\u201cTronically, Microsoft's move to the .NET Foundation comes at the same time Oracle is looking to move\naway from the JCP; both companies have experience ", "with standards organizations, and neither wants to see\ninnovation stifled in committee.\n\n> http://www. businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-open-source-2016-9\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nHello, strange new world\n\nTo the Java developer, this is a strange, strange world compared to the one they glimpsed into back\nin 2000.\n\nFor starters, the Java world looks wildly different than it once did.

Or that it was once \u201ca thing\u201d?

A new player, to be sure, and still finding its feet in a variety of\nways, but one committed to the open-source community. In addition to the strides it has made with\n.NET, Microsoft has opened Azure up to almost every mainstream language and platform\u2014including\nJava. (Yes, you can run Tomcat and MySQL in an Azure cloud cluster.) SQL Server has been ported\n\nto Linux. Windows Server can be loaded into a Docker cont", "ainer, and Microsoft works with the\nDocker community to bring Docker-on-Windows up to the same level of sublime that it has on other\nplatforms.\n\nWithin the .NET ecosystem, the .NET Standard, now at a 2.0 release, provides an umbrella of\nguaranteed compatibility across three major platforms of this writing: the Windows-based .NET\nFramework (which contains the necessary libraries for building Windows client applications, for\nexample), .NET Core (in", "tended for the cross-platform server world, including Docker containers\nand cloud-native targets), and Xamarin (principally aimed at the iOS and Android world, but also\nproviding bindings for building macOS applications). Unity has joined the .NET Foundation and\nexpects to be aligned with the various versions of .NET Standard by mid-2018.\n\nAll of which means that it\u2019s not a bad time to start exploring this world in more depth.\n\n.NET for Java Deve", "lopers\n\nGetting Started: Tooling\n\nGetting started with .NET depends pretty heavily on your choice of operating system and, to a lesser\ndegree, the development experience you want.

While Microsoft is working to get the .NET\nCore packages into the standard Ubuntu distribution channels, at the time of this writing that hasn't\nhappened completely, so Ubuntu users will need to add Microsoft's key and Ubuntu-release-specific\nURL into the list of sources the Ubuntu apt-get utilities check for packages.

If you've been\ndoing a lot of web f", "ront-end work, you may already have been using it. In many ways, it's the latest\nattempt at building an \u201ceditor-plus-plug-ins\u201d tool, and it is gaining some traction with the world\noutside the Microsoft ecosystem.

Probably the most useful things are the button-\nlinks to \u201cGet Started\u201d and \u201cDownload\u201d, the latter takes you to a collection of different download\nlinks, and the former takes you to a series of tutorial steps to getting started building a console\n\u201cHelloWorld\u201d application. (Sounds familiar, no?)\n\nHello, dotnet: CLI style\n\nRegardless of how", " you've got the command-line tooling on your machine, it all boils down to one\nthing: The machine has a command-line tool called \u201cdotnet\u201d that\u2019s in the PATH and hooked up to an\nInternet connection. Away we go.\n\nThe \u201cdotnet\u201d tool, in many ways, is a re-examination of the thought process that Maven brought into\nthe world: a command-line tool that can generate out a project based on customizable/extensible\ntemplates stored in the cloud, as well as a", "ct as a single point-of-control for building, running,\ntesting, and any other commands that need to happen to a given project. The \u201cdotnet\u201d tool hides a\nfair amount of .NET Core\u2019s machinery, in the same way that Maven hides a fair amount of the Java\nmachinery (CLASSPATH references, for example), so keep in mind that we're only looking at the tip of\nthe iceberg as we work with this. (Make no mistake\u2014the tooling here goes just as deep and just as\nw", "ide as anything we've ever used in the Java world, and it\u2019s just as easy to get lost in it if we dive too\ndeeply into it too quickly.)\n\nTo start a .NET Core application, we can use \u201cdotnet\u201d to generate a project based on the \u201cconsole\u201d\napplication template, like so:\n\n$ dotnet new console -o HelloWorld\n\nThis will generate a \u201cconsole\u201d project into the directory \u201cHelloWorld\u201d; for those who are curious,\n\u201cdotnet new\u201d by itself, or \u201cdotnet new --list,\u201d ", "will list all of the project templates that the \u201cdotnet\u201d\ncommand knows about. Out of the box, it has about a dozen or so project templates, including\nconsole applications, class libraries, a half-dozen flavors of web projects, and so on. This list is\nexpected to grow and evolve as time goes on, just as the list of Maven archetypes grew after its\nrelease. Note that the list also allows generation of projects across different languages, so those wh", "o\nreally want to sneak a peek at what an F# Web API project would look like can run:\n\n$ dotnet new webapi -o HelloFSAPI -lang F#\n\nASP.NET Web API will be discussed in a little more detail later in this paper; however interesting,\nthough, F# is not something we're going to explore here. You can learn more at fsharp.org.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nImplicit in the \u201cnew\u201d command is a request to download all of the dependencies that a project\nrequires", ", which in \u201cdotnet\u201d parlance is a command to \u201crestore.\u201d This requests all of the dependent\nassemblies\u2014JAR file equivalents, essentially\u2014from a Maven-like, cloud-based service called\nNuGet. NuGet was heavily inspired by Maven and Ruby gems, which means, for the most part, it\nworks the same way Maven does\u2014when doing a \u201cdotnet restore,\u201d the machine must be connected\nto the Internet, and depending on the size of the project, could take a while to dow", "nload all the\ndependencies.\n\nOnce the project has been \u201crestore\u2019d, all of the dependencies are downloaded, and the application\ncan be run by using \u201cdotnet run\u201d from within the project directory. This will, not surprisingly, print\n\u201cHello World!\u201d to the terminal. If outside of the project directory, tell \u201cdotnet\u201d which project to run\nby passing a reference to the project file (HelloWorld.csproj\u00b0) in via the \u201c--project\u201d command-line\nargument:\n\n$ dot", "net run --project HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj\nHello World!\n\nIf you're inside the project directory, this becomes a simple \u201cdotnet run\u201d; .NET assemblies know their\nentry point intrinsically.\n\nIf you're feeling curious, poke into the \u201cbin/Debug\u201d directory underneath HelloWorld; in it resides the\ngenerated compiler artifacts, including the .NET assembly, \u201cHelloWorld.dll,\u201d and its debugger support\nfile, \u201cHelloWorld.pdb.\u201d It may seem strange that one", " would \u201cexecute\u201d a DLL, but an assembly, like a\nJAR file, is a repository of bytecode (but with much tighter cohesion than a JAR file provides), and the\nextension is (for the most part) almost entirely irrelevant. The dotnet launcher serves much the same\npurpose as the Java launcher does: to find the assembly specified on the command-line, load it, then\nexecute the entry point method and get out of the way.\n\nHello, .NET: IDE style\n\nIf Visual Stud", "io (or Visual Studio for Mac) has finished installing, fire it up, and either select \u201cFile | New\nProject,\u201d or use the Start Page displayed in the center of the IDE to begin a new project by clicking\none of the \u201cNew Project\u201d templates. Depending on which Visual Studio you're running, you may be\npresented with two kinds of console applications: one that represents a native Console Application\n(for Windows, it will reference .NET Framework) and one ", "that targets .NET Core (that\u2019s the open-\nsource implementation). Choose either one (I prefer .NET Core), then do the usual IDE thing of\nchoosing which directory in which the project should live, and its name. Note that we can designate\nthis as a Git repository as well. Once finished, Visual Studio will think for a bit, then show the finished\ntemplate, complete with C# code, ready for editing, building, and debugging.\n\n\u00a9 The .NET Core tooling took", " a bit of a detour recently through the world of JSON by working off of a \u201cproject.\njson\u201d file, which is still mentioned in a number of .NET Core tutorials; that has been deprecated in favor of the\nMSBuild-based files, and is no longer supported.

The Gods of Computer Science have been appeased by the creation of a\nsuccessful HelloWorld application. It's time to take a pass across the C# language.", "\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nC#, Succinctly\n\nWhile we can\u2019t cover the entirety of the C# language in half a dozen pages, we can cover the key\nconcepts of C# pretty quickly. In fact, we can do it in one sentence: C# is an object-oriented language\nthat borrows heavily from its lexical ancestors, C++ and Java, and from other \u201ccomponent\u201d-oriented\nlanguages such as Delphi. In recent years, C# (like most languages) has begun to incorporate\n\nmore functio", "nal programming concepts into its syntax, and as a result presents a pretty multi-\nparadigmatic set of capabilities.\n\nIn other words, take Java, throw in a number of the features Java developers have debated for a\ndecade or more, then add a bunch of functional programming concepts, stir well, bake for 15 years,\nand serve. Microsoft's language designers have been much more aggressive than Sun's when it\ncomes to introducing new features into their ", "respective languages, so for the most part a Java\ndeveloper's experience with C# will probably be characterized by \u201cOh, sure, that all looks pretty\nsimilar\u2014wait, what is THAT?\u201d\n\nBy the way, C# currently sits at version 7.2 at the time of this writing, and Microsoft's language\ndesigners have been just as aggressive in the latest revisions of the language as they were in the\nearly ones. This is a language under constant evolution, for good or for i", "ll. So there's much to discuss,\nand we will not be able to cover the entire surface area of the language\u2014the focus here will be only\non those parts that will be unintuitive to the Java developer looking at \u201caverage\u201d C# code.\n\nC# Basics\n\nTo begin, let's take a look at what was generated as part of those \u201cHelloWorld\u201d console applications,\nsince that\u2019s probably the easiest way to get started.\n\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloDotNet\n\n{\nclass Program\n{\n", "static void Main(string[] args)\n{\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n}\n}\n}\n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to spot a number of things right off the bat: C# is a C-family language, using curly-\nbrackets to denote scope blocks and semicolons to terminate statements. Code is organized into\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nnamespaces using the \u201cnamespace\u201d keyword, and pretty clearly we have classes just as Java does.\nThe Console class (part of the \u201cSystem\u201d namespace) re", "presents the command-line input/output\nfacilities, and WriteLine is obviously a synonym for \u201cprintIn.\u201d Square brackets are used to denote an\narray in the same way they do in Java, and arrays in C# work almost exactly the same way as they do\nin Java, save that they have been slightly more \u201cformalized\u201d in that there is a full-blown class, System.\nArray, that defines a number of methods and properties that all arrays will share. Core \u201cprimitive\u201d\ntyp", "es are actually defined as full-blown classes, so that System.Array is the \u201cclass\u201d representing each\narray instance, System.String is the \u201cstring\u201d primitive type, System.Int32 is the \u201cint\u201d primitive type,\nand so on. All types, whether \u201cprimitive\u201d (what .NET calls \u201cvalue types\u201d) or \u201cclass,\u201d all inherit from\nthe base System.Object type, with value types being \u201cboxed\u201d to objects when necessary. (This was\nthe inspiration for autoboxing rules in Java5", ", in fact.) As a result, \u201cSystem.String s\u201d and \u201cstring s\u201d are\nactually entirely equivalent declarations. New value types can be defined, but it\u2019s pretty rare.\n\nLet's start with some of the more straightforward parts of the language.\n\nStarting exploration: classes, properties,\nand methods\n\nC# 1.0 was, in large measure, a near-direct clone of Java, with some keyword changes and some new\nfeatures that Java has debated for years: explicit properties ", "and delegates (an early form of lambda\nexpressions). Thus, we can write the traditional \u201cPerson\u201d type in C# like so:\n\nclass Person\n\n{\npublic string FirstName\n{\nget { return this.firstName; }\nset { this.firstName = value; }\n}\n\nprivate string firstName;\n\npublic string LastName\n\n{\nget { return this.lastName; }\n\nset { this.lastName = value; }\n\n}\n\nprivate string lastName;\n\npublic int Age\n\n{\nget { return this.age; }\nset { this.age = value; }\n\n.NET for ", "Java Developers\n\n}\nprivate int age;\npublic Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n\n{\nthis.FirstName = fn;\nthis.LastName = In;\nthis.Age = a;\n\n}\n\nProperties can be read-only by eliminating the \u201cset\u201d clause, and write-only (if that makes sense,\nwhich it rarely does) by eliminating the \u201cget\u201d clause. The implicit parameter to a \u201cset\u201d clause is always\ncalled \u201cvalue,\u201d and there are no restrictions to what a property-get or property-set clause can do\nwithin", " its body, although 95% of the time they simply read and write a field within the class.\n\nSo far, if anything, it seems more verbose than Java. However, that was the C# language as of 15\nyears ago\u2014they\u2019've made a few changes along the way.\n\nOne very common change is to the requirement to actually provide a body to the property-get and\nproperty-set clauses; as is the case in Java, 95% of the time these clauses simply wrap around a field\nand provid", "e encapsulated access and nothing else. Which means, frankly, that the time spent writing\nthe implementation for these is pretty much a waste of time (and something that IDEA or other IDEs\ncan generate for us). The C# language designers agreed, and in C# 3.0 added the concept of \u201cauto-\nimplemented properties,\u201d which asks the C# compiler to not only generate the property method\nimplementations, but also synthesize the field used for the backing st", "ore. This simplifies the Person\nclass down to:\n\nclass Person\n\n{\npublic string FirstName { get; set; }\npublic string LastName { get; set; }\npublic int Age { get; set; }\npublic Person(string fn, string In, int a)\n{\nthis.FirstName = fn;\nthis.LastName = ln;\nthis.Age = a;\n}\n}\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nThat\u2019s...awfully terse. But what about those scenarios where we want to have the property available\nto be read by anyone (public access), but only acce", "ssible for mutation from within the class (private\naccess)? The get and set clauses can have different levels of access, the most common idiom being:\n\nclass Person\n\n{\npublic string FirstName { get; private set; }\npublic string LastName { get; private set; }\npublic int Age { get; private set; }\npublic Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n{\nthis.FirstName = fn;\nthis.LastName = In;\nthis.Age = a;\n}\n}\n\nThis will effectively make the fields immutable fr", "om the outside yet still something we can\n\nchange from the interior of the class. The field itself is synthesized by the compiler (usually with\n\na straightforward name such as \u201c__$<Person>$<FirstName>@5417,\" or something equally non-\nobvious), and won't be directly accessible by code. (Granted, one can always use System.Reflection\u2014\nthe .NET direct equivalent to Java's java.lang.reflect package\u2014to access the field at runtime, but\nthat\u2019s an awful l", "ot of work to work around something that can be discarded at any time.) For those\nrare situations where the auto-generated properties don't do the right thing, C# developers can\nalways \u201cdrop back\u201d to writing the property clauses out longhand and wrapping a declared field.\n\nMethods, meanwhile, work pretty much the same way they do in Java, in terms of their declaration\nand syntax. Methods can be instance methods or static (although static method i", "nvocations must\nalways go through the class name, whereas Java will allow calling a static method through an\ninstance variable\u2014seriously, try it, it's weird), and parameters are declared in order with a type and a\nname:\n\npublic class Person\n\nt\npublic string FirstName { get; set; }\n\npublic string LastName { get; set; }\npublic int Age { get; set; }\n\npublic Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n\n{\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nthis.FirstName = fn;\nthis.L", "astName = In;\nthis.Age = a;\n\n}\npublic void SayHello(string recipient)\n{\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, {@}, I, {1}, say hello.\",\nrecipient, FirstName) ;\n}\n}\nclass Program\n{\nStatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\nPerson p = new Person(\"Ted\", \"Neward\", 46);\np.SayHello(\"Fred\") ;\n}\n}\n\nAs you can see, C# follows pretty much exactly the same rules that Java does for method declaration\nand invocation. But, again, C# allows for some interesting variations on this ", "theme.\n\nFor starters, C# has had the concept of \u201cmethod literals\u201d since 1.0, though the syntax has changed\nover each successive revision of the language. The first step was \u201cdelegates,\u201d essentially the ability\nto declare a method signature and then assign methods-on-object-instances to a given delegate\ninstance, like so:\n\nclass Person\n\n{\n// ws.\npublic delegate void HelloProc(string recipient) ;\npublic HelloProc IndirectSayHello;\n}\nclass Program\n{", "\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\nPerson p = new Person(\"Ted\", \"Neward\", 46);\np.SayHello(\"Fred\") ;\np.IndirectSayHello = p.SayHello;\np.IndirectSayHello(\"Fred\") ;\n}\n}\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nThis was a pretty verbose way of doing method-reference-capture, and with successive versions of\nC#, they simplified it, particularly once the .NET platform introduced generics. (Yes, C# has generics,\nyes they look syntactically almost identical to Java gen", "erics, but no, they don\u2019t work the same way\nwhen compiled\u2014where Java uses \u201ctype erasure,\u201d C# uses \u201creified generics\u201d and persists the generic\ndefinition all the way into the compiled bytecode.) The \u201cdelegate\u201d keyword here introduces a new\ntype\u2014a function pointer, if you will\u2014and we can declare an instance of the delegate on the Person\nclass, assign a method to it, and invoke the assigned method through that delegate.\n\nLambdas, type inference, and", " extension classes\n\nBy the time C# 3.0 came around, however, C# supported full-bore lambda syntax, complete with\nmethod parameter type inference, so that we could write method literals in-line:\n\np.IndirectSayHello = (recipient) => {\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hey, {0}. Whatever.\", recipient) ;\n\n}5\n\np.IndirectSayHello(\"Shaggy\") ;\n\nLambdas turned out to be a major turning point within the C# language, along with several other\nfeatures of the C# 3.0 release", ", including local variable type inference, which simply allows for the\n\nkeyword \u201cvar\u201d to appear in place of the type in a local variable declaration, like so:\n\nvar X = 12;\n\nvar y = \"Fred\";\nvar z = p.IndirectSayHello;\nz(\"Wilma\") ;\n\nThe \u201cvar\u201d keyword does not, as some in the Java world theorized at its introduction, create an\nuntyped variable; the C# compiler simply infers the variable\u2019s type from the right-hand-side\nexpression, and assigns that to", " the variable type. Thus, the \u201cx\u201d variable is strongly typed as an\ninteger (since that is an integer literally on the right-hand side), \u201cy\" is a string, and \u201cz\" is a delegate\nthat accepts a method reference that takes a single string parameter and returns void. All the\n\u201cvar\u201d keyword does, simply, is allow the C# developer a brief respite from having to type out type\n\nsignatures In places where the compiler could figure it out on its own.\n\nOn top ", "of this, Microsoft also introduced a fascinating feature called \u201cextension classes,\u201d which has\nfound its way into other languages such as Swift. In short, a class can write \u201cextension methods\u201d\nthat can effectively \u201cinject\u201d themselves as method declarations onto other classes, adding new\nfunctionality to classes already compiled. (It's vaguely reminiscent of aspects as described by\nAspectJ, but a strictly limited subset thereof.)\n\nFor example, ass", "ume that it\u2019s becoming really common to want to count the number of words in\na given String. In the earliest days of Java, it was assumed that we could extend the String class to\nadd that kind of functionality, but Sun very quickly clamped down on that, made String final, and\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nearned the (short-lived) wrath of Java developers everywhere. Java developers were forced to write\n\u201cStringUtils\u201d classes that had static methods o", "n them to count the words in a string, similar to this C#\nequivalent:\n\npublic class StringUtils\n\n{\npublic static int WordCount(String str)\n{\nreturn str.Split(new char[] { ' ', \u2018.', \u2018?' },\nStringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries ).Length;\n}\n}\n\nFrankly, though, using this left a pretty bitter taste in everybody's mouth, since it smacked of doing\nprocedural programming. Java developers just learned to live with it; C# language designers said,\n\u201cWe can ", "go one step better.\u201d If you agree that the class will never have any instance data and never\nbe instantiated as an instance (declare the class \u201cstatic\u201d), then it can use the first parameter to declare\na \u201cthis\u201d parameter, and essentially declare a method that will appear on the targeted class, like so:\n\npublic static class MyStringExtensions\n\n{\npublic static int WordCount(this String str)\n{\nreturn str.Split(new char[] { ' ', \u2018.', \u2018?' },\nStringSpli", "tOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries ).Length;\n}\n}\n\n(Note that \u201cString\u201d is shorthand for \u201cSystem.String,\u201d which is a synonym for the earlier type \u201cstring.\u201d\nAll of the \u201cprimitive types\u201d in C# are aliases for the System-namespaced types, so \u201cint\u201d is the same\nas \u201cSystem.Int32,\" and so on. This has to do with how C# allows the declaration of \u201cvalue types,\u201d and\nwhile a fascinating discussion in its own right, it\u2019s a little out-of-scope from what we're doing he", "re.)\n\nThis extension class means that now we can write the following:\n\nvar words = \"One two three four\";\nvar wordCount = words.WordCount(); // 4\n\nExtension classes don't just magically apply everywhere, however\u2014they must be brought into scope\nvia the use of the \u201cusing\u201d statements, so that if we don't care to use the MyStringExtensions, the\nWordCount() method won't appear on String types. And the original class remains unaffected, which\nmeans that", " the WordCount() extension (like all extensions) cannot have any impact on the internals\nof the extended class\u2014in fact, it can't see any of the internal members, and so can only ever be able\nto use the public interface of the extended class. It\u2019s purely compiler syntactic sugar.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nLanguage-|INtegrated Query (LINQ)\n\nAll of this led up to one of the signature moments for the C# compiler with the 3.0 release:\nLanguage-INtegr", "ated Query, or LINQ, for short. To many in the Java community, LINQ represented\neverything that was wrong with Microsoft, accusing them of \u201cembedding SQL into the C# language\u201d\nand turning C# into a 4GL that was proprietarily bound to SQL Server. As the Jedi Master put it,\n\u201cAmazing\u2014every single part of that sentence is entirely incorrect.\u201d LINQ wasn't integrating SQL, it\nisn't about SQL Server, and it\u2019s actually built up around core language princ", "iples that had nothing to\ndo with relational databases, much less integrated with SQL Server.\n\nLet's start by examining a simple collection of Person objects in a list:\n\nvar people = new List<Person>() {\nnew Person(\"Ted\", \"Neward\", 45),\nnew Person(\"Charlotte\", \"Neward\", 39),\nnew Person(\"Michael\", \"Neward\", 24),\nnew Person(\"Matthew\", \"Neward\", 18),\nnew Person(\"Beth\", \"Massi\", 39),\nnew Person(\"Dustin\", \"Campbell\", 43)\n\n}3\n\nSuppose I want to give ev", "erybody within this list a beer. Sharp readers will notice, of course, that my\nyoungest son is not yet eligible to receive a beer, and this is a family-friendly article, so we don't want\nto get into trouble with the local authorities.\n\nWere this a discussion of Java8 lambdas, we would talk about using lambdas and streams to filter\nthe collection before applying a higher-order function across each to give each individual a beer.\n\n(If that\u2019s new to", " you, Venkat Subramaniam has some great conference lectures online that describe\nJava8 lambdas in more detail.) As far back as C# 3.0, Microsoft saw the need, and chose not only to\nlayer functional principles into the language, but to put a syntax in place that would actually hide the\nfact that this was ever functional programming in the first place:\n\nvar drinkers =\nfrom p in people\nwhere p.Age > 21\nselect p;\n\nThis is a LINQ query expression, and", " despite the fact that it looks similar to SQL, it's actually invoking\nseveral functional methods in sequence using a fluent interface; translated out of the SQL-like syntax,\nit looks more like:\n\ndrinkers = people.Where((p) => p.Age > 21);\nAll of the traditional functional operations are present here\u2014map, filter, and the rest\u2014but they\n\n\u201chide\u201d behind this query expression syntax. We'll talk more about the interesting features and\nimplications of L", "INQ when we get to Entity Framework in the last section, but for now, just think of\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nLINQ as a syntax that is designed to deliberately bring some of the set-oriented nature of SQL and the\nfunctional-oriented nature of languages such as Haskell into the C# language as a first-class citizen.\n\n(For anybody who really wants to see LINQ taken to an absolute extreme, it can be instructional to\nlook at Luke Hoban\u2019's \u201csingle-LIN", "Q-expression-ray-tracer\u201d blog post from 10 years ago, available at\nhttps://aka.ms/lingraytracer. It will send chills down your back, one way or another.)\n\nAsynchronous programming with Async/Await\n\nC# 4.0 introduced a number of interesting features, but C# 5.0 truly bucked the status quo by\nintroducing language support for a form of asynchronous programming via the \u201casync\u201d and \u201cawait\u201d\nkeywords. While not a general-purpose, all-around concurrency ", "feature, async/await added the\nability to easily add \u201clittle concurrency\u201d into common programming tasks such as issuing a request\nfor a database query or executing a Web API request without having to manually manage the\nthreads necessary to do so without blocking. Leveraging some work done elsewhere on the .NET\nplatform (the Task Parallel Library, or TPL), C# essentially now allows developers to start some work\nand return a Task<T> object, which ", "represents that additional work. At the source code level, \u201casync\u201d\ncan decorate either a method signature or an anonymous method literal to indicate it should run\nasynchronously, and \u201cawait\u201d tells the compiler to generate the code necessary to hold things in place\nuntil the asynchronous code completes. (Essentially, these are language-level implementations of\n\u201coromises,\u201d which are permeating the JavaScript world and slowly starting to gather stea", "m in the Java\nworld as well, under the name \u201cCompletableFuture\u201d out of the java.util.concurrent package in Java8.)\n\nasync Task PlaySongsAsync(int[] ids)\n\n{\nforeach (var id in ids)\n{\ntry\n{\nvar data = await service.GetEncodedDataAsync(id) ;\nvar song = await Task.Run(() => Decode(data) );\nawait PlayAsync(song);\n}\ncatch (Exception e) { /* just skip the song */ }\n}\n}\n\nThere is much, much more we can discuss with respect to C#, but then we'd have no ti", "me to talk\nabout anything else, and there is much, much more to go over on our tour. Fortunately, Microsoft has\na great collection of web resources on the language, starting with a page that lists an overall history\nof the language, available at https://aka.ms/csharpwhatsnew, and a general (if abbreviated) overview\nof the language available at https://aka.ms/csharptour. And, of course, there\u2019re books. Lots and lots\nof books.\n\nBut once you know ho", "w to write code in this language, what can you do with it?\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nFrameworks, for the Win!\n\nBy far and away, the most popular thing to do with C# and the .NET runtime is to build a web\napplication of some form, just as it is with the Java language and runtime. To be sure, the .NET\necosystem supports more than this\u2014one can build desktop applications, mobile applications, and\neven games (using the aforementioned Unity framework,", " among others), but the lion\u2019s share of code\nwritten in C# is web applications.\n\nLike its twin, .NET offers a comprehensive framework of web functionality, ranging all the way\nfrom drag-and-drop-built user interface, to MVC-based server-side rendering, to the construction\nof HTTP-based APIs for invocation by single-page applications written in JavaScript or mobile\napplications. Somewhat confusingly, however, all three are referred to by the name ", "\u201cASP.NET.\u201d\n\n(Note to those who recognize the \u201cASP\u201d moniker from the early days of the Sun/Microsoft rivalry: In\nthe COM days, Microsoft's web technology was called \u201cActive Server Pages,\u201d ASP for short, named\nafter Activex, one of the marketing names for COM. When Microsoft started working on the CLR\ninternally, one of its most important consumers was the ASP team, who sought to create a system\nsimilar to JSP to replace ASP. Since the effort was t", "o redo ASP in .NET, the name \u201cASP.NET\u201d was\ncoined. However, aside from the basic notion that \u201cthis is for the web,\u201d there's little to no relationship\nbetween ASP.NET and its predecessor.)\n\nThe ASP.NET \u201cfamily\u201d is fundamentally broken into three parts, two of which we'll examine here (in\nbrief):\n\n\u00a2 ASP.NET WebForms, the first flavor of ASP.NET, released with .NET 1.0, featuring drag-and-drop\nuser interface construction. It was designed to try to b", "ring a VisualBasic-style design philosophy\nto the web, but by .NET 3.0, the Microsoft community had come to understand the design\nadvantages of an MVC-style design approach, and all work on WebForms essentially ceased.\nIronically, about the time that interest in WebForms was ending, the Java community was building\nup JSF, the equivalent to WebForms in Java.\n\n\u00a2 ASP.NET MVC: Based on the classic \u201cModel-View-Controller\u201d principles that the Sun \u201cMode", "l 2\u201d\ndesign for servlets and JSP first laid out, Microsoft created ASP.NET MVC, released the source code\nfor it shortly after its initial release, and has considered this to be its first-class server-side web\nframework ever since. ASP.NET MVC was rebranded (and refactored) to be \u201cASP.NET Core MVC\" in\n2015, in keeping with the \u201c.NET Core\u201d naming for the cross-platform runtime, and has made some\nconceptual shifts as new frameworks\u2014such as Ruby-on-R", "ails\u2014gained popularity and created\nsome new patterns (such as routing tables).\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n\u00a2 ASP.NET MVC Web API: While the name certainly gets no points for brevity, it does accurately\nreflect the idea that this framework is built off of the same concepts that underlie the ASP.NET\nMVC library, but with the intent of producing JSON data instead of HTML. When ASP.NET MVC was\ntagged with the \u201cCore\u201d moniker, the \u201cMVC\" was formally dro", "pped from Web API projects, so that\nnow they are simply \u201cASP.NET Core Web API,\u201d or more informally, \u201cWeb API\" projects.\n\nLet's have a look at a quick ASP.NET Core Web API application\u2014the ubiquitous TODO list\u2014and then\nwe'll have a quick look at an MVC application before we look at Microsoft's data-storage framework,\nEntity Framework.\n\nASP.NET Core Web API\n\nTo get started with Core Web API, we first need to scaffold out the Web API template; this c", "an be\ndone either via \u201cFile|New\u201d in one of the Visual Studio IDEs, or from the command-line using the .NET\nCore CLI tools by executing \u201cdotnet new webapi -o todoapi.\u201d This will create a subdirectory called\n\u201ctodoapi\" and install the .NET Core Web API project inside of it. Out of the box, it scaffolds out a\nsimple API that has one controller to hand back arbitrary \u201cvalue\u201d objects, accessible at\nhttp://localhost:5000/api/values. Before we make any c", "hanges to the code, It's always good to make\nsure the scaffold is working, so execute a \u201cdotnet run\u201d from within the \u201ctodoapi\" directory, and\nnavigate to the given URL; the response should be a dirt-simple JSON array containing two strings.\n\nA Web API project, like its cousin the MVC application, is broken into models and controllers, with\nthe \u201cview\u201d assumed to be an automated conversion from a model object into JSON. Thus, in a Web\nAPI project, ", "the goal will be to accept incoming requests, perform the necessary business logic, and\nreturn the appropriate model type, usually corresponding to the resource type in the URL, to be\nconverted to JSON.\n\nThe Controllers directory contains the code for the ValuesController, which is the default-scaffolded\ncode. It doesn't use any model objects, which means It's clearly inferior. Let's delete it, and replace it\nwith something that's a little more \u201c", "MV\"-like. That means, first of all, that we need a model object to\nrepresent a TODO item, which is a pretty simple domain object:\n\npublic class Todo\n\n{\npublic long ID { get; set; }\npublic string Description { get; set; }\npublic bool Completed { get; set; }\npublic Todo()\n{\nCompleted = false;\n}\n}\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n(Note that it would be a bit irregular to call this a POJO, since it's not a Java object, but that\u2019s basically\nexactly what thi", "s is. These are sometimes referred to as Plain Old C# Objects, POCOs, or, less often,\nPlain Old DotNet Objects or PODNOs. Definitely doesn't roll off the tongue like POJOs, but we do\nwhat we can.)\n\nHaving a domain object, it now remains to build a controller that will respond to the appropriate\nURL (which, by convention, will be prefixed by \u201c/api,\u201d but is of course configurable). The Web API\nexpectation is that a controller will be a class that h", "as a number of public methods that obey some\nconventions, in terms of both method names and parameter sets, like Java has done with later\nversions of the Servlet and EJB specifications.\n\n[Route(\"api/[ controller ]\") ]\npublic class TodosController : Controller\n{\nprivate List<Todo> todos = new List<Todo>() {\nnew Todo() { ID=@, Description=\"Get milk\", Completed=true },\nnew Todo() { ID=1, Description=\"Get pet food\" },\nnew Todo() { ID=2, Description=\"", "Learn .NET Core\u201d },\nnew Todo() { ID=3, Description=\"Write billion-dollar app\" }\n\n}3\n\n// GET api/todos\n\n[HttpGet ]\n\npublic IEnumerable<Todo> Get()\n{\n\nreturn todos;\n\n// GET api/todos/5\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\") ]\npublic Todo Get(int id)\n\n{\nreturn todos.First((t) => t.ID == id);\n}\n// POST api/todos\n[HttpPost |\npublic void Post([FromBody]|Todo value)\n{\ntodos.Add(value) ;\n}\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\n// PUT api/todos/5\n[HttpPut(\"{id}\") ]\npublic void Put(int id", ", [FromBody]|Todo value)\n\n{\nvar todo = todos.First((t) => t.ID == id);\ntodo.Description = value.Description;\ntodo.Completed = value.Completed;\n\n}\n\n// DELETE api/todos/5\n[HttpDelete(\"{id}\") ]\npublic void Delete(int id)\n{\n\n}\n\nTo understand this class, it\u2019s important to understand a few things: First, the square-bracketed\ndeclarations outside each method are what .NET calls \u201ccustom attributes,\u201d which, true story, figured\nprominently in the design fo", "r JSR-175 annotations. The attributes provide information (via reflection,\nsame way annotations do) about how HTTP verbs should match against the methods\u2014so, for\nexample, the ASP.NET runtime can know that the two Get() methods should both be invoked when\nan incoming GET request is made.\n\nThe other half of that binding, of course, is knowing the partial URL pattern that should trigger the\nmethod. Notice that the controller class itself has an attr", "ibute, \u201cRouting,\u201d which contains the string\n\u201capi/[controller].\u201d The square-bracketed \u201ccontroller\u201d is to tell the ASP.NET runtime to use the name\nof the class, minus its \u201c-Controller\u201d suffix, so the URL pattern for all of these API endpoints is \u201capi/\ntodos.\u201d From here, standard REST conventions kick in\u2014a GET to \u201capi/todos\u201d should return all of the\nTODO items, so the Get() method taking no parameters and returning an IEnumerable<Todo> (think\nof it ", "as a high-level iterator interface) is the right one to invoke here. If, on the other hand, a caller\nwants a single TODO, they'll issue a request with a URL pattern of \u201capi/todos/\u201d plus the ID of the\nTODO requested. The second Get() method indicates that the URL pattern includes \u201c{id},\" so \u201capi/\ntodos/3\u201d will extract \u201c3\u201d and pass it for the value of \u201cid\u201d to the method. Ditto for the Put and Delete\nmethods.\n\nThe full details of routing are in the ", "ASP.NET documentation, but this should be sufficient to\nunderstand what's happening here. To see the new controller in action, just do a \u201cdotnet run\u201d from\nthe \u201ctodoapi\u201d directory, and point an HTTP client (curl or Postman) at http://localhost:5000/api/todos\nto see the JSON representations handed back.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nASP.NET Core MVC\n\nHTTP-based APIs are nice, but when we need a traditional server-side rendered application, ASP.NET\npro", "vides a traditional MVC framework called (not surprisingly) ASP.NET Core MVC. It\u2019s the same MVC\nwe find in most modern web frameworks; views are rendered using a particular template syntax,\ncalled \u201cRazor\u201d (or \u201cRazor pages\") that is designed to be expressive yet terse. It\u2019s a syntax inspired\nfrom other similar frameworks, particularly JSP and Ruby-on-Rails, but also tried to be reasonably\nfamiliar to generations of ASP and ASP.NET WebForms develop", "ers. Controllers look almost the same\nas they do in the API scenario, and models, of course, are just C# classes representing the domain.\n\nRazor templates use a .cshtml extension, and like JSP, they use different syntax to indicate which\nparts of the page are to be interpreted in a code-aware manner, as opposed to being taken literally\nas output format. Razor syntax uses the \u201c@\" symbol to set off code blocks or other processing\nstatements in seve", "ral different ways; for example, to do a simple \u201cfor\u201d loop within a page, Razor uses\nan \u201c@for\" to set off the loop. Unlike JSP, however, the Razor syntax Is clear enough that there isn\u2019t a\nneed to require explicit symbols to set off between code and HTML output:\n\n<h2>Welcome</h2>\n<ul>\n@for (int i = 03; i < 33 i++)\n{\n<li>Beetlejuice</1li>\n}\n</ul>\n\nViews, of course, can make use of objects and data provided by a controller, often by making use\nof a", " predefined key-value map called ViewData. If we want the message and the number of times\n\nit should be printed to be set up by a controller (perhaps the controller is obtaining it from HTML\nquery parameters or a database), then the controller can set those by using the keys \u201cMessage\u201d and\n\u201cNumTimes\u201d in the ViewData dictionary, respectively. The view can then display them like this:\n\n<h2>Welcome</h2>\n<ul>\n@for (int i = 03; i < (int)ViewData[\"NumTi", "mes\"]; i++)\n{\n<1i>@ViewData|[ \"Message\" |</1li>\n}\n</ul>\n\nIn essence, ViewData is the ASP.NET equivalent to Servlet \u201crequest\u201d scope.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nThe controller perspective that drives this looks remarkably similar to what a servlet controller would\ndo, with a few differences:\n\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\nusing System. Text.Encodings.Web;\n\nnamespace MvcMovie.Controllers\n\n{\npublic class HelloWorldController : Controller\n{\npublic I", "ActionResult Welcome(string name, int numTimes = 1)\n{\nViewData[\"Message\"] = \"Hello \" + name;\nViewData[\"NumTimes\"] = numTimes;\nreturn View();\n}\n}\n}\n\nNotice that the Welcome method takes two parameters, which will be filled in from HTML query\nparameters, fills in the ViewData dictionary, and then calls \u201cView,\u201d which then looks for a Razor page\nfile whose name matches that of the method\u2014in this case, it will be looking for \u201cWelcome.cshtml.\u201d\nASP.NET ", "Core MVC has a number of ways to adjust and change these conventions, but out of the\nbox, the convention-based approach makes It simpler and easier than the configuration descriptor\napproach of older Servlet versions.\n\nASP.NET Core MVC obviously consists of a great deal more than just what we've discussed here, but\nthe underlying message should be clear: ASP.NET Core (both the MVC and the Web API versions)\nlearned a great deal from its contempora", "ries, including those in the Servlet world USP, the Play\nframework, and more), and as such, it will be very straightforward for a Java developer to pick up and\nexplore.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into the code above, consider having a look into this tutorial:\n\nhttps://aka.ms/first-web-api.\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nEntity Framework Core\n\nOf course, being able to access the server and pass JSON back and forth Is only half the story; t", "he\nother half is taking that data and storing it. Or rather, storing it, indexing it, searching it, collating\n\nit, sorting it, drawing pretty graphs with it, and more. When working with a relational database,\n\nthe technology Microsoft offers its .NET constituents is called Entity Framework, or EF, and in many\nrespects it works like any other object/relational mapping framework does. Thanks to some of the\nlanguage features in C#, however, in many ", "cases working with EF is actually easier than working with\nJPA or Hibernate.\n\nLike much in the .NET universe, Entity Framework is undergoing a bit of a reshuffle; what used to\n\nbe a closed, proprietary source base is now open, and as EF was opened to the world, the project\nowners thought a (slight) rebrand seemed appropriate. As a result, the open-source version of EF is\ncalled \u201cEntity Framework Core,\u201d and to begin using it, we need to install it", " into the project via NuGet,\neither by using the Package Manager in Visual Studio, or by using the command-line for .NET Core by\nentering:\n\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\n\nThis is, of course, assuming we are using SQLServer\u2014since not everybody uses SQL Server, however,\na number of different EF database providers are available, including MySQL, Postgres, SQLite,\nFirebase, and a few more. (Third-party vendors are constan", "tly introducing new ones, in a manner\nsimilar to the JDBC driver ecosystem, so bear in mind that Microsoft may not even know all the EF\nproviders in the world.)\n\nThere'\u2019re a few \u201cmanagement\u201d tasks that will be easier to do from the command-line, and EF has a\ncommand-line package that installs \u201cinside\u201d the standard .NET Core command-line tool, but as of this\nwriting, making use of it requires adding a line by hand to the project's .csproj file:\n\n<", "ItemGroup>\n<DotNetCliToolReference\nInclude=\"Microsoft. EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet\"\nVersion=\"2.0.0\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n\nIn addition, the EF Core command-ling tooling requires another dependent package:\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design\n\nAt this point, EF should be installed and ready to go. More detailed instructions can be found on the\n\nMicrosoft docs site at https://aka.ms/ef-install.\n\nFundamentally, the most critical el", "ement to using EF from a project is the DbContext. This is a class\nfrom which a project will create a derived class that represents the \u201ccontext\u201d for this project against\nthe database\u2014it will be a repository, session, and gateway, all rolled into one. Like many object/\nrelational tools, it also provides some core behavior, including some migration capabilities (database\nversioning).\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nLike Hibernate or JPA, EF uses classe", "s to represent entities in the database, and these classes are\noften referred to as \u201cmodel\u201d objects, since they typically serve that purpose in an MVC and/or Web\nAPI application. These will usually look like \u201cplain old C# objects,\u201d with the odd custom attribute to\nhelp give EF some additional hints about how to map to the database table they represent.\n\nFor example, if the application is a blog, then we will want classes representing a blog, and ", "blog\npost, representing a single blog entry. But there\u2019s also some blog metadata we might want to track\nthat wouldn't be appropriate to store in the database (such as whether the blog was stored in the\ndatabase), which we will want Entity Framework to ignore entirely. One way to do this Is to use a\ncustom attribute, or the EF Fluent API can indicate that the blog metadata class should be ignored\nusing the \u201cOnModelCreating\u201d method, invoked when th", "e database schema is created.\n\npublic class BloggingContext : DbContext\n\n{\npublic DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }\nprotected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n{\nmodelBuilder.Ignore<BlogMetadata>() ;\n}\n}\npublic class Blog\n{\npublic int BlogId { get; set; }\npublic string Url { get; set; }\npublic List<Post> Posts { get; set; }\npublic BlogMetadata Metadata { get; set; }\n}\npublic class Post\n{\npublic int PostId { get; set; }\npublic", " string Title { get; set; }\npublic string Content { get; set; }\npublic Blog Blog { get; set; }\n}\npublic class BlogMetadata\n{\npublic DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; }\n}\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nThe \u201cId\u201d fields, of course, are typically primary key integer columns in the database, and the List\n\nof Posts is a classic one-to-many relationship. All of this will be eminently familiar to any user of\nHibernate, JPA, or other object-relational m", "odeling system. What will be different will be the way in\nwhich queries and modifiers are run; thanks to LINQ, Entity Framework uses an entirely new style of\nquery starting from the DbSet fields modeled on the DbContext-inheriting class. To do a query to\nfetch all the blogs from the system, we simply create an instance of the context inside of a \u201cusing\u201d\nblock (which is the inspiration for the try-with-resources block in Java7), and use that insta", "nce to\nobtain the set of Blog instances and iterate through them:\n\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext() )\n{\nforeach (var blog in context.Blogs) {\n// do something with the blog\n\nContrary to what we experienced during the heyday of EJB Entity Beans, however, this isn\u2019t a case\n\nof early loading or late loading; under the hood, Entity Framework is making use of \u201cenumerator\nobjects\u201d (very similar to Java8 streams and the Java Iterable<T> interfa", "ce) to fetch objects in batches,\njust as a typical database cursor would do.\n\nIn the Java world, however, filtering that list of blogs to include only those that have \u201cdotnet\u201d in\n\nthe URL presented problems\u2014either the filtering happens on the database side, in which case the\nquery has to be translated to SQL, or the filtering happens on the client side, which means the entire\ncollection has to be brought over the network. With LINQ, however, this", " looks like this:\n\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext() )\n\n{\nforeach (var blog in context.Blogs\n-Where(b => b.Url.Contains(\"dotnet\"))) {\n// do something with the blog\n}\n}\n\nBut this has the same drawbacks as before; instead, we can use an \u201cexpression tree,\u201d a feature of\nLINQ that compiles into a runtime structure that reflects the compiled code:\n\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext() )\n{\nvar allDotnetBlogUrls = from blog in context.Blog", "s\nwhere blog.Url.Contains (\"dotnet\")\nselect blog.Url;\n\n.NET for Java Developers\n\nforeach (var url in allDotnetBlogUrls) {\n// do something with the blog URL\n// note we don't have the entire Blog, just the Url\n\nThis \u201cfrom-where-select\u201d syntax that looks so much like SQL isn\u2019t; it\u2019s a syntax that\u2019s designed to look\nsimilar to SQL and offer many of the same kinds of operators and options. However, this isn't an SQL\nquery\u2014it will not be sent to the da", "tabase. Instead, the expression tree is analyzed\u2014and optimized\u2014\nby the EF plumbing to generate an efficient SQL statement, on a driver-by-driver basis. This means\nthat the query filters and restrictions are analyzed on the client side, but sent to the database to be\nexecuted\u2014for example, the above turns into a \u201cSELECT url FROM blog WHERE...\u201d using whatever\nprimitives to do a string-containment check that the database and EF provider offers. This ", "is really\nthe best-of-both-worlds scenario. Couple that with the compile-time type checking that the C#\ncompiler provides against the model objects, and you have a solution that is entirely new to the Java\nworld. (Not impossible to provide, mind you, but still something the Java world currently lacks.)\n\nUpdates and modifications entail making modifications on the model object, and those changes\nwill be sent to the database when the context object", " goes out of the using block's scope. To add\na new blog, construct the object and add it to the DbSet on the context object; to remove it, use\nthe context\u2019s DbSet again. And should you really, really want to write raw SQL, the context object\nprovides that capacity.\n\nThere is, of course, much more to discuss about Entity Framework\u2014it's every bit as rich and powerful\nas JPA, and as such, definitely larger than just what we can cover in a single pap", "er.

We haven't begun to explo", "re the different open-source frameworks that do dependency\ninjection.
