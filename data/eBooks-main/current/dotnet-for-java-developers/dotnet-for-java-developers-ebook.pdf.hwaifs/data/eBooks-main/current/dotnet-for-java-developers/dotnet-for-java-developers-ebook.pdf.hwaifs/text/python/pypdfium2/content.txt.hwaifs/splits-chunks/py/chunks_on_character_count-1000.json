It was our first \ntrip out of the country, and aside from the", " ridiculously long flight\u2014eight hours on an airplane feels \nlike forever to somebody who hasn\u2019t yet finished their first decade of life\u2014I really had no idea of \nwhat to expect. In fact, in an amusing anecdote my father has yet to tire of telling, I remember having \nto sit down with my parents in front of a globe so that they could explain to me that \u201cthe United \nStates\u201d was not, in fact, synonymous with \u201cthe world.\u201d\nIt was entirely a trip of firsts: my first experience wandering around in a world where I couldn\u2019t \nunderstand any of the written signs, my first experience eating food I couldn\u2019t recognize, and my \nfirst experience feeling completely lost in the world around me. I found, to my eight-year-old horror, \nthat I couldn\u2019t even figure out which bathroom to use\u2014which, considering I had just the year before \nmanaged to convince my mother I didn\u2019t need to be escorted to the bathroom and back, was of \nparticular concern. I didn\u2019t want her to start thinking I actually needed adult sup", "ervision. This was \nclearly not my home, and I was more than a little terrified of it.\nVisiting a foreign land, particularly to someone who has cocooned themselves entirely in the \nconcepts and cultures of \u201chome,\u201d can be intimidating and overwhelming without a guide. On that trip \nto France I had my parents, and despite neither of them speaking anything close to fluent French, \nthey managed to guide us through the tricky parts. (French-English guidebooks are a wonderful \nthing.) \nFor the typical Java developer, finding a guide to exploring the .NET ecosystem can be tricky, since \nthe average Java developer can still hearken back to a time when expressing an interest in looking at \n.NET was tantamount to declaring a desire to betray everything good and right in the world (or so it \nseemed, at least at the time).\nIn this paper, I will serve as your guide to the .NET world. I\u2019ve been a part of the .NET ecosystem \nalmost as long as I\u2019ve been a part of Java\u2019s. I started with Java in 1996; I", " started with what would \nbecome .NET in 2000, even before it was announced. I\u2019ve built applications in both, written books \nfor both, and explored the source for both. They\u2019re closer to one another than you might think, but \neach has been fundamentally influenced by the people using them. In fact, it\u2019s not a bad analogy to \nthink of them as twin brothers, separated at birth, raised by different sets of parents. Same DNA, but \nshaped by their experiences and events to be different in a number of interesting places.\nIf you\u2019re a Java developer, looking to get started exploring the .NET ecosystem, then suspend what \nyou think you know, take my hand, and let\u2019s take a trip to a foreign land. Doing so will require a little \nhistory to understand how things came to be, then a quick set of instructions on how to get the \ntooling set up (and which tooling you want, depending on your preferences). Once the environment \nis set up, we can pick up the critical differences between C# and Java, and s", "tart diving into some \nof the central frameworks in this world\u2014ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and a few others. When we .NET for Java Developers 2\nfinish up, if you\u2019re following along, you\u2019ll have everything you need to start your own exploration of \nthe .NET community, and from there you\u2019ll get to draw your own conclusions and make your own \nopinions.\nMost importantly, you\u2019ll know how to order off the menu and tell the bathrooms apart. \nReady?.NET for Java Developers 3\nHistory\nIf you\u2019d like to skip the walk down memory lane, you can jump to the next section, Getting Started.\nOstensibly, the history of .NET begins in October of 2000, at Microsoft\u2019s Professional Developer \nConference (PDC), when Microsoft announced to the world that they were working on a new \nprogramming platform, on which would rest the fate of all Microsoft development to follow. It was \ncalled .NET, it would be the backbone for their upcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would \nbe a part of their data management", " system (nicknamed \u201cSQLServer.NET\u201d), and it would form the \ncore development platform for building interconnected applications into the future by leveraging \nemerging standards such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few others the world had not yet really come to \nunderstand. It would be the principal competitor platform to their principal development rival at the \ntime, Sun Microsystems, and its Java platform. And the world could see that the shot was fired, the \nline in the sand drawn, and the armies drawn up; clearly, this was Microsoft copying the efforts of its \ncompetitors, seeking dominance, and\u2026.\nAnd most of the world completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it had come to \nexist, and what Microsoft really sought to obtain from it.\nIn fact, it\u2019s fair to suggest that many within the Microsoft ecosystem misunderstood what .NET was \nreally about; once announced, the marketing machine took over. Much effort was wasted due to the \nentanglement of \u201c.NET\u201d with \u201cweb services,\u201d an", "d it would take the better part of a decade before \npeople could understand that the two really had nothing intrinsically to do with one another any \nmore than \u201cPerl\u201d did with \u201cdatabases.\u201d Microsoft management compounded all this confusion by \nre\u2011branding the \u201c.NET\u201d suffix to a number of their products, which they later corrected but well after \nthe damage had been done.\nBut despite all that, solid engineering rests at the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made \nit harder to see, but it\u2019s always been there. To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its \nproper historical context: that, in truth, it was the simple \u201cnext step\u201d along an evolutionary chain that \nstretched back much further than that October keynote almost two decades ago.\nOf components, managed environments, and code\nIn the beginning, there was C.\nTo be more accurate about it, in the beginning a number of programming languages were created \nto make it easier to produce programs that knew how to ex", "ecute on a single chip. They integrated \ndirectly with the hardware, making use of the facilities there to obtain memory, interact with the \ndisk, and present data to the display for the user to understand. In time, we as an industry found that \nthis direct-hardware interaction had its drawbacks, and we sought to create a series of abstractions \non top of that hardware, to help coordinate the use of the hardware across multiple simultaneously .NET for Java Developers 4\nexecuting programs. We called that first attempt at regulating and managing the hardware an \noperating system. And it was pretty good. So good, in fact, that numerous flavors of operating \nsystem were born, including Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, and Solaris, and macOS (though \nit was called \u201cSystem 7\u201d back then), and Linux, and a few others whose names exist now only in the \nhistory books and dusty corners of Usenet forums. (Bonus points if you recognize these names: \nMinix, Mach, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even", " more bonus points if you ever ran one of them. If you \never ran DOS, though, it just means you\u2019re old.)\nThe bigger, more important issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system \nitself\u2014that programmers found it helpful and useful to have \u201csomething else\u201d working with their \nprograms. That \u201csomething else\u201d would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs \nexecuted and behaved, rather than assuming that every single nuance had to be the programmers\u2019 \nresponsibility. \nThis concept, in large, is essentially that of a \u201cmanaged environment.\u201d Although it has its roots \nin operating systems, it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of \ncontainers and cloud: that there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are \nresponsible for details that the programmer doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with. Operating systems \nare managed environments in that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to", " \nschedule the execution of threads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network \nports or data files. Virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in \nthat they regulate the access and reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode \nformat into CPU-native instructions, and prevent the direct access of memory (except under very \nspecific circumstances) in order to avoid process termination by careless programming. Containers \nsuch as Docker are managed environments in that they provide a context around an executable \nto mimic a precise environment\u2014configuration files, environment variables, and shared network \nsettings\u2014so that developers can be assured that the environment outside their programs are \nconsistent regardless of where they are deployed. \nBy the early \u201990s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for \nWindows developers to be able to take \u201cthe next step forward\u201d in development evol", "ution. The \u201cGUI \nrevolution\u201d of the mid-\u201980s was largely finished; programs weren\u2019t just about \u201cdialogs and data,\u201d \nbut now needed to integrate more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for \nexample) and start taking advantage of networking in greater detail. (Old developers like me will \nremember that it was around 1995 that references to HTTP and \u201cthe World Wide Web\u201d were just \nstarting to appear in publications and technology journals.)\nAs is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges emerged. C++ developers \nhad been speaking of \u201creusable code\u201d for several years, but it was Visual Basic (and Delphi, along with \nseveral other \u201c4GL\u201d variants) that demonstrated actual practical code reuse, in the form of \u201ccontrols\u201d: \nwidgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly without requiring in-depth \nknowledge about the controls\u2019 implementation. Simply obtain the library, put it into the right place \nwithin the development environment,", " drag-and-drop the control into the construction area, and lo, \nthe developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of \u201capplication frameworks,\u201d \nlike MFC and OWL, but \u201cGUI builders\u201d had demonstrated that the concept of \u201ccontrols\u201d could be \nleveraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and events; now .NET for Java Developers 5\nMicrosoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the bigger world beyond GUI development. \nMore importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship\u2014make it possible for outside \ndevelopers to build \u201cthings\u201d that could be used by existing things (such as the operating system or, \nperhaps, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their implementation.\nTo do that, they needed to create a managed environment that would work across a variety of \ndifferent languages, but all operating under the same rules. That effort, called the Component \nObject Model (COM), was the first of several \u201cmanaged pla", "tforms\u201d that emerged during the early\u0002and mid-\u201990s. (Ironically, several open-source efforts would go after this same space many years \nafter Microsoft declared COM \u201cfinished,\u201d including Mozilla\u2019s XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in \nthat it became the backbone of Windows development for a significant percentage of the Windows \nplatform. But it still failed in that it left programs vulnerable to many of the same things that had \nplagued them before: memory leaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpected process termination at \nthe first mistake. It was clear that, despite the managed platform, writing code in a \u201cnative\u201d language \n(such as C/C++ or Delphi) still wasn\u2019t a particularly great place to be.\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that Sun Microsystems demonstrated the HotJava browser \nto the world, the centerpiece of which was this language that could be used to write executable \nbits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft had come to the realization that this was what i", "t \nwas missing: a \u201cmanaged language\u201d to run on top of their managed platform. A managed language \nhad exactly the right \u201cdistance\u201d from the underlying operating system they were seeking\u2014garbage \ncollection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashes, and the virtual machine could \nhelp enforce stronger security controls that the world had just started to realize they needed. It was, \nin many ways, a perfect match. Microsoft invested resources into building their own JVM, extended \ntheir IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrated COM into the runtime.\nUnfortunately, in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own destruction.\nHello, .NET\nDivorces are never a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one is always fraught with opinion, \nrevisionist history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997/1998, two facts were becoming clear: \none, Sun didn\u2019t care for Microsoft\u2019s work increasing interoperability between their JVM and native \nCOM c", "omponents in Windows1\n, and two, Microsoft and Java were going to part ways, one way or \nanother. (Who got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)\nEither certain groups within Microsoft could see the writing on the wall or they had come to find \nissues (real or perceived) with the Java Virtual Machine; either way, by 1998, a new effort came to \nlife inside of Microsoft, designed to bring a new managed platform and managed language into the \nworld. Originally intended as the successor to COM, it went through a variety of names, including \n1 For the curious, Microsoft offered additional platform-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with native \nCOM components. The irony of this is deep, considering that Sun had actually allowed for COM-specific \nnative interfaces in their JNI specification\u2014the first three methods in the interface table for a JNIEnv (\u201cJNI \nenvironment\u201d) object were specifically left \u201creserved\u201d for the necessary three methods (AddRef, Release, and \nQueryInterfac", "e) of every COM interface object. Those three slots are still reserved to this day..NET for Java Developers 6\n\u201cCOM+,\u201d the \u201cComponent Object Runtime\u201d (COR), the \u201cUniversal RunTime\u201d (URT), and \u201cNext\u0002Generation Windows Services\u201d (NGWS) before finally being introduced to the world as \u201c.NET\u201d at that \nOctober 2000 PDC. Along with it would come a new language, code-named \u201cCOOL\u201d (supposedly \nto stand for the \u201cComponent-Oriented Object Language,\u201d although opinions vary now) and later \nrenamed \u201cC#.\u201d\nWhile most observers considered C# and the CLR (the Common Language Runtime, the virtual \nmachine executing the bytecode) to be direct competitors of Java, Microsoft took careful steps to \nensure that it was \u201copen\u201d in ways that Java was not: where the JVM was designed from the beginning \nto be a virtual machine for a single language, the CLR embraced a more polyglot approach, with \nMicrosoft even going so far as to recruit several universities and companies to create new languages \nfor this platform ", "and/or adapt existing ones. This project, nicknamed \u201cProject 7\u201d (for the 7 groups \nthat participated), debuted several of these languages during .NET\u2019s introduction, and included CLR \nflavors of Eiffel, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of these languages gained any traction after the first \nfew years of existence, and most no longer exist, but their presence had the effect on Microsoft of \n\u201ckeeping them honest\u201d with respect to other languages beyond C# and Visual Basic as the platform \ngrew and evolved. (Microsoft itself would later go on to introduce a number of new CLR-based \nlanguages, including a compiled-to-binary version of ECMAScript, two different efforts at bringing \nmanaged coding to C++, a hybrid object/functional language called F#, and several more research \nlanguages.)\nHowever, Microsoft also sought to make sure that .NET was not a proprietary effort by investing \nthousands of man-hours into the creation of a series of international specifications\u2014through the \nEuropean Comput", "er Manufacturer\u2019s Association (ECMA2)\u2014to ensure that C# and the underlying \nplatform were both open industry standards. C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and the \nunderlying runtime was given the name the \u201cCommon Language Infrastructure\u201d (CLI), and accepted \nand ratified as ECMA-335. Intel, HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in \nkeeping these specifications up to date with changes to the language and the platform, the most \nrecent updates3 coming in 2012 for the CLI and 2017 for C#.\nWith the introduction of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpected side-effect: members of \nthe open-source community began to examine building a \u201cclean-room\u201d implementation of them. \nWhile the CLI Specification didn\u2019t include any of the Windows-specific features (such as a deep COM \nintegration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution for their existing \ndeveloper base, the CLI Specification itself provided enough integration points to mak", "e it interesting \nto implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one such project, calling \nit Mono.\nThe specification also gave Microsoft some room to do what some within the company had been \nlooking to do for quite a while: provide a research and experimentation vehicle for the academic and \nresearch communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripped-down version of the CLR \nsource code, code-named \u201cRotor,\u201d distributed under an open-source license they created, called the \n2 ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification for the language commonly known as \u201cJavaScript,\u201d but is \nmore rightly called \u201cECMAScript,\u201d governed as ECMA-262.\n3 CLI: https://www.iso.org/standard/58046.html and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/\nEcma-335.htm; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm.NET for Java Developers 7\n\u201cShared Source\u201d license, giving it the formal name \u201cShared Source CLI\u201d or \u201cSSCLI.\u201d While Mo", "no would \nremain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, and Rotor of even less interest to \nthose outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source mindset were sown. Over time, Mono \nwould be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own company, Xamarin, which would faithfully \nparallel the work described by the specifications and periodically try out new ideas for the open\u0002source community to consider.\nMicrosoft officially released the first version of C# and the CLR in 2002, and new versions came \nroughly three years apart after that: C# 2.0 in 2005, and C# 3.0 in 2008. Each was contained in a \nproduct release of Visual Studio, such that C# 2.0 and version 2.0 of the CLR runtime was released \nwith Visual Studio 2005, and C# 3.0 and CLR 3.5 came with Visual Studio 2008. Microsoft then shifted \nto a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, and most \nrecently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the versions of C# ", "and the CLR started falling out of lockstep \nwith Visual Studio, deliberately, for a couple of reasons.\nThe first was that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, and was starting to \nunbundle its various parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independent, parts. F#, which \nfirst shipped \u201cout of the box\u201d in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to start down the open\u0002source path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project, it had never really \nembraced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place. Microsoft started \nworking shortly thereafter on an open-source rewrite of its entire compiler toolchain, code-named \n\u201cRoslyn.\u201d By the time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem were starting to ship \nindependently, with Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for developers to gather the parts \nof the ecosystem they desired more easily. Open-source package management (called Nu", "Get), which \nbegan life well outside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated into Visual Studio so that \nNuGet came \u201cout of the box,\u201d much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java IDEs.\nMono, meanwhile, had started to gain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular, the \ngaming toolkit Unity had expressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running \ninside the Unity toolkit. Unity-based games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the \nJavaScript-on-.NET implementation that Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a Python\u0002inspired .NET language called Boo. Additionally, the open-source community produced another .NET \nimplementation, the .NET Micro Framework, specifically aimed at embedded software systems and \nsmall-scale hardware such as the Arduino platform.\nAll of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, Microsoft announced that the source \nfor ASP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to anyon", "e who wanted to look at it. It \nwasn\u2019t full open-source yet, though, in that they weren\u2019t accepting pull requests. It was, however, \nan important step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It announced that it would completely \nopen-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making it available to any platform and accept \npull requests from any developer so inclined. A new .NET implementation would be completely \nopen-source and hosted on GitHub, called .NET Core. It also announced the creation of the .NET \nFoundation, an industry consortium of groups dedicated to the growth of the .NET platform, in .NET for Java Developers 8\nmuch the same fashion that the Java Community Process governs the continued growth of the Java \nplatform4.\nTo be sure, Microsoft made some missteps along the way, and definitely learned a few hard lessons \nabout its relationship with the open-source community, but by late 2017, Microsoft was statistically \nthe biggest contributor on GitHub (measured", " in terms of total numbers of contributors5), and all \nof its key components\u2014language, runtime, libraries, and many of its tools\u2014were available for \ndownload on GitHub.\nMicrosoft also started to get more serious about the cross-platform/portability aspects of the .NET \necosystem. Xamarin, which by 2009 had started producing tools that could cross-compile .NET \nbytecode into native applications for iOS and Android platforms (the catchy-named \u201cMonoDroid\u201d \nand less-catchy \u201cMono for iOS\u201d toolkits), was flourishing, and Microsoft realized that a practical story \nfor being able to share non-UI portions of code across multiple platforms was necessary if they \nwanted to avoid developer confusion.\nWhile the ECMA Specifications had discussed different \u201cprofiles\u201d for levels of .NET standardization, \nthese profiles were in many ways similar to their \u201cJava Standard Edition,\u201d \u201cJava Micro Edition,\u201d and \n\u201cJava Enterprise Edition\u201d cousins\u2014a little unwieldy in a number of ways, but most notably in that ", "\nthere wasn\u2019t really a good way to guarantee compatibility across platforms and implementation \nversions\u2014if code is compiled by the Java6 compiler, it is safe to assume that it will continue to run on \nthe Java6 virtual machine from whence it was compiled, but the Java APIs do change from release to \nrelease, and this has tripped up the unwary Java developer from time to time.\nThus, in 2016, Microsoft announced the \u201c.NET Standard 1.0\u201d profile, a collection not of relatively \nvague implementation documents, but an actual API standard, such that a developer who sought \nto build a library that could be used by a variety of different platforms (across a certain number of \nversions of that platform, even) could know that anything that implemented .NET Standard 1.0 would \nbe able to consume that library, regardless of where that code is running\u2014on a web server, on a \nmobile device, or even on somebody\u2019s VR helmet (running a 3D interactive application written with \nUnity).\nWhich brings us, no", "w, to the current day. \n4 Ironically, Microsoft\u2019s move to the .NET Foundation comes at the same time Oracle is looking to move \naway from the JCP; both companies have experience with standards organizations, and neither wants to see \ninnovation stifled in committee.\n5 http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-open-source-2016-9.NET for Java Developers 9\nHello, strange new world\nTo the Java developer, this is a strange, strange world compared to the one they glimpsed into back \nin 2000.\nFor starters, the Java world looks wildly different than it once did. Sun no longer exists, acquired \nby Oracle. Oracle and Google squabble in the courtroom over the legal implications of Java on \nAndroid devices. Spring was acquired, then spun out into its own company, Pivotal. JBoss absorbed \ninto Red Hat. IBM no longer really even tries to push Java much anymore. Does anybody even \nremember EJB? Or that it was once \u201ca thing\u201d? Who would\u2019ve guessed any of this back in 2001?\nBut meanwhile, over in ", "the Microsoft world, a new CEO runs the firm, and he has made it clear that \nMicrosoft is an open-source player. A new player, to be sure, and still finding its feet in a variety of \nways, but one committed to the open-source community. In addition to the strides it has made with \n.NET, Microsoft has opened Azure up to almost every mainstream language and platform\u2014including \nJava. (Yes, you can run Tomcat and MySQL in an Azure cloud cluster.) SQL Server has been ported \nto Linux. Windows Server can be loaded into a Docker container, and Microsoft works with the \nDocker community to bring Docker-on-Windows up to the same level of sublime that it has on other \nplatforms.\nWithin the .NET ecosystem, the .NET Standard, now at a 2.0 release, provides an umbrella of \nguaranteed compatibility across three major platforms of this writing: the Windows-based .NET \nFramework (which contains the necessary libraries for building Windows client applications, for \nexample), .NET Core (intended for the", " cross-platform server world, including Docker containers \nand cloud-native targets), and Xamarin (principally aimed at the iOS and Android world, but also \nproviding bindings for building macOS applications). Unity has joined the .NET Foundation and \nexpects to be aligned with the various versions of .NET Standard by mid-2018.\nAll of which means that it\u2019s not a bad time to start exploring this world in more depth..NET for Java Developers 10\nGetting Started: Tooling\nGetting started with .NET depends pretty heavily on your choice of operating system and, to a lesser \ndegree, the development experience you want. As mentioned earlier, Visual Studio supports both \nWindows and macOS, as well as a variety of Linux distributions, which pretty much covers everybody. \nIn this section, the goal is to get tools installed, a basic introduction to the major project artifacts, \nand, of course, build the traditional \u201cHelloWorld.\u201d Once we\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ll talk a little bit about \nwhat we\u2019re produci", "ng, and the package system for .NET (called NuGet).\nHello, web?\nIf you\u2019re just looking to flirt a little with the C# language but don\u2019t want to commit any disk space \nto the idea, one of the easiest ways to explore the language is the online interactive browser-based \ntutorial found at https://aka.ms/csharpquickstarts. \nHowever, doing so will run into a whole slew of limitations to your exploration, so sooner or later \nyou\u2019re probably going to want to commit some disk space. \nDocker all the things!\nIf you\u2019re a Docker enthusiast, and you want to get the quickest path possible to working with .NET, \nfire up a Microsoft-maintained .NET Core Docker container by running: \ndocker run -it microsoft/dotnet bash\nThis will pull the latest version of Microsoft\u2019s Docker Hub\u2013stored Docker images, and drop you into \na shell prompt from which you can run the \u201cdotnet\u201d CLI tool. When you are ready to edit some files, \nrun the Docker image with a volume mount to a host\u2019s local directory, and use your fa", "vorite editor\u2014\nmight we suggest Visual Studio Code?\u2014to edit the .NET Core\u2013generated files we\u2019re about to create.\nLinux .NET?\nAs with most things Linux, installation instructions depend on which flavor of Linux you\u2019re running.\nRed Hat is the easiest install, since Microsoft and Red Hat have partnered on a few things in the past, \nso the .NET Core packages are in the Red Hat distribution channels; assuming you are using the \nRed Hat Subscription Manager, two commands get .NET Core on your machine:\nyum install rh-dotnet20 -y\nscl enable rh-dotnet20 bash.NET for Java Developers 11\nAt that point, the \u201cdotnet\u201d tool should be in your PATH and good to go.\nIf you\u2019re on Ubuntu, there\u2019s a bit more work required. While Microsoft is working to get the .NET \nCore packages into the standard Ubuntu distribution channels, at the time of this writing that hasn\u2019t \nhappened completely, so Ubuntu users will need to add Microsoft\u2019s key and Ubuntu-release-specific \nURL into the list of sources the Ubuntu apt-", "get utilities check for packages. Full details are on the \n.NET Core website at www.dot.net/core; once that\u2019s done, however, apt-get can install the \u201cdotnet\u0002sdk-2.1.101\u201d package onto the system, and this will get the \u201cdotnet\u201d tool in the PATH and good to go.\nThis \u201cregister the channel\u201d followed by \u201cuse the standard package manager\u201d is actually the same \nstory for Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, and Debian; again, full step-by-step instructions are on the \n.NET Core \u201cGetting Started\u201d page (https://aka.ms/dotnet-getstarted-linux), which has a drop-down \nto choose between the six flavors of Linux that .NET Core supports. Add the Microsoft feed to the \npackage manager, use the package manager to do the install, and the \u201cdotnet\u201d tool should be \navailable on the PATH. \nOnce that\u2019s done, .NET Core is ready to go.\nVisual Studio Code\nFor almost any operating system you might find yourself using, including most of the popular \ndistributions of Linux, Microsoft has a lightweight editor called Visual St", "udio Code. If you\u2019ve been \ndoing a lot of web front-end work, you may already have been using it. In many ways, it\u2019s the latest \nattempt at building an \u201ceditor-plus-plug-ins\u201d tool, and it is gaining some traction with the world \noutside the Microsoft ecosystem. (It\u2019s actually the preferred tool for working with Google\u2019s open\u0002source Angular project, among other things.) It\u2019s also available from http://code.visualstudio.com, \nit\u2019s available for Windows, macOS, and most of the major flavors of Linux, and it\u2019s a pretty quick \ndownload and install. And, honestly, it\u2019s not a bad editor for writing Java code, in case you were \nwondering; check out the Java extensions at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/extensions the \nnext time you\u2019re looking for a lightweight editor that understands Java projects. \nFiring up Visual Studio Code from the command-line is often just a simple \u201ccode\u201d if you\u2019re in the root \ndirectory of your project..NET for Java Developers 12\nMac .NET?\nIf you\u2019re like a lot ", "of Java developers (myself included), you own a macOS machine. It might surprise \nyou to know that many of the developers at Microsoft do, too. (Some of them repaved it with \nWindows, but a lot of them run native macOS.) Doing .NET on macOS falls into one of two options.\nOne is the command-line approach, which you can obtain via Homebrew. For the moment, using \nHomebrew requires tapping a cask, but after that, it\u2019s as simple as doing the classic \u201cbrew install\u201d \nthing:\n$ brew tap caskroom/cask #if you haven't already\n$ brew cask install dotnet-sdk\nThis will run a custom installer script that will put .NET Core onto your machine, so it\u2019s not completely \nHomebrew-friendly, but it \u201cdoes the job.\u201d Once finished, fire up a new Terminal window (to pick up \nthe environment changes that the installer makes) and run:\n$ dotnet --version\n2.1.1.NET for Java Developers 13\nWhich should respond with \u201c2.<something>,\u201d depending on which version is published as of the time \nyou read this.\nIf you\u2019re a bit", " more of an IDE fan, however, you\u2019re still in luck. With its acquisition of Xamarin, \nMicrosoft also acquired Xamarin\u2019s IDE for the Mac, which was just recently re-branded to be called \n\u201cVisual Studio for Mac.\u201d Based on the open-source \u201cMonoDevelop\u201d project, it\u2019s not quite as extensive \nan IDE experience as Visual Studio, owing to a smaller set of plug-ins developed for it, but that can \nactually make it more enjoyable to use sometimes, particularly if all you\u2019re looking for is a good \neditor, project management system, and debugger.\nInstalling Visual Studio for Mac is a pretty straightforward experience\u2014http://visualstudio.com has \na link for an installer that, when opened, will go through the usual Mac installation process. There \nare a number of options here that aren\u2019t absolutely necessary for our purposes, but since a complete \ninstall is measured only in single-digit gigabytes of disk space, unless you\u2019re constrained for space, \nwhy not just keep it simple and install it all?.NET", " for Java Developers 14\nOnce started, take a few minutes to grab some coffee; like its cousin on Windows, Visual Studio \nfor Mac will download the components it needs and install them to disk. Don\u2019t walk away from the \nmachine for too long, however\u2014the installer will ask for the administrator password several times \nduring the installation.\nWindows: Visual Studio\nLastly, if you\u2019re running Windows, the most obvious option is installing Visual Studio\u2014that \ncombination has been the default for Windows-based development for close to two decades, and \nmost Java developers know enough already to realize that. What many don\u2019t realize is that there is a \nfree-to-download \u201cCommunity Edition\u201d that has all the core parts of the IDE and toolchain: compiler, \ndebugger, editor, project management, and so on. You can find the Visual Studio Community \nEdition via your favorite search engine or wander on over to http://visualstudio.com to grab an \ninstaller. Make sure you\u2019re on a good Internet connecti", "on, since 98% of the install is coming from the \nMicrosoft servers.\nWhen the Visual Studio installer fires up, it immediately becomes obvious that this is every bit as \nlarge of an installation as Eclipse or IDEA\u2014hundreds of options lie before you. While most of them \nare not necessary (many of them have to do with building unmanaged C++ code, for example, or \nfor building game projects), selecting all of them will help ensure that anything you might look to \nexplore will be available to you. The total install size is about the same as your favorite Java IDE \nwith all the trimmings, when all is said and done. Alternatively, you can select just \u201c.NET Core Cross\u0002platform development\u201d for a streamlined install of just .NET Core. .NET for Java Developers 15\nIf all of this seems a little hard to remember, honestly, you\u2019re not wrong. Remember, Microsoft is \nfairly new to this \u201cmake it work on all platforms\u201d story, and they\u2019re constantly trying to improve the \nwhole experience, which in the p", "ast has resulted in some churn and confusion. One of the things \nthey\u2019ve done in 2017 is to try to collect all their .NET-related resources together into a single URL for \neasy reference. That URL, www.dot.net, is the place to start, and will end up redirecting to the main \nMicrosoft site dedicated to the .NET ecosystem. It\u2019s an overview of all the different things one can do \nwith .NET, as well as the different platform installers. Probably the most useful things are the button\u0002links to \u201cGet Started\u201d and \u201cDownload\u201d; the latter takes you to a collection of different download \nlinks, and the former takes you to a series of tutorial steps to getting started building a console \n\u201cHelloWorld\u201d application. (Sounds familiar, no?)\nHello, dotnet: CLI style\nRegardless of how you\u2019ve got the command-line tooling on your machine, it all boils down to one \nthing: The machine has a command-line tool called \u201cdotnet\u201d that\u2019s in the PATH and hooked up to an \nInternet connection. Away we go.\nThe \u201cdotnet\u201d ", "tool, in many ways, is a re-examination of the thought process that Maven brought into \nthe world: a command-line tool that can generate out a project based on customizable/extensible \ntemplates stored in the cloud, as well as act as a single point-of-control for building, running, \ntesting, and any other commands that need to happen to a given project. The \u201cdotnet\u201d tool hides a \nfair amount of .NET Core\u2019s machinery, in the same way that Maven hides a fair amount of the Java \nmachinery (CLASSPATH references, for example), so keep in mind that we\u2019re only looking at the tip of \nthe iceberg as we work with this. (Make no mistake\u2014the tooling here goes just as deep and just as \nwide as anything we\u2019ve ever used in the Java world, and it\u2019s just as easy to get lost in it if we dive too \ndeeply into it too quickly.)\nTo start a .NET Core application, we can use \u201cdotnet\u201d to generate a project based on the \u201cconsole\u201d \napplication template, like so:\n$ dotnet new console -o HelloWorld\nThis will gener", "ate a \u201cconsole\u201d project into the directory \u201cHelloWorld\u201d; for those who are curious, \n\u201cdotnet new\u201d by itself, or \u201cdotnet new --list,\u201d will list all of the project templates that the \u201cdotnet\u201d \ncommand knows about. Out of the box, it has about a dozen or so project templates, including \nconsole applications, class libraries, a half-dozen flavors of web projects, and so on. This list is \nexpected to grow and evolve as time goes on, just as the list of Maven archetypes grew after its \nrelease. Note that the list also allows generation of projects across different languages, so those who \nreally want to sneak a peek at what an F# Web API project would look like can run:\n$ dotnet new webapi -o HelloFSAPI -lang F#\nASP.NET Web API will be discussed in a little more detail later in this paper; however interesting, \nthough, F# is not something we\u2019re going to explore here. You can learn more at fsharp.org. .NET for Java Developers 16\nImplicit in the \u201cnew\u201d command is a request to download all of th", "e dependencies that a project \nrequires, which in \u201cdotnet\u201d parlance is a command to \u201crestore.\u201d This requests all of the dependent \nassemblies\u2014JAR file equivalents, essentially\u2014from a Maven-like, cloud-based service called \nNuGet. NuGet was heavily inspired by Maven and Ruby gems, which means, for the most part, it \nworks the same way Maven does\u2014when doing a \u201cdotnet restore,\u201d the machine must be connected \nto the Internet, and depending on the size of the project, could take a while to download all the \ndependencies.\nOnce the project has been \u201crestore\u201dd, all of the dependencies are downloaded, and the application \ncan be run by using \u201cdotnet run\u201d from within the project directory. This will, not surprisingly, print \n\u201cHello World!\u201d to the terminal. If outside of the project directory, tell \u201cdotnet\u201d which project to run \nby passing a reference to the project file (HelloWorld.csproj6) in via the \u201c--project\u201d command-line \nargument:\n$ dotnet run --project HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj\nHello W", "orld!\nIf you\u2019re inside the project directory, this becomes a simple \u201cdotnet run\u201d; .NET assemblies know their \nentry point intrinsically.\nIf you\u2019re feeling curious, poke into the \u201cbin/Debug\u201d directory underneath HelloWorld; in it resides the \ngenerated compiler artifacts, including the .NET assembly, \u201cHelloWorld.dll,\u201d and its debugger support \nfile, \u201cHelloWorld.pdb.\u201d It may seem strange that one would \u201cexecute\u201d a DLL, but an assembly, like a \nJAR file, is a repository of bytecode (but with much tighter cohesion than a JAR file provides), and the \nextension is (for the most part) almost entirely irrelevant. The dotnet launcher serves much the same \npurpose as the Java launcher does: to find the assembly specified on the command-line, load it, then \nexecute the entry point method and get out of the way.\nHello, .NET: IDE style\nIf Visual Studio (or Visual Studio for Mac) has finished installing, fire it up, and either select \u201cFile | New \nProject,\u201d or use the Start Page displayed in the cent", "er of the IDE to begin a new project by clicking \none of the \u201cNew Project\u201d templates. Depending on which Visual Studio you\u2019re running, you may be \npresented with two kinds of console applications: one that represents a native Console Application \n(for Windows, it will reference .NET Framework) and one that targets .NET Core (that\u2019s the open\u0002source implementation). Choose either one (I prefer .NET Core), then do the usual IDE thing of \nchoosing which directory in which the project should live, and its name. Note that we can designate \nthis as a Git repository as well. Once finished, Visual Studio will think for a bit, then show the finished \ntemplate, complete with C# code, ready for editing, building, and debugging.\n6 The .NET Core tooling took a bit of a detour recently through the world of JSON by working off of a \u201cproject.\njson\u201d file, which is still mentioned in a number of .NET Core tutorials; that has been deprecated in favor of the \nMSBuild-based files, and is no longer supported", ". JSON is still used for a number of configuration files, but the \n.NET community reacted pretty strongly to the use of JSON for the project files, and Microsoft, looking to be a \ngood open-source steward, responded to that feedback by backtracking and moving back to MSBuild..NET for Java Developers 17\nBuilding the code (Ctrl-Shift-B on Windows, Command-B on macOS) produces a console application \n(a native Windows .exe for Windows or a .NET Core project for macOS), which can either be built by \nnavigating to the \u201cDebug/bin\u201d subdirectory of the project and running it directly or by launching it \nfrom within Visual Studio..NET for Java Developers 18\nThe debugger works the same as it does within any IDE, and Visual Studio has its share of rich \ndebugger tricks (which are really beyond the scope of this article, but easy to find https://aka.ms/\nvsdebugger). HelloWorld, achievement unlocked.\nSolutions and projects\nWithin the Visual Studio ecosystem, code is arranged into \u201cprojects,\u201d which a", "re in turn collected \ninto \u201csolutions.\u201d A project is language-specific, and sports an XML file whose extension reflects that \nlanguage\u2014C# projects are stored in \u201c.csproj\u201d files, for example. Each project produces one artifact\u2014\nan assembly, which we\u2019ll discuss in more detail later. Solutions, then, are made up of any number \nof projects listed in a solution file (.sln), making it quite common for a solution to have some top\u0002level \u201cexecutable\u201d (whether that is a website project, Web API project, or some form of GUI project) \nwith one or more \u201clibrary\u201d projects to support it. It\u2019s extremely common, in fact, to see projects in \nseparate subdirectories under the directory in which the solution file lives. This arrangement won\u2019t \nseem strange to the working Java developer; in many respects, this is no different from what we \nwould see in a Java codebase, where some collection of code (project) produces a JAR file, and a \nMaven or Gradle build (solution) brings it all together into a bundle o", "f some form.\nMicrosoft is working to keep all these file types in sync across all versions of Visual Studio, so that \na project that builds on Visual Studio for Mac should also build on Windows, using an underlying \nbuild system called \u201cMSBuild.\u201d Heavily Ant-inspired, MSBuild has been the build system for .NET since .NET for Java Developers 19\nVisual Studio 2005, and Xamarin was quick to adopt it for their project file system when they started \nbuilding out their toolchain. \nGoodbye, HelloWorld\nTooling is now installed. The Gods of Computer Science have been appeased by the creation of a \nsuccessful HelloWorld application. It\u2019s time to take a pass across the C# language..NET for Java Developers 20\nC#, Succinctly\nWhile we can\u2019t cover the entirety of the C# language in half a dozen pages, we can cover the key \nconcepts of C# pretty quickly. In fact, we can do it in one sentence: C# is an object-oriented language \nthat borrows heavily from its lexical ancestors, C++ and Java, and from oth", "er \u201ccomponent\u201d-oriented \nlanguages such as Delphi. In recent years, C# (like most languages) has begun to incorporate \nmore functional programming concepts into its syntax, and as a result presents a pretty multi\u0002paradigmatic set of capabilities.\nIn other words, take Java, throw in a number of the features Java developers have debated for a \ndecade or more, then add a bunch of functional programming concepts, stir well, bake for 15 years, \nand serve. Microsoft\u2019s language designers have been much more aggressive than Sun\u2019s when it \ncomes to introducing new features into their respective languages, so for the most part a Java \ndeveloper\u2019s experience with C# will probably be characterized by \u201cOh, sure, that all looks pretty \nsimilar\u2014wait, what is THAT?\u201d\nBy the way, C# currently sits at version 7.2 at the time of this writing, and Microsoft\u2019s language \ndesigners have been just as aggressive in the latest revisions of the language as they were in the \nearly ones. This is a language under co", "nstant evolution, for good or for ill. So there\u2019s much to discuss, \nand we will not be able to cover the entire surface area of the language\u2014the focus here will be only \non those parts that will be unintuitive to the Java developer looking at \u201caverage\u201d C# code.\nC# Basics\nTo begin, let\u2019s take a look at what was generated as part of those \u201cHelloWorld\u201d console applications, \nsince that\u2019s probably the easiest way to get started.\nusing System;\nnamespace HelloDotNet\n{\n class Program\n {\n static void Main(string[] args)\n {\n Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n }\n }\n}\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to spot a number of things right off the bat: C# is a C-family language, using curly\u0002brackets to denote scope blocks and semicolons to terminate statements. Code is organized into .NET for Java Developers 21\nnamespaces using the \u201cnamespace\u201d keyword, and pretty clearly we have classes just as Java does. \nThe Console class (part of the \u201cSystem\u201d namespace) represents the command-line input/output \nfacilities, and Writ", "eLine is obviously a synonym for \u201cprintln.\u201d Square brackets are used to denote an \narray in the same way they do in Java, and arrays in C# work almost exactly the same way as they do \nin Java, save that they have been slightly more \u201cformalized\u201d in that there is a full-blown class, System.\nArray, that defines a number of methods and properties that all arrays will share. Core \u201cprimitive\u201d \ntypes are actually defined as full-blown classes, so that System.Array is the \u201cclass\u201d representing each \narray instance, System.String is the \u201cstring\u201d primitive type, System.Int32 is the \u201cint\u201d primitive type, \nand so on. All types, whether \u201cprimitive\u201d (what .NET calls \u201cvalue types\u201d) or \u201cclass,\u201d all inherit from \nthe base System.Object type, with value types being \u201cboxed\u201d to objects when necessary. (This was \nthe inspiration for autoboxing rules in Java5, in fact.) As a result, \u201cSystem.String s\u201d and \u201cstring s\u201d are \nactually entirely equivalent declarations. New value types can be defined, but it\u2019s prett", "y rare.\nLet\u2019s start with some of the more straightforward parts of the language.\nStarting exploration: classes, properties, \nand methods\nC# 1.0 was, in large measure, a near-direct clone of Java, with some keyword changes and some new \nfeatures that Java has debated for years: explicit properties and delegates (an early form of lambda \nexpressions). Thus, we can write the traditional \u201cPerson\u201d type in C# like so:\nclass Person\n{\n public string FirstName\n {\n get { return this.firstName; }\n set { this.firstName = value; }\n }\n private string firstName;\n public string LastName\n {\n get { return this.lastName; }\n set { this.lastName = value; }\n }\n private string lastName;\n public int Age\n {\n get { return this.age; }\n set { this.age = value; }.NET for Java Developers 22\n }\n private int age;\n public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n {\n this.FirstName = fn;\n this.LastName = ln;\n this.Age = a;\n }\n}\nProperties can be read-only by eliminating the \u201cset\u201d clause, and write-only (if that makes sense,", " \nwhich it rarely does) by eliminating the \u201cget\u201d clause. The implicit parameter to a \u201cset\u201d clause is always \ncalled \u201cvalue,\u201d and there are no restrictions to what a property-get or property-set clause can do \nwithin its body, although 95% of the time they simply read and write a field within the class.\nSo far, if anything, it seems more verbose than Java. However, that was the C# language as of 15 \nyears ago\u2014they\u2019ve made a few changes along the way.\nOne very common change is to the requirement to actually provide a body to the property-get and \nproperty-set clauses; as is the case in Java, 95% of the time these clauses simply wrap around a field \nand provide encapsulated access and nothing else. Which means, frankly, that the time spent writing \nthe implementation for these is pretty much a waste of time (and something that IDEA or other IDEs \ncan generate for us). The C# language designers agreed, and in C# 3.0 added the concept of \u201cauto\u0002implemented properties,\u201d which asks the C# comp", "iler to not only generate the property method \nimplementations, but also synthesize the field used for the backing store. This simplifies the Person \nclass down to:\nclass Person\n{\n public string FirstName { get; set; }\n public string LastName { get; set; }\n public int Age { get; set; }\n public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n {\n this.FirstName = fn;\n this.LastName = ln;\n this.Age = a;\n }\n}.NET for Java Developers 23\nThat\u2019s\u2026awfully terse. But what about those scenarios where we want to have the property available \nto be read by anyone (public access), but only accessible for mutation from within the class (private \naccess)? The get and set clauses can have different levels of access, the most common idiom being:\nclass Person\n{\n public string FirstName { get; private set; }\n public string LastName { get; private set; }\n public int Age { get; private set; }\n public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n {\n this.FirstName = fn;\n this.LastName = ln;\n this.Age = a;\n }\n}\nThis will effective", "ly make the fields immutable from the outside yet still something we can \nchange from the interior of the class. The field itself is synthesized by the compiler (usually with \na straightforward name such as \u201c__$<Person>$<FirstName>@5417,\u201d or something equally non\u0002obvious), and won\u2019t be directly accessible by code. (Granted, one can always use System.Reflection\u2014\nthe .NET direct equivalent to Java\u2019s java.lang.reflect package\u2014to access the field at runtime, but \nthat\u2019s an awful lot of work to work around something that can be discarded at any time.) For those \nrare situations where the auto-generated properties don\u2019t do the right thing, C# developers can \nalways \u201cdrop back\u201d to writing the property clauses out longhand and wrapping a declared field.\nMethods, meanwhile, work pretty much the same way they do in Java, in terms of their declaration \nand syntax. Methods can be instance methods or static (although static method invocations must \nalways go through the class name, whereas Java wil", "l allow calling a static method through an \ninstance variable\u2014seriously, try it, it\u2019s weird), and parameters are declared in order with a type and a \nname:\npublic class Person\n{\n public string FirstName { get; set; }\n public string LastName { get; set; }\n public int Age { get; set; }\n public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\n {.NET for Java Developers 24\n this.FirstName = fn;\n this.LastName = ln;\n this.Age = a;\n }\n public void SayHello(string recipient)\n {\n Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, {0}, I, {1}, say hello.\",\n recipient, FirstName);\n }\n}\nclass Program\n{\n static void Main(string[] args)\n {\n Person p = new Person(\"Ted\", \"Neward\", 46);\n p.SayHello(\"Fred\");\n }\n}\nAs you can see, C# follows pretty much exactly the same rules that Java does for method declaration \nand invocation. But, again, C# allows for some interesting variations on this theme.\nFor starters, C# has had the concept of \u201cmethod literals\u201d since 1.0, though the syntax has changed \nover each successive revision of the language.", " The first step was \u201cdelegates,\u201d essentially the ability \nto declare a method signature and then assign methods-on-object-instances to a given delegate \ninstance, like so:\nclass Person\n{\n // . . .\n public delegate void HelloProc(string recipient);\n public HelloProc IndirectSayHello;\n}\nclass Program\n{\n static void Main(string[] args)\n {\n Person p = new Person(\"Ted\", \"Neward\", 46);\n p.SayHello(\"Fred\");\n p.IndirectSayHello = p.SayHello;\n p.IndirectSayHello(\"Fred\");\n }\n}.NET for Java Developers 25\nThis was a pretty verbose way of doing method-reference-capture, and with successive versions of \nC#, they simplified it, particularly once the .NET platform introduced generics. (Yes, C# has generics, \nyes they look syntactically almost identical to Java generics, but no, they don\u2019t work the same way \nwhen compiled\u2014where Java uses \u201ctype erasure,\u201d C# uses \u201creified generics\u201d and persists the generic \ndefinition all the way into the compiled bytecode.) The \u201cdelegate\u201d keyword here introduces a new \n", "type\u2014a function pointer, if you will\u2014and we can declare an instance of the delegate on the Person \nclass, assign a method to it, and invoke the assigned method through that delegate.\nLambdas, type inference, and extension classes\nBy the time C# 3.0 came around, however, C# supported full-bore lambda syntax, complete with \nmethod parameter type inference, so that we could write method literals in-line:\n p.IndirectSayHello = (recipient) => {\n Console.WriteLine(\"Hey, {0}. Whatever.\", recipient);\n };\n p.IndirectSayHello(\"Shaggy\");\nLambdas turned out to be a major turning point within the C# language, along with several other \nfeatures of the C# 3.0 release, including local variable type inference, which simply allows for the \nkeyword \u201cvar\u201d to appear in place of the type in a local variable declaration, like so:\n var x = 12;\n var y = \"Fred\";\n var z = p.IndirectSayHello;\n z(\"Wilma\");\nThe \u201cvar\u201d keyword does not, as some in the Java world theorized at its introduction, create an \nuntyped varia", "ble; the C# compiler simply infers the variable\u2019s type from the right-hand-side \nexpression, and assigns that to the variable type. Thus, the \u201cx\u201d variable is strongly typed as an \ninteger (since that is an integer literally on the right-hand side), \u201cy\u201d is a string, and \u201cz\u201d is a delegate \nthat accepts a method reference that takes a single string parameter and returns void. All the \n\u201cvar\u201d keyword does, simply, is allow the C# developer a brief respite from having to type out type \nsignatures in places where the compiler could figure it out on its own.\nOn top of this, Microsoft also introduced a fascinating feature called \u201cextension classes,\u201d which has \nfound its way into other languages such as Swift. In short, a class can write \u201cextension methods\u201d \nthat can effectively \u201cinject\u201d themselves as method declarations onto other classes, adding new \nfunctionality to classes already compiled. (It\u2019s vaguely reminiscent of aspects as described by \nAspectJ, but a strictly limited subset thereof.)", "\nFor example, assume that it\u2019s becoming really common to want to count the number of words in \na given String. In the earliest days of Java, it was assumed that we could extend the String class to \nadd that kind of functionality, but Sun very quickly clamped down on that, made String final, and .NET for Java Developers 26\nearned the (short-lived) wrath of Java developers everywhere. Java developers were forced to write \n\u201cStringUtils\u201d classes that had static methods on them to count the words in a string, similar to this C# \nequivalent:\npublic class StringUtils\n{\n public static int WordCount(String str)\n {\n return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' },\n StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;\n }\n}\nFrankly, though, using this left a pretty bitter taste in everybody\u2019s mouth, since it smacked of doing \nprocedural programming. Java developers just learned to live with it; C# language designers said, \n\u201cWe can go one step better.\u201d If you agree that the class will never have any instan", "ce data and never \nbe instantiated as an instance (declare the class \u201cstatic\u201d), then it can use the first parameter to declare \na \u201cthis\u201d parameter, and essentially declare a method that will appear on the targeted class, like so:\npublic static class MyStringExtensions\n{\n public static int WordCount(this String str)\n {\n return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' },\n StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;\n }\n}\n(Note that \u201cString\u201d is shorthand for \u201cSystem.String,\u201d which is a synonym for the earlier type \u201cstring.\u201d \nAll of the \u201cprimitive types\u201d in C# are aliases for the System-namespaced types, so \u201cint\u201d is the same \nas \u201cSystem.Int32,\u201d and so on. This has to do with how C# allows the declaration of \u201cvalue types,\u201d and \nwhile a fascinating discussion in its own right, it\u2019s a little out-of-scope from what we\u2019re doing here.)\nThis extension class means that now we can write the following:\n var words = \"One two three four\";\n var wordCount = words.WordCount(); // 4\nExtension classes don\u2019t ", "just magically apply everywhere, however\u2014they must be brought into scope \nvia the use of the \u201cusing\u201d statements, so that if we don\u2019t care to use the MyStringExtensions, the \nWordCount() method won\u2019t appear on String types. And the original class remains unaffected, which \nmeans that the WordCount() extension (like all extensions) cannot have any impact on the internals \nof the extended class\u2014in fact, it can\u2019t see any of the internal members, and so can only ever be able \nto use the public interface of the extended class. It\u2019s purely compiler syntactic sugar..NET for Java Developers 27\nLanguage-INtegrated Query (LINQ)\nAll of this led up to one of the signature moments for the C# compiler with the 3.0 release: \nLanguage-INtegrated Query, or LINQ, for short. To many in the Java community, LINQ represented \neverything that was wrong with Microsoft, accusing them of \u201cembedding SQL into the C# language\u201d \nand turning C# into a 4GL that was proprietarily bound to SQL Server. As the Jedi Master", " put it, \n\u201cAmazing\u2014every single part of that sentence is entirely incorrect.\u201d LINQ wasn\u2019t integrating SQL, it \nisn\u2019t about SQL Server, and it\u2019s actually built up around core language principles that had nothing to \ndo with relational databases, much less integrated with SQL Server.\nLet\u2019s start by examining a simple collection of Person objects in a list:\n var people = new List<Person>() {\n new Person(\"Ted\", \"Neward\", 45),\n new Person(\"Charlotte\", \"Neward\", 39),\n new Person(\"Michael\", \"Neward\", 24),\n new Person(\"Matthew\", \"Neward\", 18),\n new Person(\"Beth\", \"Massi\", 39),\n new Person(\"Dustin\", \"Campbell\", 43)\n };\nSuppose I want to give everybody within this list a beer. Sharp readers will notice, of course, that my \nyoungest son is not yet eligible to receive a beer, and this is a family-friendly article, so we don\u2019t want \nto get into trouble with the local authorities.\nWere this a discussion of Java8 lambdas, we would talk about using lambdas and streams to filter \nthe collection before ", "applying a higher-order function across each to give each individual a beer. \n(If that\u2019s new to you, Venkat Subramaniam has some great conference lectures online that describe \nJava8 lambdas in more detail.) As far back as C# 3.0, Microsoft saw the need, and chose not only to \nlayer functional principles into the language, but to put a syntax in place that would actually hide the \nfact that this was ever functional programming in the first place:\n var drinkers =\n from p in people\n where p.Age > 21\n select p;\nThis is a LINQ query expression, and despite the fact that it looks similar to SQL, it\u2019s actually invoking \nseveral functional methods in sequence using a fluent interface; translated out of the SQL-like syntax, \nit looks more like:\n drinkers = people.Where((p) => p.Age > 21);\nAll of the traditional functional operations are present here\u2014map, filter, and the rest\u2014but they \n\u201chide\u201d behind this query expression syntax. We\u2019ll talk more about the interesting features and \nimplications o", "f LINQ when we get to Entity Framework in the last section, but for now, just think of .NET for Java Developers 28\nLINQ as a syntax that is designed to deliberately bring some of the set-oriented nature of SQL and the \nfunctional-oriented nature of languages such as Haskell into the C# language as a first-class citizen.\n(For anybody who really wants to see LINQ taken to an absolute extreme, it can be instructional to \nlook at Luke Hoban\u2019s \u201csingle-LINQ-expression-ray-tracer\u201d blog post from 10 years ago, available at \nhttps://aka.ms/linqraytracer. It will send chills down your back, one way or another.)\nAsynchronous programming with Async/Await\nC# 4.0 introduced a number of interesting features, but C# 5.0 truly bucked the status quo by \nintroducing language support for a form of asynchronous programming via the \u201casync\u201d and \u201cawait\u201d \nkeywords. While not a general-purpose, all-around concurrency feature, async/await added the \nability to easily add \u201clittle concurrency\u201d into common programm", "ing tasks such as issuing a request \nfor a database query or executing a Web API request without having to manually manage the \nthreads necessary to do so without blocking. Leveraging some work done elsewhere on the .NET \nplatform (the Task Parallel Library, or TPL), C# essentially now allows developers to start some work \nand return a Task<T> object, which represents that additional work. At the source code level, \u201casync\u201d \ncan decorate either a method signature or an anonymous method literal to indicate it should run \nasynchronously, and \u201cawait\u201d tells the compiler to generate the code necessary to hold things in place \nuntil the asynchronous code completes. (Essentially, these are language-level implementations of \n\u201cpromises,\u201d which are permeating the JavaScript world and slowly starting to gather steam in the Java \nworld as well, under the name \u201cCompletableFuture\u201d out of the java.util.concurrent package in Java8.)\nasync Task PlaySongsAsync(int[] ids)\n{\n foreach (var id in ids)\n {\n tr", "y\n {\n var data = await service.GetEncodedDataAsync(id);\n var song = await Task.Run(() => Decode(data));\n await PlayAsync(song);\n }\n catch (Exception e) { /* just skip the song */ }\n }\n}\nThere is much, much more we can discuss with respect to C#, but then we\u2019d have no time to talk \nabout anything else, and there is much, much more to go over on our tour. Fortunately, Microsoft has \na great collection of web resources on the language, starting with a page that lists an overall history \nof the language, available at https://aka.ms/csharpwhatsnew, and a general (if abbreviated) overview \nof the language available at https://aka.ms/csharptour. And, of course, there\u2019re books. Lots and lots \nof books. \nBut once you know how to write code in this language, what can you do with it?.NET for Java Developers 29\nFrameworks, for the Win!\nBy far and away, the most popular thing to do with C# and the .NET runtime is to build a web \napplication of some form, just as it is with the Java language and run", "time. To be sure, the .NET \necosystem supports more than this\u2014one can build desktop applications, mobile applications, and \neven games (using the aforementioned Unity framework, among others), but the lion\u2019s share of code \nwritten in C# is web applications.\nLike its twin, .NET offers a comprehensive framework of web functionality, ranging all the way \nfrom drag-and-drop-built user interface, to MVC-based server-side rendering, to the construction \nof HTTP-based APIs for invocation by single-page applications written in JavaScript or mobile \napplications. Somewhat confusingly, however, all three are referred to by the name \u201cASP.NET.\u201d\n(Note to those who recognize the \u201cASP\u201d moniker from the early days of the Sun/Microsoft rivalry: In \nthe COM days, Microsoft\u2019s web technology was called \u201cActive Server Pages,\u201d ASP for short, named \nafter ActiveX, one of the marketing names for COM. When Microsoft started working on the CLR \ninternally, one of its most important consumers was the ASP team, w", "ho sought to create a system \nsimilar to JSP to replace ASP. Since the effort was to redo ASP in .NET, the name \u201cASP.NET\u201d was \ncoined. However, aside from the basic notion that \u201cthis is for the web,\u201d there\u2019s little to no relationship \nbetween ASP.NET and its predecessor.)\nThe ASP.NET \u201cfamily\u201d is fundamentally broken into three parts, two of which we\u2019ll examine here (in \nbrief):\n\u2022 ASP.NET WebForms, the first flavor of ASP.NET, released with .NET 1.0, featuring drag-and-drop \nuser interface construction. It was designed to try to bring a VisualBasic-style design philosophy \nto the web, but by .NET 3.0, the Microsoft community had come to understand the design \nadvantages of an MVC-style design approach, and all work on WebForms essentially ceased. \nIronically, about the time that interest in WebForms was ending, the Java community was building \nup JSF, the equivalent to WebForms in Java.\n\u2022 ASP.NET MVC: Based on the classic \u201cModel-View-Controller\u201d principles that the Sun \u201cModel 2\u201d \ndesign", " for servlets and JSP first laid out, Microsoft created ASP.NET MVC, released the source code \nfor it shortly after its initial release, and has considered this to be its first-class server-side web \nframework ever since. ASP.NET MVC was rebranded (and refactored) to be \u201cASP.NET Core MVC\u201d in \n2015, in keeping with the \u201c.NET Core\u201d naming for the cross-platform runtime, and has made some \nconceptual shifts as new frameworks\u2014such as Ruby-on-Rails\u2014gained popularity and created \nsome new patterns (such as routing tables)..NET for Java Developers 30\n\u2022 ASP.NET MVC Web API: While the name certainly gets no points for brevity, it does accurately \nreflect the idea that this framework is built off of the same concepts that underlie the ASP.NET \nMVC library, but with the intent of producing JSON data instead of HTML. When ASP.NET MVC was \ntagged with the \u201cCore\u201d moniker, the \u201cMVC\u201d was formally dropped from Web API projects, so that \nnow they are simply \u201cASP.NET Core Web API,\u201d or more informally, \u201cW", "eb API\u201d projects.\nLet\u2019s have a look at a quick ASP.NET Core Web API application\u2014the ubiquitous TODO list\u2014and then \nwe\u2019ll have a quick look at an MVC application before we look at Microsoft\u2019s data-storage framework, \nEntity Framework.\nASP.NET Core Web API\nTo get started with Core Web API, we first need to scaffold out the Web API template; this can be \ndone either via \u201cFile|New\u201d in one of the Visual Studio IDEs, or from the command-line using the .NET \nCore CLI tools by executing \u201cdotnet new webapi -o todoapi.\u201d This will create a subdirectory called \n\u201ctodoapi\u201d and install the .NET Core Web API project inside of it. Out of the box, it scaffolds out a \nsimple API that has one controller to hand back arbitrary \u201cvalue\u201d objects, accessible at \nhttp://localhost:5000/api/values. Before we make any changes to the code, it\u2019s always good to make \nsure the scaffold is working, so execute a \u201cdotnet run\u201d from within the \u201ctodoapi\u201d directory, and \nnavigate to the given URL; the response should be a di", "rt-simple JSON array containing two strings.\nA Web API project, like its cousin the MVC application, is broken into models and controllers, with \nthe \u201cview\u201d assumed to be an automated conversion from a model object into JSON. Thus, in a Web \nAPI project, the goal will be to accept incoming requests, perform the necessary business logic, and \nreturn the appropriate model type, usually corresponding to the resource type in the URL, to be \nconverted to JSON.\nThe Controllers directory contains the code for the ValuesController, which is the default-scaffolded \ncode. It doesn\u2019t use any model objects, which means it\u2019s clearly inferior. Let\u2019s delete it, and replace it \nwith something that\u2019s a little more \u201cMV\u201d-like. That means, first of all, that we need a model object to \nrepresent a TODO item, which is a pretty simple domain object:\npublic class Todo\n{\n public long ID { get; set; }\n public string Description { get; set; }\n public bool Completed { get; set; }\n public Todo()\n {\n Completed = fa", "lse;\n }\n}.NET for Java Developers 31\n(Note that it would be a bit irregular to call this a POJO, since it\u2019s not a Java object, but that\u2019s basically \nexactly what this is. These are sometimes referred to as Plain Old C# Objects, POCOs, or, less often, \nPlain Old DotNet Objects or PODNOs. Definitely doesn\u2019t roll off the tongue like POJOs, but we do \nwhat we can.)\nHaving a domain object, it now remains to build a controller that will respond to the appropriate \nURL (which, by convention, will be prefixed by \u201c/api,\u201d but is of course configurable). The Web API \nexpectation is that a controller will be a class that has a number of public methods that obey some \nconventions, in terms of both method names and parameter sets, like Java has done with later \nversions of the Servlet and EJB specifications.\n [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\n public class TodosController : Controller\n {\n private List<Todo> todos = new List<Todo>() {\n new Todo() { ID=0, Description=\"Get milk\", Completed=true },\n new Todo(", ") { ID=1, Description=\"Get pet food\" },\n new Todo() { ID=2, Description=\"Learn .NET Core\" },\n new Todo() { ID=3, Description=\"Write billion-dollar app\" }\n };\n // GET api/todos\n [HttpGet]\n public IEnumerable<Todo> Get()\n {\n return todos;\n }\n // GET api/todos/5\n [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\n public Todo Get(int id)\n {\n return todos.First((t) => t.ID == id);\n }\n // POST api/todos\n [HttpPost]\n public void Post([FromBody]Todo value)\n {\n todos.Add(value);\n }.NET for Java Developers 32\n // PUT api/todos/5\n [HttpPut(\"{id}\")]\n public void Put(int id, [FromBody]Todo value)\n {\n var todo = todos.First((t) => t.ID == id);\n todo.Description = value.Description;\n todo.Completed = value.Completed;\n }\n // DELETE api/todos/5\n [HttpDelete(\"{id}\")]\n public void Delete(int id)\n {\n }\n }\nTo understand this class, it\u2019s important to understand a few things: First, the square-bracketed \ndeclarations outside each method are what .NET calls \u201ccustom attributes,\u201d which, true story, figured \nprominently in the design for JSR-1", "75 annotations. The attributes provide information (via reflection, \nsame way annotations do) about how HTTP verbs should match against the methods\u2014so, for \nexample, the ASP.NET runtime can know that the two Get() methods should both be invoked when \nan incoming GET request is made.\nThe other half of that binding, of course, is knowing the partial URL pattern that should trigger the \nmethod. Notice that the controller class itself has an attribute, \u201cRouting,\u201d which contains the string \n\u201capi/[controller].\u201d The square-bracketed \u201ccontroller\u201d is to tell the ASP.NET runtime to use the name \nof the class, minus its \u201c-Controller\u201d suffix, so the URL pattern for all of these API endpoints is \u201capi/\ntodos.\u201d From here, standard REST conventions kick in\u2014a GET to \u201capi/todos\u201d should return all of the \nTODO items, so the Get() method taking no parameters and returning an IEnumerable<Todo> (think \nof it as a high-level iterator interface) is the right one to invoke here. If, on the other hand, a caller", " \nwants a single TODO, they\u2019ll issue a request with a URL pattern of \u201capi/todos/\u201d plus the ID of the \nTODO requested. The second Get() method indicates that the URL pattern includes \u201c{id},\u201d so \u201capi/\ntodos/3\u201d will extract \u201c3\u201d and pass it for the value of \u201cid\u201d to the method. Ditto for the Put and Delete \nmethods.\nThe full details of routing are in the ASP.NET documentation, but this should be sufficient to \nunderstand what\u2019s happening here. To see the new controller in action, just do a \u201cdotnet run\u201d from \nthe \u201ctodoapi\u201d directory, and point an HTTP client (curl or Postman) at http://localhost:5000/api/todos\nto see the JSON representations handed back..NET for Java Developers 33\nASP.NET Core MVC\nHTTP-based APIs are nice, but when we need a traditional server-side rendered application, ASP.NET \nprovides a traditional MVC framework called (not surprisingly) ASP.NET Core MVC. It\u2019s the same MVC \nwe find in most modern web frameworks; views are rendered using a particular template syntax, \ncall", "ed \u201cRazor\u201d (or \u201cRazor pages\u201d) that is designed to be expressive yet terse. It\u2019s a syntax inspired \nfrom other similar frameworks, particularly JSP and Ruby-on-Rails, but also tried to be reasonably \nfamiliar to generations of ASP and ASP.NET WebForms developers. Controllers look almost the same \nas they do in the API scenario, and models, of course, are just C# classes representing the domain.\nRazor templates use a .cshtml extension, and like JSP, they use different syntax to indicate which \nparts of the page are to be interpreted in a code-aware manner, as opposed to being taken literally \nas output format. Razor syntax uses the \u201c@\u201d symbol to set off code blocks or other processing \nstatements in several different ways; for example, to do a simple \u201cfor\u201d loop within a page, Razor uses \nan \u201c@for\u201d to set off the loop. Unlike JSP, however, the Razor syntax is clear enough that there isn\u2019t a \nneed to require explicit symbols to set off between code and HTML output:\n<h2>Welcome</h2>\n<ul>\n @", "for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)\n {\n <li>Beetlejuice</li>\n }\n</ul>\nViews, of course, can make use of objects and data provided by a controller, often by making use \nof a predefined key-value map called ViewData. If we want the message and the number of times \nit should be printed to be set up by a controller (perhaps the controller is obtaining it from HTML \nquery parameters or a database), then the controller can set those by using the keys \u201cMessage\u201d and \n\u201cNumTimes\u201d in the ViewData dictionary, respectively. The view can then display them like this:\n<h2>Welcome</h2>\n<ul>\n @for (int i = 0; i < (int)ViewData[\"NumTimes\"]; i++)\n {\n <li>@ViewData[\"Message\"]</li>\n }\n</ul>\nIn essence, ViewData is the ASP.NET equivalent to Servlet \u201crequest\u201d scope..NET for Java Developers 34\nThe controller perspective that drives this looks remarkably similar to what a servlet controller would \ndo, with a few differences:\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\nusing System.Text.Encodings.Web;\nnamespace MvcMovie.Controllers", "\n{\n public class HelloWorldController : Controller\n {\n public IActionResult Welcome(string name, int numTimes = 1)\n {\n ViewData[\"Message\"] = \"Hello \" + name;\n ViewData[\"NumTimes\"] = numTimes;\n return View();\n }\n }\n}\nNotice that the Welcome method takes two parameters, which will be filled in from HTML query \nparameters, fills in the ViewData dictionary, and then calls \u201cView,\u201d which then looks for a Razor page \nfile whose name matches that of the method\u2014in this case, it will be looking for \u201cWelcome.cshtml.\u201d \nASP.NET Core MVC has a number of ways to adjust and change these conventions, but out of the \nbox, the convention-based approach makes it simpler and easier than the configuration descriptor \napproach of older Servlet versions.\nASP.NET Core MVC obviously consists of a great deal more than just what we\u2019ve discussed here, but \nthe underlying message should be clear: ASP.NET Core (both the MVC and the Web API versions) \nlearned a great deal from its contemporaries, including those in t", "he Servlet world (JSP, the Play \nframework, and more), and as such, it will be very straightforward for a Java developer to pick up and \nexplore.\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into the code above, consider having a look into this tutorial: \nhttps://aka.ms/first-web-api..NET for Java Developers 35\nEntity Framework Core\nOf course, being able to access the server and pass JSON back and forth is only half the story; the \nother half is taking that data and storing it. Or rather, storing it, indexing it, searching it, collating \nit, sorting it, drawing pretty graphs with it, and more. When working with a relational database, \nthe technology Microsoft offers its .NET constituents is called Entity Framework, or EF, and in many \nrespects it works like any other object/relational mapping framework does. Thanks to some of the \nlanguage features in C#, however, in many cases working with EF is actually easier than working with \nJPA or Hibernate.\nLike much in the .NET universe, Entity Frame", "work is undergoing a bit of a reshuffle; what used to \nbe a closed, proprietary source base is now open, and as EF was opened to the world, the project \nowners thought a (slight) rebrand seemed appropriate. As a result, the open-source version of EF is \ncalled \u201cEntity Framework Core,\u201d and to begin using it, we need to install it into the project via NuGet, \neither by using the Package Manager in Visual Studio, or by using the command-line for .NET Core by \nentering:\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\nThis is, of course, assuming we are using SQLServer\u2014since not everybody uses SQL Server, however, \na number of different EF database providers are available, including MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, \nFirebase, and a few more. (Third-party vendors are constantly introducing new ones, in a manner \nsimilar to the JDBC driver ecosystem, so bear in mind that Microsoft may not even know all the EF \nproviders in the world.)\nThere\u2019re a few \u201cmanagement\u201d tasks that will be easier t", "o do from the command-line, and EF has a \ncommand-line package that installs \u201cinside\u201d the standard .NET Core command-line tool, but as of this \nwriting, making use of it requires adding a line by hand to the project\u2019s .csproj file:\n<ItemGroup>\n <DotNetCliToolReference \n Include=\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet\"\n Version=\"2.0.0\" />\n</ItemGroup>\nIn addition, the EF Core command-ling tooling requires another dependent package:\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design\nAt this point, EF should be installed and ready to go. More detailed instructions can be found on the \nMicrosoft docs site at https://aka.ms/ef-install.\nFundamentally, the most critical element to using EF from a project is the DbContext. This is a class \nfrom which a project will create a derived class that represents the \u201ccontext\u201d for this project against \nthe database\u2014it will be a repository, session, and gateway, all rolled into one. Like many object/\nrelational tools, it also provides some core ", "behavior, including some migration capabilities (database \nversioning)..NET for Java Developers 36\nLike Hibernate or JPA, EF uses classes to represent entities in the database, and these classes are \noften referred to as \u201cmodel\u201d objects, since they typically serve that purpose in an MVC and/or Web \nAPI application. These will usually look like \u201cplain old C# objects,\u201d with the odd custom attribute to \nhelp give EF some additional hints about how to map to the database table they represent.\nFor example, if the application is a blog, then we will want classes representing a blog, and blog \npost, representing a single blog entry. But there\u2019s also some blog metadata we might want to track \nthat wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to store in the database (such as whether the blog was stored in the \ndatabase), which we will want Entity Framework to ignore entirely. One way to do this is to use a \ncustom attribute, or the EF Fluent API can indicate that the blog metadata class should be ignored \nusing th", "e \u201cOnModelCreating\u201d method, invoked when the database schema is created.\npublic class BloggingContext : DbContext\n{\n public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }\n protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n {\n modelBuilder.Ignore<BlogMetadata>();\n }\n}\npublic class Blog\n{\n public int BlogId { get; set; }\n public string Url { get; set; }\n public List<Post> Posts { get; set; }\n public BlogMetadata Metadata { get; set; }\n}\npublic class Post\n{\n public int PostId { get; set; }\n public string Title { get; set; }\n public string Content { get; set; }\n public Blog Blog { get; set; }\n}\npublic class BlogMetadata\n{\n public DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; }\n}.NET for Java Developers 37\nThe \u201cId\u201d fields, of course, are typically primary key integer columns in the database, and the List \nof Posts is a classic one-to-many relationship. All of this will be eminently familiar to any user of \nHibernate, JPA, or other object-relational modeling system. What will be different will b", "e the way in \nwhich queries and modifiers are run; thanks to LINQ, Entity Framework uses an entirely new style of \nquery starting from the DbSet fields modeled on the DbContext-inheriting class. To do a query to \nfetch all the blogs from the system, we simply create an instance of the context inside of a \u201cusing\u201d \nblock (which is the inspiration for the try-with-resources block in Java7), and use that instance to \nobtain the set of Blog instances and iterate through them:\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext())\n{\n foreach (var blog in context.Blogs) {\n // do something with the blog\n }\n}\nContrary to what we experienced during the heyday of EJB Entity Beans, however, this isn\u2019t a case \nof early loading or late loading; under the hood, Entity Framework is making use of \u201cenumerator \nobjects\u201d (very similar to Java8 streams and the Java Iterable<T> interface) to fetch objects in batches, \njust as a typical database cursor would do.\nIn the Java world, however, filtering that list of blogs ", "to include only those that have \u201cdotnet\u201d in \nthe URL presented problems\u2014either the filtering happens on the database side, in which case the \nquery has to be translated to SQL, or the filtering happens on the client side, which means the entire \ncollection has to be brought over the network. With LINQ, however, this looks like this:\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext())\n{\n foreach (var blog in context.Blogs\n .Where(b => b.Url.Contains(\"dotnet\"))) {\n // do something with the blog\n }\n}\nBut this has the same drawbacks as before; instead, we can use an \u201cexpression tree,\u201d a feature of \nLINQ that compiles into a runtime structure that reflects the compiled code:\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext())\n{\n var allDotnetBlogUrls = from blog in context.Blogs\n where blog.Url.Contains(\"dotnet\")\n select blog.Url;.NET for Java Developers 38\n foreach (var url in allDotnetBlogUrls) {\n // do something with the blog URL\n // note we don't have the entire Blog, just the Url\n }\n}\nThis \u201cfrom-where", "-select\u201d syntax that looks so much like SQL isn\u2019t; it\u2019s a syntax that\u2019s designed to look \nsimilar to SQL and offer many of the same kinds of operators and options. However, this isn\u2019t an SQL \nquery\u2014it will not be sent to the database. Instead, the expression tree is analyzed\u2014and optimized\u2014\nby the EF plumbing to generate an efficient SQL statement, on a driver-by-driver basis. This means \nthat the query filters and restrictions are analyzed on the client side, but sent to the database to be \nexecuted\u2014for example, the above turns into a \u201cSELECT url FROM blog WHERE\u2026\u201d using whatever \nprimitives to do a string-containment check that the database and EF provider offers. This is really \nthe best-of-both-worlds scenario. Couple that with the compile-time type checking that the C# \ncompiler provides against the model objects, and you have a solution that is entirely new to the Java \nworld. (Not impossible to provide, mind you, but still something the Java world currently lacks.)\nUpdates and mod", "ifications entail making modifications on the model object, and those changes \nwill be sent to the database when the context object goes out of the using block\u2019s scope. To add \na new blog, construct the object and add it to the DbSet on the context object; to remove it, use \nthe context\u2019s DbSet again. And should you really, really want to write raw SQL, the context object \nprovides that capacity.\nThere is, of course, much more to discuss about Entity Framework\u2014it\u2019s every bit as rich and powerful \nas JPA, and as such, definitely larger than just what we can cover in a single paper. For more examples \nof LINQ syntax, check out https://aka.ms/101LinqSamples. For 101 LINQ samples, and for more \ninformation on Entity Framework itself, head over to the EF documentation home at https://docs.\nmicrosoft.com/ef/core/..NET for Java Developers 39\nWrapping Up\nTo suggest that this is somehow the end of the story is ludicrous. The .NET ecosystem holds a rich \ntapestry of open-source projects and comm", "ercial tools and frameworks, and that means that a \ndeveloper could, if they wished, spend their entire career just discovering the boundaries there. We \nhaven\u2019t even begun to discuss the alternative languages for the .NET platform, either from Microsoft \n(F#, an object/functional hybrid that fills the same role as Scala, or good old Visual Basic, one of the \noriginal dynamic languages) or from the community (check out Boo, a Python-inspired dynamic \nlanguage). We haven\u2019t begun to explore the different open-source frameworks that do dependency \ninjection. We haven\u2019t begun to explore the different frameworks for doing unit testing, or the online \ntooling from Microsoft to provide agile project support. We haven\u2019t even mentioned Azure.\nThis is a brave new land, intrepid adventurer, but rest easy: Much of what you know from your time \nin the world of Java will serve you well here. The concepts are similar, but different enough to be \ninteresting. The platforms are powerful, and the commun", "ities open and inviting. The tools are easily \nobtained, and the tutorials plenty. You might even recognize a few familiar names, those who have \ncome before you across the pond and gone on this adventure before you. Be the tourist, if you like, \nbut know that there\u2019s plenty of room to build your own home and settle down here, even if it\u2019s only a \nsummer home. Come in, and be welcome.\nAnd, unlike a certain young boy on his first trip to France, you won\u2019t have to worry about somebody\u2019s \nfather trying to convince you that \u201cescargot\u201d is French for \u201ctater tots.\u201d"]
