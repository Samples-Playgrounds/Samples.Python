<p>Introduction</p>
<p>When I was about eight years old, my parents took my sister and me to Paris, France. It was our first
trip out of the country, and aside from the ridiculously long flight—eight hours on an airplane feels
like forever to somebody who hasn’t yet finished their first decade of life—I really had no idea of
what to expect. In fact, in an amusing anecdote my father has yet to tire of telling, I remember having
to sit down with my parents in front of a globe so that they could explain to me that “the United
States” was not, in fact, synonymous with “the world.”</p>
<p>It was entirely a trip of firsts: my first experience wandering around in a world where I couldn’t
understand any of the written signs, my first experience eating food I couldn’t recognize, and my
first experience feeling completely lost in the world around me. I found, to my eight-year-old horror,
that I couldn’t even figure out which bathroom to use—which, considering I had just the year before
managed to convince my mother I didn’t need to be escorted to the bathroom and back, was of
particular concern. I didn’t want her to start thinking I actually needed adult supervision. This was
clearly not my home, and I was more than a little terrified of it.</p>
<p>Visiting a foreign land, particularly to someone who has cocooned themselves entirely in the
concepts and cultures of “home,” can be intimidating and overwhelming without a guide. On that trip
to France I had my parents, and despite neither of them speaking anything close to fluent French,
they managed to guide us through the tricky parts. (French-English guidebooks are a wonderful
thing.)</p>
<p>For the typical Java developer, finding a guide to exploring the .NET ecosystem can be tricky, since
the average Java developer can still hearken back to a time when expressing an interest in looking at
.NET was tantamount to declaring a desire to betray everything good and right in the world (or so it
seemed, at least at the time).</p>
<p>In this paper, I will serve as your guide to the .NET world. I’ve been a part of the .NET ecosystem
almost as long as I’ve been a part of Java’s. I started with Java in 1996; I started with what would
become .NET in 2000, even before it was announced. I’ve built applications in both, written books
for both, and explored the source for both. They’re closer to one another than you might think, but
each has been fundamentally influenced by the people using them. In fact, it’s not a bad analogy to
think of them as twin brothers, separated at birth, raised by different sets of parents. Same DNA, but
shaped by their experiences and events to be different in a number of interesting places.</p>
<p>If you’re a Java developer, looking to get started exploring the .NET ecosystem, then suspend what
you think you know, take my hand, and let’s take a trip to a foreign land. Doing so will require a little
history to understand how things came to be, then a quick set of instructions on how to get the
tooling set up (and which tooling you want, depending on your preferences). Once the environment
is set up, we can pick up the critical differences between C# and Java, and start diving into some
of the central frameworks in this world—ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and a few others. When we</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>finish up, if you’re following along, you’ll have everything you need to start your own exploration of
the .NET community, and from there you’ll get to draw your own conclusions and make your own
opinions.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you’ll know how to order off the menu and tell the bathrooms apart.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>If you’d like to skip the walk down memory lane, you can jump to the next section, Getting Started.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the history of .NET begins in October of 2000, at Microsoft’s Professional Developer
Conference (PDC), when Microsoft announced to the world that they were working on a new
programming platform, on which would rest the fate of all Microsoft development to follow. It was
called .NET, it would be the backbone for their upcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would
be a part of their data management system (nicknamed “SQLServer.NET”), and it would form the
core development platform for building interconnected applications into the future by leveraging
emerging standards such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few others the world had not yet really come to
understand. It would be the principal competitor platform to their principal development rival at the
time, Sun Microsystems, and its Java platform. And the world could see that the shot was fired, the
line in the sand drawn, and the armies drawn up; clearly, this was Microsoft copying the efforts of its
competitors, seeking dominance, and….</p>
<p>And most of the world completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it had come to
exist, and what Microsoft really sought to obtain from it.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s fair to suggest that many within the Microsoft ecosystem misunderstood what .NET was
really about; once announced, the marketing machine took over. Much effort was wasted due to the
entanglement of “.NET” with “web services,” and it would take the better part of a decade before
people could understand that the two really had nothing intrinsically to do with one another any
more than “Perl” did with “databases.” Microsoft management compounded all this confusion by
re-branding the “.NET” suffix to a number of their products, which they later corrected but well after
the damage had been done.</p>
<p>But despite all that, solid engineering rests at the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made
it harder to see, but it’s always been there. To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its
proper historical context: that, in truth, it was the simple “next step” along an evolutionary chain that
stretched back much further than that October keynote almost two decades ago.</p>
<p>Of components, managed environments, and code
In the beginning, there was C.</p>
<p>To be more accurate about it, in the beginning a number of programming languages were created
to make it easier to produce programs that knew how to execute on a single chip. They integrated
directly with the hardware, making use of the facilities there to obtain memory, interact with the
disk, and present data to the display for the user to understand. In time, we as an industry found that
this direct-hardware interaction had its drawbacks, and we sought to create a series of abstractions
on top of that hardware, to help coordinate the use of the hardware across multiple simultaneously</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>executing programs. We called that first attempt at regulating and managing the hardware an
operating system. And it was pretty good. So good, in fact, that numerous flavors of operating
system were born, including Microsoft’s Windows operating system, and Solaris, and macOS (though
it was called “System 7” back then), and Linux, and a few others whose names exist now only in the
history books and dusty corners of Usenet forums. (Bonus points if you recognize these names:
Minix, Mach, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even more bonus points if you ever ran one of them. If you
ever ran DOS, though, it just means you’re old.)</p>
<p>The bigger, more important issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system
itself—that programmers found it helpful and useful to have “something else” working with their
programs. That “something else” would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs
executed and behaved, rather than assuming that every single nuance had to be the programmers’
responsibility.</p>
<p>This concept, in large, is essentially that of a “managed environment.” Although it has its roots
in operating systems, it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of
containers and cloud: that there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are
responsible for details that the programmer doesn’t want to have to deal with. Operating systems
are managed environments in that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to
schedule the execution of threads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network
ports or data files. Virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in
that they regulate the access and reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode
format into CPU-native instructions, and prevent the direct access of memory (except under very
specific circumstances) in order to avoid process termination by careless programming. Containers
such as Docker are managed environments in that they provide a context around an executable
to mimic a precise environment—configuration files, environment variables, and shared network
settings—so that developers can be assured that the environment outside their programs are
consistent regardless of where they are deployed.</p>
<p>By the early ’90s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for
Windows developers to be able to take “the next step forward” in development evolution. The “GUI
revolution” of the mid-’80s was largely finished; programs weren’t just about “dialogs and data,”
but now needed to integrate more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for
example) and start taking advantage of networking in greater detail. (Old developers like me will
remember that it was around 1995 that references to HTTP and “the World Wide Web” were just
starting to appear in publications and technology journals.)</p>
<p>As is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges emerged. C++ developers
had been speaking of “reusable code” for several years, but it was Visual Basic (and Delphi, along with
several other “4GL” variants) that demonstrated actual practical code reuse, in the form of “controls”:
widgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly without requiring in-depth
knowledge about the controls’ implementation. Simply obtain the library, put it into the right place
within the development environment, drag-and-drop the control into the construction area, and lo,
the developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of “application frameworks,”
like MFC and OWL, but “GUI builders” had demonstrated that the concept of “controls” could be
leveraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and events; now</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Microsoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the bigger world beyond GUI development.
More importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship—make it possible for outside
developers to build “things” that could be used by existing things (such as the operating system or,
perhaps, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their implementation.</p>
<p>To do that, they needed to create a managed environment that would work across a variety of
different languages, but all operating under the same rules. That effort, called the Component
Object Model (COM), was the first of several “managed platforms” that emerged during the early-
and mid-’90s. (Ironically, several open-source efforts would go after this same space many years
after Microsoft declared COM “finished,” including Mozilla’s XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in
that it became the backbone of Windows development for a significant percentage of the Windows
platform. But it still failed in that it left programs vulnerable to many of the same things that had
plagued them before: memory leaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpected process termination at
the first mistake. It was clear that, despite the managed platform, writing code in a “native” language
(such as C/C++ or Delphi) still wasn’t a particularly great place to be.</p>
<p>It was around this same timeframe, 1995, that Sun Microsystems demonstrated the HotJava browser
to the world, the centerpiece of which was this language that could be used to write executable
bits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft had come to the realization that this was what it
was missing: a “managed language” to run on top of their managed platform. A managed language
had exactly the right “distance” from the underlying operating system they were seeking—garbage
collection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashes, and the virtual machine could
help enforce stronger security controls that the world had just started to realize they needed. It was,
in many ways, a perfect match. Microsoft invested resources into building their own JVM, extended
their IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrated COM into the runtime.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own destruction.</p>
<p>Hello, .NET
Divorces are never a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one is always fraught with opinion,
revisionist history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997/1998, two facts were becoming clear:
one, Sun didn’t care for Microsoft’s work increasing interoperability between their JVM and native
COM components in Windows1, and two, Microsoft and Java were going to part ways, one way or
another. (Who got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)</p>
<p>Either certain groups within Microsoft could see the writing on the wall or they had come to find
issues (real or perceived) with the Java Virtual Machine; either way, by 1998, a new effort came to
life inside of Microsoft, designed to bring a new managed platform and managed language into the
world. Originally intended as the successor to COM, it went through a variety of names, including</p>
<p>1 For the curious, Microsoft offered additional platform-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with native
COM components. The irony of this is deep, considering that Sun had actually allowed for COM-specific
native interfaces in their JNI specification—the first three methods in the interface table for a JNIEnv (“JNI
environment”) object were specifically left “reserved” for the necessary three methods (AddRef, Release, and
QueryInterface) of every COM interface object. Those three slots are still reserved to this day.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>“COM+,” the “Component Object Runtime” (COR), the “Universal RunTime” (URT), and “Next-
Generation Windows Services” (NGWS) before finally being introduced to the world as “.NET” at that
October 2000 PDC. Along with it would come a new language, code-named “COOL” (supposedly
to stand for the “Component-Oriented Object Language,” although opinions vary now) and later
renamed “C#.”</p>
<p>While most observers considered C# and the CLR (the Common Language Runtime, the virtual
machine executing the bytecode) to be direct competitors of Java, Microsoft took careful steps to
ensure that it was “open” in ways that Java was not: where the JVM was designed from the beginning
to be a virtual machine for a single language, the CLR embraced a more polyglot approach, with
Microsoft even going so far as to recruit several universities and companies to create new languages
for this platform and/or adapt existing ones. This project, nicknamed “Project 7” (for the 7 groups
that participated), debuted several of these languages during .NET’s introduction, and included CLR
flavors of Eiffel, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of these languages gained any traction after the first
few years of existence, and most no longer exist, but their presence had the effect on Microsoft of
“keeping them honest” with respect to other languages beyond C# and Visual Basic as the platform
grew and evolved. (Microsoft itself would later go on to introduce a number of new CLR-based
languages, including a compiled-to-binary version of ECMAScript, two different efforts at bringing
managed coding to C++, a hybrid object/functional language called F#, and several more research
languages.)</p>
<p>However, Microsoft also sought to make sure that .NET was not a proprietary effort by investing
thousands of man-hours into the creation of a series of international specifications—through the
European Computer Manufacturer’s Association (ECMA2)—to ensure that C# and the underlying
platform were both open industry standards. C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and the
underlying runtime was given the name the “Common Language Infrastructure” (CLI), and accepted
and ratified as ECMA-335. Intel, HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in
keeping these specifications up to date with changes to the language and the platform, the most
recent updates3 coming in 2012 for the CLI and 2017 for C#.</p>
<p>With the introduction of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpected side-effect: members of
the open-source community began to examine building a “clean-room” implementation of them.
While the CLI Specification didn’t include any of the Windows-specific features (such as a deep COM
integration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution for their existing
developer base, the CLI Specification itself provided enough integration points to make it interesting
to implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one such project, calling
it Mono.</p>
<p>The specification also gave Microsoft some room to do what some within the company had been
looking to do for quite a while: provide a research and experimentation vehicle for the academic and
research communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripped-down version of the CLR
source code, code-named “Rotor,” distributed under an open-source license they created, called the</p>
<p>2 ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification for the language commonly known as “JavaScript,” but is
more rightly called “ECMAScript,” governed as ECMA-262.
3 CLI: https://www.iso.org/standard/58046.html and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/
Ecma-335.htm; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>“Shared Source” license, giving it the formal name “Shared Source CLI” or “SSCLI.” While Mono would
remain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, and Rotor of even less interest to
those outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source mindset were sown. Over time, Mono
would be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own company, Xamarin, which would faithfully
parallel the work described by the specifications and periodically try out new ideas for the open-
source community to consider.</p>
<p>Microsoft officially released the first version of C# and the CLR in 2002, and new versions came
roughly three years apart after that: C# 2.0 in 2005, and C# 3.0 in 2008. Each was contained in a
product release of Visual Studio, such that C# 2.0 and version 2.0 of the CLR runtime was released
with Visual Studio 2005, and C# 3.0 and CLR 3.5 came with Visual Studio 2008. Microsoft then shifted
to a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, and most
recently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the versions of C# and the CLR started falling out of lockstep
with Visual Studio, deliberately, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>The first was that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, and was starting to
unbundle its various parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independent, parts. F#, which
first shipped “out of the box” in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to start down the open-
source path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project, it had never really
embraced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place. Microsoft started
working shortly thereafter on an open-source rewrite of its entire compiler toolchain, code-named
“Roslyn.” By the time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem were starting to ship
independently, with Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for developers to gather the parts
of the ecosystem they desired more easily. Open-source package management (called NuGet), which
began life well outside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated into Visual Studio so that
NuGet came “out of the box,” much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java IDEs.</p>
<p>Mono, meanwhile, had started to gain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular, the
gaming toolkit Unity had expressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running
inside the Unity toolkit. Unity-based games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the
JavaScript-on-.NET implementation that Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a Python-
inspired .NET language called Boo. Additionally, the open-source community produced another .NET
implementation, the .NET Micro Framework, specifically aimed at embedded software systems and
small-scale hardware such as the Arduino platform.</p>
<p>All of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, Microsoft announced that the source
for ASP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to anyone who wanted to look at it. It
wasn’t full open-source yet, though, in that they weren’t accepting pull requests. It was, however,
an important step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It announced that it would completely
open-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making it available to any platform and accept
pull requests from any developer so inclined. A new .NET implementation would be completely
open-source and hosted on GitHub, called .NET Core. It also announced the creation of the .NET
Foundation, an industry consortium of groups dedicated to the growth of the .NET platform, in</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>much the same fashion that the Java Community Process governs the continued growth of the Java
platform4.</p>
<p>To be sure, Microsoft made some missteps along the way, and definitely learned a few hard lessons
about its relationship with the open-source community, but by late 2017, Microsoft was statistically
the biggest contributor on GitHub (measured in terms of total numbers of contributors5), and all
of its key components—language, runtime, libraries, and many of its tools—were available for
download on GitHub.</p>
<p>Microsoft also started to get more serious about the cross-platform/portability aspects of the .NET
ecosystem. Xamarin, which by 2009 had started producing tools that could cross-compile .NET
bytecode into native applications for iOS and Android platforms (the catchy-named “MonoDroid”
and less-catchy “Mono for iOS” toolkits), was flourishing, and Microsoft realized that a practical story
for being able to share non-UI portions of code across multiple platforms was necessary if they
wanted to avoid developer confusion.</p>
<p>While the ECMA Specifications had discussed different “profiles” for levels of .NET standardization,
these profiles were in many ways similar to their “Java Standard Edition,” “Java Micro Edition,” and
“Java Enterprise Edition” cousins—a little unwieldy in a number of ways, but most notably in that
there wasn’t really a good way to guarantee compatibility across platforms and implementation
versions—if code is compiled by the Java6 compiler, it is safe to assume that it will continue to run on
the Java6 virtual machine from whence it was compiled, but the Java APIs do change from release to
release, and this has tripped up the unwary Java developer from time to time.</p>
<p>Thus, in 2016, Microsoft announced the “.NET Standard 1.0” profile, a collection not of relatively
vague implementation documents, but an actual API standard, such that a developer who sought
to build a library that could be used by a variety of different platforms (across a certain number of
versions of that platform, even) could know that anything that implemented .NET Standard 1.0 would
be able to consume that library, regardless of where that code is running—on a web server, on a
mobile device, or even on somebody’s VR helmet (running a 3D interactive application written with
Unity).</p>
<p>Which brings us, now, to the current day.</p>
<p>4 Ironically, Microsoft’s move to the .NET Foundation comes at the same time Oracle is looking to move
away from the JCP; both companies have experience with standards organizations, and neither wants to see
innovation stifled in committee.

<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Hello, strange new world
To the Java developer, this is a strange, strange world compared to the one they glimpsed into back
in 2000.</p>
<p>For starters, the Java world looks wildly different than it once did. Sun no longer exists, acquired
by Oracle. Oracle and Google squabble in the courtroom over the legal implications of Java on
Android devices. Spring was acquired, then spun out into its own company, Pivotal. JBoss absorbed
into Red Hat. IBM no longer really even tries to push Java much anymore. Does anybody even
remember EJB? Or that it was once “a thing”? Who would’ve guessed any of this back in 2001?</p>
<p>But meanwhile, over in the Microsoft world, a new CEO runs the firm, and he has made it clear that
Microsoft is an open-source player. A new player, to be sure, and still finding its feet in a variety of
ways, but one committed to the open-source community. In addition to the strides it has made with
.NET, Microsoft has opened Azure up to almost every mainstream language and platform—including
Java. (Yes, you can run Tomcat and MySQL in an Azure cloud cluster.) SQL Server has been ported
to Linux. Windows Server can be loaded into a Docker container, and Microsoft works with the
Docker community to bring Docker-on-Windows up to the same level of sublime that it has on other
platforms.</p>
<p>Within the .NET ecosystem, the .NET Standard, now at a 2.0 release, provides an umbrella of
guaranteed compatibility across three major platforms of this writing: the Windows-based .NET
Framework (which contains the necessary libraries for building Windows client applications, for
example), .NET Core (intended for the cross-platform server world, including Docker containers
and cloud-native targets), and Xamarin (principally aimed at the iOS and Android world, but also
providing bindings for building macOS applications). Unity has joined the .NET Foundation and
expects to be aligned with the various versions of .NET Standard by mid-2018.</p>
<p>All of which means that it’s not a bad time to start exploring this world in more depth.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Getting Started: Tooling</p>
<p>Getting started with .NET depends pretty heavily on your choice of operating system and, to a lesser
degree, the development experience you want. As mentioned earlier, Visual Studio supports both
Windows and macOS, as well as a variety of Linux distributions, which pretty much covers everybody.
In this section, the goal is to get tools installed, a basic introduction to the major project artifacts,
and, of course, build the traditional “HelloWorld.” Once we’ve done that, we’ll talk a little bit about
what we’re producing, and the package system for .NET (called NuGet).</p>
<p>Hello, web?
If you’re just looking to flirt a little with the C# language but don’t want to commit any disk space
to the idea, one of the easiest ways to explore the language is the online interactive browser-based
tutorial found at https://aka.ms/csharpquickstarts.</p>
<p>However, doing so will run into a whole slew of limitations to your exploration, so sooner or later
you’re probably going to want to commit some disk space.</p>
<p>Docker all the things!
If you’re a Docker enthusiast, and you want to get the quickest path possible to working with .NET,
fire up a Microsoft-maintained .NET Core Docker container by running:</p>
<p>docker run -it microsoft/dotnet bash</p>
<p>This will pull the latest version of Microsoft’s Docker Hub–stored Docker images, and drop you into
a shell prompt from which you can run the “dotnet” CLI tool. When you are ready to edit some files,
run the Docker image with a volume mount to a host’s local directory, and use your favorite editor—
might we suggest Visual Studio Code?—to edit the .NET Core–generated files we’re about to create.</p>
<p>Linux .NET?
As with most things Linux, installation instructions depend on which flavor of Linux you’re running.</p>
<p>Red Hat is the easiest install, since Microsoft and Red Hat have partnered on a few things in the past,
so the .NET Core packages are in the Red Hat distribution channels; assuming you are using the
Red Hat Subscription Manager, two commands get .NET Core on your machine:</p>
<p>yum install rh-dotnet20 -y
scl enable rh-dotnet20 bash</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>At that point, the “dotnet” tool should be in your PATH and good to go.</p>
<p>If you’re on Ubuntu, there’s a bit more work required. While Microsoft is working to get the .NET
Core packages into the standard Ubuntu distribution channels, at the time of this writing that hasn’t
happened completely, so Ubuntu users will need to add Microsoft’s key and Ubuntu-release-specific
URL into the list of sources the Ubuntu apt-get utilities check for packages. Full details are on the
.NET Core website at www.dot.net/core; once that’s done, however, apt-get can install the “dotnet-
sdk-2.1.101” package onto the system, and this will get the “dotnet” tool in the PATH and good to go.</p>
<p>This “register the channel” followed by “use the standard package manager” is actually the same
story for Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, and Debian; again, full step-by-step instructions are on the
.NET Core “Getting Started” page (https://aka.ms/dotnet-getstarted-linux), which has a drop-down
to choose between the six flavors of Linux that .NET Core supports. Add the Microsoft feed to the
package manager, use the package manager to do the install, and the “dotnet” tool should be
available on the PATH.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, .NET Core is ready to go.</p>
<p>Visual Studio Code
For almost any operating system you might find yourself using, including most of the popular
distributions of Linux, Microsoft has a lightweight editor called Visual Studio Code. If you’ve been
doing a lot of web front-end work, you may already have been using it. In many ways, it’s the latest
attempt at building an “editor-plus-plug-ins” tool, and it is gaining some traction with the world
outside the Microsoft ecosystem. (It’s actually the preferred tool for working with Google’s open-
source Angular project, among other things.) It’s also available from http://code.visualstudio.com,
it’s available for Windows, macOS, and most of the major flavors of Linux, and it’s a pretty quick
download and install. And, honestly, it’s not a bad editor for writing Java code, in case you were
wondering; check out the Java extensions at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/extensions the
next time you’re looking for a lightweight editor that understands Java projects.</p>
<p>Firing up Visual Studio Code from the command-line is often just a simple “code” if you’re in the root
directory of your project.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Mac .NET?
If you’re like a lot of Java developers (myself included), you own a macOS machine. It might surprise
you to know that many of the developers at Microsoft do, too. (Some of them repaved it with
Windows, but a lot of them run native macOS.) Doing .NET on macOS falls into one of two options.</p>
<p>One is the command-line approach, which you can obtain via Homebrew. For the moment, using
Homebrew requires tapping a cask, but after that, it’s as simple as doing the classic “brew install”
thing:</p>
<p>$ brew tap caskroom/cask #if you haven't already
$ brew cask install dotnet-sdk</p>
<p>This will run a custom installer script that will put .NET Core onto your machine, so it’s not completely
Homebrew-friendly, but it “does the job.” Once finished, fire up a new Terminal window (to pick up
the environment changes that the installer makes) and run:</p>
<p>$ dotnet --version
2.1.1</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Which should respond with “2.<something>,” depending on which version is published as of the time
you read this.</p>
<p>If you’re a bit more of an IDE fan, however, you’re still in luck. With its acquisition of Xamarin,
Microsoft also acquired Xamarin’s IDE for the Mac, which was just recently re-branded to be called
“Visual Studio for Mac.” Based on the open-source “MonoDevelop” project, it’s not quite as extensive
an IDE experience as Visual Studio, owing to a smaller set of plug-ins developed for it, but that can
actually make it more enjoyable to use sometimes, particularly if all you’re looking for is a good
editor, project management system, and debugger.</p>
<p>Installing Visual Studio for Mac is a pretty straightforward experience—http://visualstudio.com has
a link for an installer that, when opened, will go through the usual Mac installation process. There
are a number of options here that aren’t absolutely necessary for our purposes, but since a complete
install is measured only in single-digit gigabytes of disk space, unless you’re constrained for space,
why not just keep it simple and install it all?</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Once started, take a few minutes to grab some coffee; like its cousin on Windows, Visual Studio
for Mac will download the components it needs and install them to disk. Don’t walk away from the
machine for too long, however—the installer will ask for the administrator password several times
during the installation.</p>
<p>Windows: Visual Studio
Lastly, if you’re running Windows, the most obvious option is installing Visual Studio—that
combination has been the default for Windows-based development for close to two decades, and
most Java developers know enough already to realize that. What many don’t realize is that there is a
free-to-download “Community Edition” that has all the core parts of the IDE and toolchain: compiler,
debugger, editor, project management, and so on. You can find the Visual Studio Community
Edition via your favorite search engine or wander on over to http://visualstudio.com to grab an
installer. Make sure you’re on a good Internet connection, since 98% of the install is coming from the
Microsoft servers.</p>
<p>When the Visual Studio installer fires up, it immediately becomes obvious that this is every bit as
large of an installation as Eclipse or IDEA—hundreds of options lie before you. While most of them
are not necessary (many of them have to do with building unmanaged C++ code, for example, or
for building game projects), selecting all of them will help ensure that anything you might look to
explore will be available to you. The total install size is about the same as your favorite Java IDE
with all the trimmings, when all is said and done. Alternatively, you can select just “.NET Core Cross-
platform development” for a streamlined install of just .NET Core.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>If all of this seems a little hard to remember, honestly, you’re not wrong. Remember, Microsoft is
fairly new to this “make it work on all platforms” story, and they’re constantly trying to improve the
whole experience, which in the past has resulted in some churn and confusion. One of the things
they’ve done in 2017 is to try to collect all their .NET-related resources together into a single URL for
easy reference. That URL, www.dot.net, is the place to start, and will end up redirecting to the main
Microsoft site dedicated to the .NET ecosystem. It’s an overview of all the different things one can do
with .NET, as well as the different platform installers. Probably the most useful things are the button-
links to “Get Started” and “Download”; the latter takes you to a collection of different download
links, and the former takes you to a series of tutorial steps to getting started building a console
“HelloWorld” application. (Sounds familiar, no?)</p>
<p>Hello, dotnet: CLI style
Regardless of how you’ve got the command-line tooling on your machine, it all boils down to one
thing: The machine has a command-line tool called “dotnet” that’s in the PATH and hooked up to an
Internet connection. Away we go.</p>
<p>The “dotnet” tool, in many ways, is a re-examination of the thought process that Maven brought into
the world: a command-line tool that can generate out a project based on customizable/extensible
templates stored in the cloud, as well as act as a single point-of-control for building, running,
testing, and any other commands that need to happen to a given project. The “dotnet” tool hides a
fair amount of .NET Core’s machinery, in the same way that Maven hides a fair amount of the Java
machinery (CLASSPATH references, for example), so keep in mind that we’re only looking at the tip of
the iceberg as we work with this. (Make no mistake—the tooling here goes just as deep and just as
wide as anything we’ve ever used in the Java world, and it’s just as easy to get lost in it if we dive too
deeply into it too quickly.)</p>
<p>To start a .NET Core application, we can use “dotnet” to generate a project based on the “console”
application template, like so:</p>
<p>$ dotnet new console -o HelloWorld</p>
<p>This will generate a “console” project into the directory “HelloWorld”; for those who are curious,
“dotnet new” by itself, or “dotnet new --list,” will list all of the project templates that the “dotnet”
command knows about. Out of the box, it has about a dozen or so project templates, including
console applications, class libraries, a half-dozen flavors of web projects, and so on. This list is
expected to grow and evolve as time goes on, just as the list of Maven archetypes grew after its
release. Note that the list also allows generation of projects across different languages, so those who
really want to sneak a peek at what an F# Web API project would look like can run:</p>
<p>$ dotnet new webapi -o HelloFSAPI -lang F#</p>
<p>ASP.NET Web API will be discussed in a little more detail later in this paper; however interesting,
though, F# is not something we’re going to explore here. You can learn more at fsharp.org.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Implicit in the “new” command is a request to download all of the dependencies that a project
requires, which in “dotnet” parlance is a command to “restore.” This requests all of the dependent
assemblies—JAR file equivalents, essentially—from a Maven-like, cloud-based service called
NuGet. NuGet was heavily inspired by Maven and Ruby gems, which means, for the most part, it
works the same way Maven does—when doing a “dotnet restore,” the machine must be connected
to the Internet, and depending on the size of the project, could take a while to download all the
dependencies.</p>
<p>Once the project has been “restore”d, all of the dependencies are downloaded, and the application
can be run by using “dotnet run” from within the project directory. This will, not surprisingly, print
“Hello World!” to the terminal. If outside of the project directory, tell “dotnet” which project to run
by passing a reference to the project file (HelloWorld.csproj6) in via the “--project” command-line
argument:</p>
<p>$ dotnet run --project HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj
Hello World!</p>
<p>If you’re inside the project directory, this becomes a simple “dotnet run”; .NET assemblies know their
entry point intrinsically.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling curious, poke into the “bin/Debug” directory underneath HelloWorld; in it resides the
generated compiler artifacts, including the .NET assembly, “HelloWorld.dll,” and its debugger support
file, “HelloWorld.pdb.” It may seem strange that one would “execute” a DLL, but an assembly, like a
JAR file, is a repository of bytecode (but with much tighter cohesion than a JAR file provides), and the
extension is (for the most part) almost entirely irrelevant. The dotnet launcher serves much the same
purpose as the Java launcher does: to find the assembly specified on the command-line, load it, then
execute the entry point method and get out of the way.</p>
<p>Hello, .NET: IDE style
If Visual Studio (or Visual Studio for Mac) has finished installing, fire it up, and either select “File | New
Project,” or use the Start Page displayed in the center of the IDE to begin a new project by clicking
one of the “New Project” templates. Depending on which Visual Studio you’re running, you may be
presented with two kinds of console applications: one that represents a native Console Application
(for Windows, it will reference .NET Framework) and one that targets .NET Core (that’s the open-
source implementation). Choose either one (I prefer .NET Core), then do the usual IDE thing of
choosing which directory in which the project should live, and its name. Note that we can designate
this as a Git repository as well. Once finished, Visual Studio will think for a bit, then show the finished
template, complete with C# code, ready for editing, building, and debugging.</p>
<p>6 The .NET Core tooling took a bit of a detour recently through the world of JSON by working off of a “project.
json” file, which is still mentioned in a number of .NET Core tutorials; that has been deprecated in favor of the
MSBuild-based files, and is no longer supported. JSON is still used for a number of configuration files, but the
.NET community reacted pretty strongly to the use of JSON for the project files, and Microsoft, looking to be a
good open-source steward, responded to that feedback by backtracking and moving back to MSBuild.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Building the code (Ctrl-Shift-B on Windows, Command-B on macOS) produces a console application
(a native Windows .exe for Windows or a .NET Core project for macOS), which can either be built by
navigating to the “Debug/bin” subdirectory of the project and running it directly or by launching it
from within Visual Studio.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>The debugger works the same as it does within any IDE, and Visual Studio has its share of rich
debugger tricks (which are really beyond the scope of this article, but easy to find https://aka.ms/
vsdebugger). HelloWorld, achievement unlocked.</p>
<p>Solutions and projects
Within the Visual Studio ecosystem, code is arranged into “projects,” which are in turn collected
into “solutions.” A project is language-specific, and sports an XML file whose extension reflects that
language—C# projects are stored in “.csproj” files, for example. Each project produces one artifact—
an assembly, which we’ll discuss in more detail later. Solutions, then, are made up of any number
of projects listed in a solution file (.sln), making it quite common for a solution to have some top-
level “executable” (whether that is a website project, Web API project, or some form of GUI project)
with one or more “library” projects to support it. It’s extremely common, in fact, to see projects in
separate subdirectories under the directory in which the solution file lives. This arrangement won’t
seem strange to the working Java developer; in many respects, this is no different from what we
would see in a Java codebase, where some collection of code (project) produces a JAR file, and a
Maven or Gradle build (solution) brings it all together into a bundle of some form.</p>
<p>Microsoft is working to keep all these file types in sync across all versions of Visual Studio, so that
a project that builds on Visual Studio for Mac should also build on Windows, using an underlying
build system called “MSBuild.” Heavily Ant-inspired, MSBuild has been the build system for .NET since</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Visual Studio 2005, and Xamarin was quick to adopt it for their project file system when they started
building out their toolchain.</p>
<p>Goodbye, HelloWorld
Tooling is now installed. The Gods of Computer Science have been appeased by the creation of a
successful HelloWorld application. It’s time to take a pass across the C# language.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>C#, Succinctly</p>
<p>While we can’t cover the entirety of the C# language in half a dozen pages, we can cover the key
concepts of C# pretty quickly. In fact, we can do it in one sentence: C# is an object-oriented language
that borrows heavily from its lexical ancestors, C++ and Java, and from other “component”-oriented
languages such as Delphi. In recent years, C# (like most languages) has begun to incorporate
more functional programming concepts into its syntax, and as a result presents a pretty multi-
paradigmatic set of capabilities.</p>
<p>In other words, take Java, throw in a number of the features Java developers have debated for a
decade or more, then add a bunch of functional programming concepts, stir well, bake for 15 years,
and serve. Microsoft’s language designers have been much more aggressive than Sun’s when it
comes to introducing new features into their respective languages, so for the most part a Java
developer’s experience with C# will probably be characterized by “Oh, sure, that all looks pretty
similar—wait, what is THAT?”</p>
<p>By the way, C# currently sits at version 7.2 at the time of this writing, and Microsoft’s language
designers have been just as aggressive in the latest revisions of the language as they were in the
early ones. This is a language under constant evolution, for good or for ill. So there’s much to discuss,
and we will not be able to cover the entire surface area of the language—the focus here will be only
on those parts that will be unintuitive to the Java developer looking at “average” C# code.</p>
<p>C# Basics
To begin, let’s take a look at what was generated as part of those “HelloWorld” console applications,
since that’s probably the easiest way to get started.</p>
<p>using System;</p>
<p>namespace HelloDotNet
{
class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args)
{
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
}
}
}</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to spot a number of things right off the bat: C# is a C-family language, using curly-
brackets to denote scope blocks and semicolons to terminate statements. Code is organized into</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>namespaces using the “namespace” keyword, and pretty clearly we have classes just as Java does.
The Console class (part of the “System” namespace) represents the command-line input/output
facilities, and WriteLine is obviously a synonym for “println.” Square brackets are used to denote an
array in the same way they do in Java, and arrays in C# work almost exactly the same way as they do
in Java, save that they have been slightly more “formalized” in that there is a full-blown class, System.
Array, that defines a number of methods and properties that all arrays will share. Core “primitive”
types are actually defined as full-blown classes, so that System.Array is the “class” representing each
array instance, System.String is the “string” primitive type, System.Int32 is the “int” primitive type,
and so on. All types, whether “primitive” (what .NET calls “value types”) or “class,” all inherit from
the base System.Object type, with value types being “boxed” to objects when necessary. (This was
the inspiration for autoboxing rules in Java5, in fact.) As a result, “System.String s” and “string s” are
actually entirely equivalent declarations. New value types can be defined, but it’s pretty rare.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some of the more straightforward parts of the language.</p>
<p>Starting exploration: classes, properties,
and methods
C# 1.0 was, in large measure, a near-direct clone of Java, with some keyword changes and some new
features that Java has debated for years: explicit properties and delegates (an early form of lambda
expressions). Thus, we can write the traditional “Person” type in C# like so:</p>
<p>class Person
{
public string FirstName
{
get { return this.firstName; }
set { this.firstName = value; }
}
private string firstName;</p>
<pre><code>public string LastName
{
    get { return this.lastName; }
    set { this.lastName = value; }
}
private string lastName;

public int Age
{
    get { return this.age; }
    set { this.age = value; }
</code></pre>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>}
private int age;
public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)
{
this.FirstName = fn;
this.LastName = ln;
this.Age = a;
}
}</p>
<p>Properties can be read-only by eliminating the “set” clause, and write-only (if that makes sense,
which it rarely does) by eliminating the “get” clause. The implicit parameter to a “set” clause is always
called “value,” and there are no restrictions to what a property-get or property-set clause can do
within its body, although 95% of the time they simply read and write a field within the class.</p>
<p>So far, if anything, it seems more verbose than Java. However, that was the C# language as of 15
years ago—they’ve made a few changes along the way.</p>
<p>One very common change is to the requirement to actually provide a body to the property-get and
property-set clauses; as is the case in Java, 95% of the time these clauses simply wrap around a field
and provide encapsulated access and nothing else. Which means, frankly, that the time spent writing
the implementation for these is pretty much a waste of time (and something that IDEA or other IDEs
can generate for us). The C# language designers agreed, and in C# 3.0 added the concept of “auto-
implemented properties,” which asks the C# compiler to not only generate the property method
implementations, but also synthesize the field used for the backing store. This simplifies the Person
class down to:</p>
<p>class Person
{
public string FirstName { get; set; }
public string LastName { get; set; }
public int Age { get; set; }</p>
<pre><code>public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)
{
    this.FirstName = fn;
    this.LastName = ln;
    this.Age = a;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>That’s…awfully terse. But what about those scenarios where we want to have the property available
to be read by anyone (public access), but only accessible for mutation from within the class (private
access)? The get and set clauses can have different levels of access, the most common idiom being:</p>
<p>class Person
{
public string FirstName { get; private set; }
public string LastName { get; private set; }
public int Age { get; private set; }</p>
<pre><code>public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)
{
    this.FirstName = fn;
    this.LastName = ln;
    this.Age = a;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>This will effectively make the fields immutable from the outside yet still something we can
change from the interior of the class. The field itself is synthesized by the compiler (usually with
a straightforward name such as “__$<Person>$<FirstName>@5417,” or something equally non-
obvious), and won’t be directly accessible by code. (Granted, one can always use System.Reflection—
the .NET direct equivalent to Java’s java.lang.reflect package—to access the field at runtime, but
that’s an awful lot of work to work around something that can be discarded at any time.) For those
rare situations where the auto-generated properties don’t do the right thing, C# developers can
always “drop back” to writing the property clauses out longhand and wrapping a declared field.</p>
<p>Methods, meanwhile, work pretty much the same way they do in Java, in terms of their declaration
and syntax. Methods can be instance methods or static (although static method invocations must
always go through the class name, whereas Java will allow calling a static method through an
instance variable—seriously, try it, it’s weird), and parameters are declared in order with a type and a
name:</p>
<p>public class Person
{
public string FirstName { get; set; }
public string LastName { get; set; }
public int Age { get; set; }</p>
<pre><code>public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)
{
</code></pre>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>this.FirstName = fn;
this.LastName = ln;
this.Age = a;
}
public void SayHello(string recipient)
{
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, {0}, I, {1}, say hello.&quot;,
recipient, FirstName);
}
}</p>
<p>class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args)
{
Person p = new Person(&quot;Ted&quot;, &quot;Neward&quot;, 46);
p.SayHello(&quot;Fred&quot;);
}
}</p>
<p>As you can see, C# follows pretty much exactly the same rules that Java does for method declaration
and invocation. But, again, C# allows for some interesting variations on this theme.</p>
<p>For starters, C# has had the concept of “method literals” since 1.0, though the syntax has changed
over each successive revision of the language. The first step was “delegates,” essentially the ability
to declare a method signature and then assign methods-on-object-instances to a given delegate
instance, like so:</p>
<p>class Person
{
// . . .
public delegate void HelloProc(string recipient);
public HelloProc IndirectSayHello;
}
class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args)
{
Person p = new Person(&quot;Ted&quot;, &quot;Neward&quot;, 46);
p.SayHello(&quot;Fred&quot;);</p>
<pre><code>    p.IndirectSayHello = p.SayHello;
    p.IndirectSayHello(&quot;Fred&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>This was a pretty verbose way of doing method-reference-capture, and with successive versions of
C#, they simplified it, particularly once the .NET platform introduced generics. (Yes, C# has generics,
yes they look syntactically almost identical to Java generics, but no, they don’t work the same way
when compiled—where Java uses “type erasure,” C# uses “reified generics” and persists the generic
definition all the way into the compiled bytecode.) The “delegate” keyword here introduces a new
type—a function pointer, if you will—and we can declare an instance of the delegate on the Person
class, assign a method to it, and invoke the assigned method through that delegate.</p>
<p>Lambdas, type inference, and extension classes
By the time C# 3.0 came around, however, C# supported full-bore lambda syntax, complete with
method parameter type inference, so that we could write method literals in-line:</p>
<pre><code>    p.IndirectSayHello = (recipient) =&gt; {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hey, {0}. Whatever.&quot;, recipient);
    };
    p.IndirectSayHello(&quot;Shaggy&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Lambdas turned out to be a major turning point within the C# language, along with several other
features of the C# 3.0 release, including local variable type inference, which simply allows for the
keyword “var” to appear in place of the type in a local variable declaration, like so:</p>
<pre><code>    var x = 12;
    var y = &quot;Fred&quot;;
    var z = p.IndirectSayHello;
    z(&quot;Wilma&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The “var” keyword does not, as some in the Java world theorized at its introduction, create an
untyped variable; the C# compiler simply infers the variable’s type from the right-hand-side
expression, and assigns that to the variable type. Thus, the “x” variable is strongly typed as an
integer (since that is an integer literally on the right-hand side), “y” is a string, and “z” is a delegate
that accepts a method reference that takes a single string parameter and returns void. All the
“var” keyword does, simply, is allow the C# developer a brief respite from having to type out type
signatures in places where the compiler could figure it out on its own.</p>
<p>On top of this, Microsoft also introduced a fascinating feature called “extension classes,” which has
found its way into other languages such as Swift. In short, a class can write “extension methods”
that can effectively “inject” themselves as method declarations onto other classes, adding new
functionality to classes already compiled. (It’s vaguely reminiscent of aspects as described by
AspectJ, but a strictly limited subset thereof.)</p>
<p>For example, assume that it’s becoming really common to want to count the number of words in
a given String. In the earliest days of Java, it was assumed that we could extend the String class to
add that kind of functionality, but Sun very quickly clamped down on that, made String final, and</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>earned the (short-lived) wrath of Java developers everywhere. Java developers were forced to write
“StringUtils” classes that had static methods on them to count the words in a string, similar to this C#
equivalent:</p>
<p>public class StringUtils
{
public static int WordCount(String str)
{
return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' },
StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
}
}</p>
<p>Frankly, though, using this left a pretty bitter taste in everybody’s mouth, since it smacked of doing
procedural programming. Java developers just learned to live with it; C# language designers said,
“We can go one step better.” If you agree that the class will never have any instance data and never
be instantiated as an instance (declare the class “static”), then it can use the first parameter to declare
a “this” parameter, and essentially declare a method that will appear on the targeted class, like so:</p>
<p>public static class MyStringExtensions
{
public static int WordCount(this String str)
{
return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' },
StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
}
}</p>
<p>(Note that “String” is shorthand for “System.String,” which is a synonym for the earlier type “string.”
All of the “primitive types” in C# are aliases for the System-namespaced types, so “int” is the same
as “System.Int32,” and so on. This has to do with how C# allows the declaration of “value types,” and
while a fascinating discussion in its own right, it’s a little out-of-scope from what we’re doing here.)</p>
<p>This extension class means that now we can write the following:</p>
<pre><code>    var words = &quot;One two three four&quot;;
    var wordCount = words.WordCount(); // 4
</code></pre>
<p>Extension classes don’t just magically apply everywhere, however—they must be brought into scope
via the use of the “using” statements, so that if we don’t care to use the MyStringExtensions, the
WordCount() method won’t appear on String types. And the original class remains unaffected, which
means that the WordCount() extension (like all extensions) cannot have any impact on the internals
of the extended class—in fact, it can’t see any of the internal members, and so can only ever be able
to use the public interface of the extended class. It’s purely compiler syntactic sugar.</p>

<p>Language-INtegrated Query (LINQ)
All of this led up to one of the signature moments for the C# compiler with the 3.0 release:
Language-INtegrated Query, or LINQ, for short. To many in the Java community, LINQ represented
everything that was wrong with Microsoft, accusing them of “embedding SQL into the C# language”
and turning C# into a 4GL that was proprietarily bound to SQL Server. As the Jedi Master put it,
“Amazing—every single part of that sentence is entirely incorrect.” LINQ wasn’t integrating SQL, it
isn’t about SQL Server, and it’s actually built up around core language principles that had nothing to
do with relational databases, much less integrated with SQL Server.</p>
<p>Let’s start by examining a simple collection of Person objects in a list:</p>
<pre><code>    var people = new List&lt;Person&gt;() {
        new Person(&quot;Ted&quot;, &quot;Neward&quot;, 45),
        new Person(&quot;Charlotte&quot;, &quot;Neward&quot;, 39),
        new Person(&quot;Michael&quot;, &quot;Neward&quot;, 24),
        new Person(&quot;Matthew&quot;, &quot;Neward&quot;, 18),
        new Person(&quot;Beth&quot;, &quot;Massi&quot;, 39),
        new Person(&quot;Dustin&quot;, &quot;Campbell&quot;, 43)
    };
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose I want to give everybody within this list a beer. Sharp readers will notice, of course, that my
youngest son is not yet eligible to receive a beer, and this is a family-friendly article, so we don’t want
to get into trouble with the local authorities.</p>
<p>Were this a discussion of Java8 lambdas, we would talk about using lambdas and streams to filter
the collection before applying a higher-order function across each to give each individual a beer.
(If that’s new to you, Venkat Subramaniam has some great conference lectures online that describe
Java8 lambdas in more detail.) As far back as C# 3.0, Microsoft saw the need, and chose not only to
layer functional principles into the language, but to put a syntax in place that would actually hide the
fact that this was ever functional programming in the first place:</p>
<pre><code>    var drinkers =
        from p in people
        where p.Age &gt; 21
        select p;
</code></pre>
<p>This is a LINQ query expression, and despite the fact that it looks similar to SQL, it’s actually invoking
several functional methods in sequence using a fluent interface; translated out of the SQL-like syntax,
it looks more like:</p>
<pre><code>         drinkers = people.Where((p) =&gt; p.Age &gt; 21);
</code></pre>
<p>All of the traditional functional operations are present here—map, filter, and the rest—but they
“hide” behind this query expression syntax. We’ll talk more about the interesting features and
implications of LINQ when we get to Entity Framework in the last section, but for now, just think of</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>LINQ as a syntax that is designed to deliberately bring some of the set-oriented nature of SQL and the
functional-oriented nature of languages such as Haskell into the C# language as a first-class citizen.</p>
<p>(For anybody who really wants to see LINQ taken to an absolute extreme, it can be instructional to
look at Luke Hoban’s “single-LINQ-expression-ray-tracer” blog post from 10 years ago, available at
https://aka.ms/linqraytracer. It will send chills down your back, one way or another.)</p>
<p>Asynchronous programming with Async/Await
C# 4.0 introduced a number of interesting features, but C# 5.0 truly bucked the status quo by
introducing language support for a form of asynchronous programming via the “async” and “await”
keywords. While not a general-purpose, all-around concurrency feature, async/await added the
ability to easily add “little concurrency” into common programming tasks such as issuing a request
for a database query or executing a Web API request without having to manually manage the
threads necessary to do so without blocking. Leveraging some work done elsewhere on the .NET
platform (the Task Parallel Library, or TPL), C# essentially now allows developers to start some work
and return a Task<T> object, which represents that additional work. At the source code level, “async”
can decorate either a method signature or an anonymous method literal to indicate it should run
asynchronously, and “await” tells the compiler to generate the code necessary to hold things in place
until the asynchronous code completes. (Essentially, these are language-level implementations of
“promises,” which are permeating the JavaScript world and slowly starting to gather steam in the Java
world as well, under the name “CompletableFuture” out of the java.util.concurrent package in Java8.)</p>
<p>async Task PlaySongsAsync(int[] ids)
{
foreach (var id in ids)
{
try
{
var data = await service.GetEncodedDataAsync(id);
var song = await Task.Run(() =&gt; Decode(data));
await PlayAsync(song);
}
catch (Exception e) { /* just skip the song */ }
}
}</p>
<p>There is much, much more we can discuss with respect to C#, but then we’d have no time to talk
about anything else, and there is much, much more to go over on our tour. Fortunately, Microsoft has
a great collection of web resources on the language, starting with a page that lists an overall history
of the language, available at https://aka.ms/csharpwhatsnew, and a general (if abbreviated) overview
of the language available at https://aka.ms/csharptour. And, of course, there’re books. Lots and lots
of books.</p>
<p>But once you know how to write code in this language, what can you do with it?</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Frameworks, for the Win!</p>
<p>By far and away, the most popular thing to do with C# and the .NET runtime is to build a web
application of some form, just as it is with the Java language and runtime. To be sure, the .NET
ecosystem supports more than this—one can build desktop applications, mobile applications, and
even games (using the aforementioned Unity framework, among others), but the lion’s share of code
written in C# is web applications.</p>
<p>Like its twin, .NET offers a comprehensive framework of web functionality, ranging all the way
from drag-and-drop-built user interface, to MVC-based server-side rendering, to the construction
of HTTP-based APIs for invocation by single-page applications written in JavaScript or mobile
applications. Somewhat confusingly, however, all three are referred to by the name “ASP.NET.”</p>
<p>(Note to those who recognize the “ASP” moniker from the early days of the Sun/Microsoft rivalry: In
the COM days, Microsoft’s web technology was called “Active Server Pages,” ASP for short, named
after ActiveX, one of the marketing names for COM. When Microsoft started working on the CLR
internally, one of its most important consumers was the ASP team, who sought to create a system
similar to JSP to replace ASP. Since the effort was to redo ASP in .NET, the name “ASP.NET” was
coined. However, aside from the basic notion that “this is for the web,” there’s little to no relationship
between ASP.NET and its predecessor.)</p>
<p>The ASP.NET “family” is fundamentally broken into three parts, two of which we’ll examine here (in
brief):</p>
<p>•  ASP.NET WebForms, the first flavor of ASP.NET, released with .NET 1.0, featuring drag-and-drop
user interface construction. It was designed to try to bring a VisualBasic-style design philosophy
to the web, but by .NET 3.0, the Microsoft community had come to understand the design
advantages of an MVC-style design approach, and all work on WebForms essentially ceased.
Ironically, about the time that interest in WebForms was ending, the Java community was building
up JSF, the equivalent to WebForms in Java.</p>
<p>•  ASP.NET MVC: Based on the classic “Model-View-Controller” principles that the Sun “Model 2”</p>
<p>design for servlets and JSP first laid out, Microsoft created ASP.NET MVC, released the source code
for it shortly after its initial release, and has considered this to be its first-class server-side web
framework ever since. ASP.NET MVC was rebranded (and refactored) to be “ASP.NET Core MVC” in
2015, in keeping with the “.NET Core” naming for the cross-platform runtime, and has made some
conceptual shifts as new frameworks—such as Ruby-on-Rails—gained popularity and created
some new patterns (such as routing tables).</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>•  ASP.NET MVC Web API: While the name certainly gets no points for brevity, it does accurately
reflect the idea that this framework is built off of the same concepts that underlie the ASP.NET
MVC library, but with the intent of producing JSON data instead of HTML. When ASP.NET MVC was
tagged with the “Core” moniker, the “MVC” was formally dropped from Web API projects, so that
now they are simply “ASP.NET Core Web API,” or more informally, “Web API” projects.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a quick ASP.NET Core Web API application—the ubiquitous TODO list—and then
we’ll have a quick look at an MVC application before we look at Microsoft’s data-storage framework,
Entity Framework.</p>
<p>ASP.NET Core Web API
To get started with Core Web API, we first need to scaffold out the Web API template; this can be
done either via “File|New” in one of the Visual Studio IDEs, or from the command-line using the .NET
Core CLI tools by executing “dotnet new webapi -o todoapi.” This will create a subdirectory called
“todoapi” and install the .NET Core Web API project inside of it. Out of the box, it scaffolds out a
simple API that has one controller to hand back arbitrary “value” objects, accessible at
http://localhost:5000/api/values. Before we make any changes to the code, it’s always good to make
sure the scaffold is working, so execute a “dotnet run” from within the “todoapi” directory, and
navigate to the given URL; the response should be a dirt-simple JSON array containing two strings.</p>
<p>A Web API project, like its cousin the MVC application, is broken into models and controllers, with
the “view” assumed to be an automated conversion from a model object into JSON. Thus, in a Web
API project, the goal will be to accept incoming requests, perform the necessary business logic, and
return the appropriate model type, usually corresponding to the resource type in the URL, to be
converted to JSON.</p>
<p>The Controllers directory contains the code for the ValuesController, which is the default-scaffolded
code. It doesn’t use any model objects, which means it’s clearly inferior. Let’s delete it, and replace it
with something that’s a little more “MV”-like. That means, first of all, that we need a model object to
represent a TODO item, which is a pretty simple domain object:</p>
<p>public class Todo
{
public long ID { get; set; }
public string Description { get; set; }
public bool Completed { get; set; }</p>
<pre><code>public Todo()
{
    Completed = false;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>(Note that it would be a bit irregular to call this a POJO, since it’s not a Java object, but that’s basically
exactly what this is. These are sometimes referred to as Plain Old C# Objects, POCOs, or, less often,
Plain Old DotNet Objects or PODNOs. Definitely doesn’t roll off the tongue like POJOs, but we do
what we can.)</p>
<p>Having a domain object, it now remains to build a controller that will respond to the appropriate
URL (which, by convention, will be prefixed by “/api,” but is of course configurable). The Web API
expectation is that a controller will be a class that has a number of public methods that obey some
conventions, in terms of both method names and parameter sets, like Java has done with later
versions of the Servlet and EJB specifications.</p>
<pre><code>[Route(&quot;api/[controller]&quot;)]
public class TodosController : Controller
{
    private List&lt;Todo&gt; todos = new List&lt;Todo&gt;() {
      new Todo() { ID=0, Description=&quot;Get milk&quot;, Completed=true },
      new Todo() { ID=1, Description=&quot;Get pet food&quot; },
      new Todo() { ID=2, Description=&quot;Learn .NET Core&quot; },
      new Todo() { ID=3, Description=&quot;Write billion-dollar app&quot; }
    };

    // GET api/todos
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable&lt;Todo&gt; Get()
    {
        return todos;
    }

    // GET api/todos/5
    [HttpGet(&quot;{id}&quot;)]
    public Todo Get(int id)
    {
        return todos.First((t) =&gt; t.ID == id);
    }

    // POST api/todos
    [HttpPost]
    public void Post([FromBody]Todo value)
    {
        todos.Add(value);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>// PUT api/todos/5
[HttpPut(&quot;{id}&quot;)]
public void Put(int id, [FromBody]Todo value)
{
var todo = todos.First((t) =&gt; t.ID == id);
todo.Description = value.Description;
todo.Completed = value.Completed;
}</p>
<pre><code>    // DELETE api/todos/5
    [HttpDelete(&quot;{id}&quot;)]
    public void Delete(int id)
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>To understand this class, it’s important to understand a few things: First, the square-bracketed
declarations outside each method are what .NET calls “custom attributes,” which, true story, figured
prominently in the design for JSR-175 annotations. The attributes provide information (via reflection,
same way annotations do) about how HTTP verbs should match against the methods—so, for
example, the ASP.NET runtime can know that the two Get() methods should both be invoked when
an incoming GET request is made.</p>
<p>The other half of that binding, of course, is knowing the partial URL pattern that should trigger the
method. Notice that the controller class itself has an attribute, “Routing,” which contains the string
“api/[controller].” The square-bracketed “controller” is to tell the ASP.NET runtime to use the name
of the class, minus its “-Controller” suffix, so the URL pattern for all of these API endpoints is “api/
todos.” From here, standard REST conventions kick in—a GET to “api/todos” should return all of the
TODO items, so the Get() method taking no parameters and returning an IEnumerable<Todo> (think
of it as a high-level iterator interface) is the right one to invoke here. If, on the other hand, a caller
wants a single TODO, they’ll issue a request with a URL pattern of “api/todos/” plus the ID of the
TODO requested. The second Get() method indicates that the URL pattern includes “{id},” so “api/
todos/3” will extract “3” and pass it for the value of “id” to the method. Ditto for the Put and Delete
methods.</p>
<p>The full details of routing are in the ASP.NET documentation, but this should be sufficient to
understand what’s happening here. To see the new controller in action, just do a “dotnet run” from
the “todoapi” directory, and point an HTTP client (curl or Postman) at http://localhost:5000/api/todos
to see the JSON representations handed back.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>ASP.NET Core MVC
HTTP-based APIs are nice, but when we need a traditional server-side rendered application, ASP.NET
provides a traditional MVC framework called (not surprisingly) ASP.NET Core MVC. It’s the same MVC
we find in most modern web frameworks; views are rendered using a particular template syntax,
called “Razor” (or “Razor pages”) that is designed to be expressive yet terse. It’s a syntax inspired
from other similar frameworks, particularly JSP and Ruby-on-Rails, but also tried to be reasonably
familiar to generations of ASP and ASP.NET WebForms developers. Controllers look almost the same
as they do in the API scenario, and models, of course, are just C# classes representing the domain.</p>
<p>Razor templates use a .cshtml extension, and like JSP, they use different syntax to indicate which
parts of the page are to be interpreted in a code-aware manner, as opposed to being taken literally
as output format. Razor syntax uses the “@” symbol to set off code blocks or other processing
statements in several different ways; for example, to do a simple “for” loop within a page, Razor uses
an “@for” to set off the loop. Unlike JSP, however, the Razor syntax is clear enough that there isn’t a
need to require explicit symbols to set off between code and HTML output:</p>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<ul>
    @for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        <li>Beetlejuice</li>
    }
</ul>
<p>Views, of course, can make use of objects and data provided by a controller, often by making use
of a predefined key-value map called ViewData. If we want the message and the number of times
it should be printed to be set up by a controller (perhaps the controller is obtaining it from HTML
query parameters or a database), then the controller can set those by using the keys “Message” and
“NumTimes” in the ViewData dictionary, respectively. The view can then display them like this:</p>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<ul>
    @for (int i = 0; i < (int)ViewData["NumTimes"]; i++)
    {
        <li>@ViewData["Message"]</li>
    }
</ul>
<p>In essence, ViewData is the ASP.NET equivalent to Servlet “request” scope.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>The controller perspective that drives this looks remarkably similar to what a servlet controller would
do, with a few differences:</p>
<p>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Text.Encodings.Web;</p>
<p>namespace MvcMovie.Controllers
{
public class HelloWorldController : Controller
{
public IActionResult Welcome(string name, int numTimes = 1)
{
ViewData[&quot;Message&quot;] = &quot;Hello &quot; + name;
ViewData[&quot;NumTimes&quot;] = numTimes;</p>
<pre><code>        return View();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>Notice that the Welcome method takes two parameters, which will be filled in from HTML query
parameters, fills in the ViewData dictionary, and then calls “View,” which then looks for a Razor page
file whose name matches that of the method—in this case, it will be looking for “Welcome.cshtml.”
ASP.NET Core MVC has a number of ways to adjust and change these conventions, but out of the
box, the convention-based approach makes it simpler and easier than the configuration descriptor
approach of older Servlet versions.</p>
<p>ASP.NET Core MVC obviously consists of a great deal more than just what we’ve discussed here, but
the underlying message should be clear: ASP.NET Core (both the MVC and the Web API versions)
learned a great deal from its contemporaries, including those in the Servlet world (JSP, the Play
framework, and more), and as such, it will be very straightforward for a Java developer to pick up and
explore.</p>
<p>For those interested in a deeper dive into the code above, consider having a look into this tutorial:
https://aka.ms/first-web-api.</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Entity Framework Core
Of course, being able to access the server and pass JSON back and forth is only half the story; the
other half is taking that data and storing it. Or rather, storing it, indexing it, searching it, collating
it, sorting it, drawing pretty graphs with it, and more. When working with a relational database,
the technology Microsoft offers its .NET constituents is called Entity Framework, or EF, and in many
respects it works like any other object/relational mapping framework does. Thanks to some of the
language features in C#, however, in many cases working with EF is actually easier than working with
JPA or Hibernate.</p>
<p>Like much in the .NET universe, Entity Framework is undergoing a bit of a reshuffle; what used to
be a closed, proprietary source base is now open, and as EF was opened to the world, the project
owners thought a (slight) rebrand seemed appropriate. As a result, the open-source version of EF is
called “Entity Framework Core,” and to begin using it, we need to install it into the project via NuGet,
either by using the Package Manager in Visual Studio, or by using the command-line for .NET Core by
entering:</p>
<p>dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer</p>
<p>This is, of course, assuming we are using SQLServer—since not everybody uses SQL Server, however,
a number of different EF database providers are available, including MySQL, Postgres, SQLite,
Firebase, and a few more. (Third-party vendors are constantly introducing new ones, in a manner
similar to the JDBC driver ecosystem, so bear in mind that Microsoft may not even know all the EF
providers in the world.)</p>
<p>There’re a few “management” tasks that will be easier to do from the command-line, and EF has a
command-line package that installs “inside” the standard .NET Core command-line tool, but as of this
writing, making use of it requires adding a line by hand to the project’s .csproj file:</p>
<ItemGroup>
  <DotNetCliToolReference
     Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet"
     Version="2.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
<p>In addition, the EF Core command-ling tooling requires another dependent package:</p>
<p>dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design</p>
<p>At this point, EF should be installed and ready to go. More detailed instructions can be found on the
Microsoft docs site at https://aka.ms/ef-install.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the most critical element to using EF from a project is the DbContext. This is a class
from which a project will create a derived class that represents the “context” for this project against
the database—it will be a repository, session, and gateway, all rolled into one. Like many object/
relational tools, it also provides some core behavior, including some migration capabilities (database
versioning).</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Like Hibernate or JPA, EF uses classes to represent entities in the database, and these classes are
often referred to as “model” objects, since they typically serve that purpose in an MVC and/or Web
API application. These will usually look like “plain old C# objects,” with the odd custom attribute to
help give EF some additional hints about how to map to the database table they represent.</p>
<p>For example, if the application is a blog, then we will want classes representing a blog, and blog
post, representing a single blog entry. But there’s also some blog metadata we might want to track
that wouldn’t be appropriate to store in the database (such as whether the blog was stored in the
database), which we will want Entity Framework to ignore entirely. One way to do this is to use a
custom attribute, or the EF Fluent API can indicate that the blog metadata class should be ignored
using the “OnModelCreating” method, invoked when the database schema is created.</p>
<p>public class BloggingContext : DbContext
{
public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }</p>
<pre><code>protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Ignore&lt;BlogMetadata&gt;();
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>public class Blog
{
public int BlogId { get; set; }
public string Url { get; set; }</p>
<pre><code>public List&lt;Post&gt; Posts { get; set; }

public BlogMetadata Metadata { get; set; }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>public class Post
{
public int PostId { get; set; }
public string Title { get; set; }
public string Content { get; set; }</p>
<pre><code>public Blog Blog { get; set; }
</code></pre>
<p>}
public class BlogMetadata
{
public DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; }
}</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>The “Id” fields, of course, are typically primary key integer columns in the database, and the List
of Posts is a classic one-to-many relationship. All of this will be eminently familiar to any user of
Hibernate, JPA, or other object-relational modeling system. What will be different will be the way in
which queries and modifiers are run; thanks to LINQ, Entity Framework uses an entirely new style of
query starting from the DbSet fields modeled on the DbContext-inheriting class. To do a query to
fetch all the blogs from the system, we simply create an instance of the context inside of a “using”
block (which is the inspiration for the try-with-resources block in Java7), and use that instance to
obtain the set of Blog instances and iterate through them:</p>
<p>using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
foreach (var blog in context.Blogs) {
// do something with the blog
}
}</p>
<p>Contrary to what we experienced during the heyday of EJB Entity Beans, however, this isn’t a case
of early loading or late loading; under the hood, Entity Framework is making use of “enumerator
objects” (very similar to Java8 streams and the Java Iterable<T> interface) to fetch objects in batches,
just as a typical database cursor would do.</p>
<p>In the Java world, however, filtering that list of blogs to include only those that have “dotnet” in
the URL presented problems—either the filtering happens on the database side, in which case the
query has to be translated to SQL, or the filtering happens on the client side, which means the entire
collection has to be brought over the network. With LINQ, however, this looks like this:</p>
<p>using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
foreach (var blog in context.Blogs
.Where(b =&gt; b.Url.Contains(&quot;dotnet&quot;))) {
// do something with the blog
}
}</p>
<p>But this has the same drawbacks as before; instead, we can use an “expression tree,” a feature of
LINQ that compiles into a runtime structure that reflects the compiled code:</p>
<p>using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
var allDotnetBlogUrls = from blog in context.Blogs
where blog.Url.Contains(&quot;dotnet&quot;)
select blog.Url;</p>
<p>.NET for Java Developers</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>foreach (var url in allDotnetBlogUrls) {
// do something with the blog URL
// note we don't have the entire Blog, just the Url
}
}</p>
<p>This “from-where-select” syntax that looks so much like SQL isn’t; it’s a syntax that’s designed to look
similar to SQL and offer many of the same kinds of operators and options. However, this isn’t an SQL
query—it will not be sent to the database. Instead, the expression tree is analyzed—and optimized—
by the EF plumbing to generate an efficient SQL statement, on a driver-by-driver basis. This means
that the query filters and restrictions are analyzed on the client side, but sent to the database to be
executed—for example, the above turns into a “SELECT url FROM blog WHERE…” using whatever
primitives to do a string-containment check that the database and EF provider offers. This is really
the best-of-both-worlds scenario. Couple that with the compile-time type checking that the C#
compiler provides against the model objects, and you have a solution that is entirely new to the Java
world. (Not impossible to provide, mind you, but still something the Java world currently lacks.)</p>
<p>Updates and modifications entail making modifications on the model object, and those changes
will be sent to the database when the context object goes out of the using block’s scope. To add
a new blog, construct the object and add it to the DbSet on the context object; to remove it, use
the context’s DbSet again. And should you really, really want to write raw SQL, the context object
provides that capacity.</p>
<p>There is, of course, much more to discuss about Entity Framework—it’s every bit as rich and powerful
as JPA, and as such, definitely larger than just what we can cover in a single paper. For more examples
of LINQ syntax, check out https://aka.ms/101LinqSamples. For 101 LINQ samples, and for more
information on Entity Framework itself, head over to the EF documentation home at https://docs.

<p>38</p>
<p>Wrapping Up</p>
<p>To suggest that this is somehow the end of the story is ludicrous. The .NET ecosystem holds a rich
tapestry of open-source projects and commercial tools and frameworks, and that means that a
developer could, if they wished, spend their entire career just discovering the boundaries there. We
haven’t even begun to discuss the alternative languages for the .NET platform, either from Microsoft
(F#, an object/functional hybrid that fills the same role as Scala, or good old Visual Basic, one of the
original dynamic languages) or from the community (check out Boo, a Python-inspired dynamic
language). We haven’t begun to explore the different open-source frameworks that do dependency
injection. We haven’t begun to explore the different frameworks for doing unit testing, or the online
tooling from Microsoft to provide agile project support. We haven’t even mentioned Azure.</p>
<p>This is a brave new land, intrepid adventurer, but rest easy: Much of what you know from your time
in the world of Java will serve you well here. The concepts are similar, but different enough to be
interesting. The platforms are powerful, and the communities open and inviting. The tools are easily
obtained, and the tutorials plenty. You might even recognize a few familiar names, those who have
come before you across the pond and gone on this adventure before you. Be the tourist, if you like,
but know that there’s plenty of room to build your own home and settle down here, even if it’s only a
