It was\\ncalled .NET, it would be the backbone for their u\", \"pcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would\\nbe a part of their data management system (nickna\", \"med \\u201cSQLServer.NET\\u201d), and it would form the\\ncore development platform for building interconnected ap\", \"plications into the future by leveraging\\nemerging standards such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few other\", \"s the world had not yet really come to\\nunderstand. It would be the principal competitor platform to \", \"their principal development rival at the\\ntime, Sun Microsystems, and its Java platform. And the worl\", \"d could see that the shot was fired, the\\nline in the sand drawn, and the armies drawn up; clearly, t\", \"his was Microsoft copying the efforts of its\\ncompetitors, seeking dominance, and\\u2026.\\n\\n\\nAnd most of the\", \" world completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it had come to\\nexist, and what Microso\", \"ft really sought to obtain from it.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, it\\u2019s fair to suggest that many within the Microsoft e\", \"cosystem misunderstood what .NET was\\nreally about; once announced, the marketing machine took over. \", \"Much effort was wasted due to the\\nentanglement of \\u201c.NET\\u201d with \\u201cweb services,\\u201d and it would take the \", \"better part of a decade before\\npeople could understand that the two really had nothing intrinsically\", \" to do with one another any\\nmore than \\u201cPerl\\u201d did with \\u201cdatabases.\\u201d Microsoft management compounded a\", \"ll this confusion by\\nre\\u2011branding the \\u201c.NET\\u201d suffix to a number of their products, which they later c\", \"orrected but well after\\nthe damage had been done.\\n\\n\\nBut despite all that, solid engineering rests at\", \" the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made\\nit harder to see, but it\\u2019s always been there\", \". To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its\\nproper historical context: that, in tr\", \"uth, it was the simple \\u201cnext step\\u201d along an evolutionary chain that\\nstretched back much further than\", \" that October keynote almost two decades ago.\\n\\n## Of components, managed environments, and code\\n\\nIn \", \"the beginning, there was C.\\n\\n\\nTo be more accurate about it, in the beginning a number of programming\", \" languages were created\\nto make it easier to produce programs that knew how to execute on a single c\", \"hip. They integrated\\ndirectly with the hardware, making use of the facilities there to obtain memory\", \", interact with the\\ndisk, and present data to the display for the user to understand. In time, we as\", \" an industry found that\\nthis direct-hardware interaction had its drawbacks, and we sought to create \", \"a series of abstractions\\non top of that hardware, to help coordinate the use of the hardware across \", \"multiple simultaneously\\n\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers 3\\n\\n\\nexecuting programs. We called that first atte\", \"mpt at regulating and managing the hardware an\\noperating system. And it was pretty good. So good, in\", \" fact, that numerous flavors of operating\\nsystem were born, including Microsoft\\u2019s Windows operating \", \"system, and Solaris, and macOS (though\\nit was called \\u201cSystem 7\\u201d back then), and Linux, and a few oth\", \"ers whose names exist now only in the\\nhistory books and dusty corners of Usenet forums. (Bonus point\", \"s if you recognize these names:\\nMinix, Mach, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even more bonus points if yo\", \"u ever ran one of them. If you\\never ran DOS, though, it just means you\\u2019re old.)\\n\\n\\nThe bigger, more i\", \"mportant issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system\\nitself\\u2014that program\", \"mers found it helpful and useful to have \\u201csomething else\\u201d working with their\\nprograms. That \\u201csomethi\", \"ng else\\u201d would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs\\nexecuted and behaved, rather t\", \"han assuming that every single nuance had to be the programmers\\u2019\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n\\nThis concept, in \", \"large, is essentially that of a \\u201cmanaged environment.\\u201d Although it has its roots\\nin operating system\", \"s, it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of\\ncontainers and cloud: th\", \"at there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are\\nresponsible for details \", \"that the programmer doesn\\u2019t want to have to deal with. Operating systems\\nare managed environments in\", \" that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to\\nschedule the execution of thr\", \"eads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network\\nports or data files. Virtual m\", \"achines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in\\nthat they regulate the access a\", \"nd reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode\\nformat into CPU-native instruction\", \"s, and prevent the direct access of memory (except under very\\nspecific circumstances) in order to av\", \"oid process termination by careless programming. Containers\\nsuch as Docker are managed environments \", \"in that they provide a context around an executable\\nto mimic a precise environment\\u2014configuration fil\", \"es, environment variables, and shared network\\nsettings\\u2014so that developers can be assured that the en\", \"vironment outside their programs are\\nconsistent regardless of where they are deployed.\\n\\n\\nBy the earl\", \"y \\u201990s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for\\nWindows developers t\", \"o be able to take \\u201cthe next step forward\\u201d in development evolution. The \\u201cGUI\\nrevolution\\u201d of the mid-\", \"\\u201980s was largely finished; programs weren\\u2019t just about \\u201cdialogs and data,\\u201d\\nbut now needed to integra\", \"te more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for\\nexample) and start taking ad\", \"vantage of networking in greater detail. (Old developers like me will\\nremember that it was around 19\", \"95 that references to HTTP and \\u201cthe World Wide Web\\u201d were just\\nstarting to appear in publications and\", \" technology journals.)\\n\\n\\nAs is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges emerged. \", \"C++ developers\\nhad been speaking of \\u201creusable code\\u201d for several years, but it was Visual Basic (and \", \"Delphi, along with\\nseveral other \\u201c4GL\\u201d variants) that demonstrated actual practical code reuse, in t\", \"he form of \\u201ccontrols\\u201d:\\nwidgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly without re\", \"quiring in-depth\\nknowledge about the controls\\u2019 implementation. Simply obtain the library, put it int\", \"o the right place\\nwithin the development environment, drag-and-drop the control into the constructio\", \"n area, and lo,\\nthe developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of \\u201capplication\", \" frameworks,\\u201d\\nlike MFC and OWL, but \\u201cGUI builders\\u201d had demonstrated that the concept of \\u201ccontrols\\u201d c\", \"ould be\\nleveraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and events; \", \"now\\n\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers 4\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the big\", \"ger world beyond GUI development.\\nMore importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship\\u2014mak\", \"e it possible for outside\\ndevelopers to build \\u201cthings\\u201d that could be used by existing things (such a\", \"s the operating system or,\\nperhaps, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their implementat\", \"ion.\\n\\n\\nTo do that, they needed to create a managed environment that would work across a variety of\\nd\", \"ifferent languages, but all operating under the same rules. That effort, called the Component\\nObject\", \" Model (COM), was the first of several \\u201cmanaged platforms\\u201d that emerged during the earlyand mid-\\u201990s\", \". (Ironically, several open-source efforts would go after this same space many years\\nafter Microsoft\", \" declared COM \\u201cfinished,\\u201d including Mozilla\\u2019s XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in\\nthat it became th\", \"e backbone of Windows development for a significant percentage of the Windows\\nplatform. But it still\", \" failed in that it left programs vulnerable to many of the same things that had\\nplagued them before:\", \" memory leaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpected process termination at\\nthe first mistake. It was \", \"clear that, despite the managed platform, writing code in a \\u201cnative\\u201d language\\n(such as C/C++ or Delp\", \"hi) still wasn\\u2019t a particularly great place to be.\\n\\n\\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that S\", \"un Microsystems demonstrated the HotJava browser\\nto the world, the centerpiece of which was this lan\", \"guage that could be used to write executable\\nbits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft had \", \"come to the realization that this was what it\\nwas missing: a \\u201cmanaged language\\u201d to run on top of the\", \"ir managed platform. A managed language\\nhad exactly the right \\u201cdistance\\u201d from the underlying operati\", \"ng system they were seeking\\u2014garbage\\ncollection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashe\", \"s, and the virtual machine could\\nhelp enforce stronger security controls that the world had just sta\", \"rted to realize they needed. It was,\\nin many ways, a perfect match. Microsoft invested resources int\", \"o building their own JVM, extended\\ntheir IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrat\", \"ed COM into the runtime.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own\", \" destruction.\\n\\n## Hello, .NET\\n\\nDivorces are never a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one \", \"is always fraught with opinion,\\nrevisionist history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997\", \"/1998, two facts were becoming clear:\\none, Sun didn\\u2019t care for Microsoft\\u2019s work increasing interoper\", \"ability between their JVM and native\\nCOM components in Windows [1], and two, Microsoft and Java were\", \" going to part ways, one way or\\nanother. (Who got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)\\n\\n\\nEith\", \"er certain groups within Microsoft could see the writing on the wall or they had come to find\\nissues\", \" (real or perceived) with the Java Virtual Machine; either way, by 1998, a new effort came to\\nlife i\", \"nside of Microsoft, designed to bring a new managed platform and managed language into the\\nworld. Or\", \"iginally intended as the successor to COM, it went through a variety of names, including\\n\\n\\n1 For the\", \" curious, Microsoft offered additional platform-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with nat\", \"ive\\nCOM components. The irony of this is deep, considering that Sun had actually allowed for COM-spe\", \"cific\\nnative interfaces in their JNI specification\\u2014the first three methods in the interface table fo\", \"r a JNIEnv (\\u201cJNI\\nenvironment\\u201d) object were specifically left \\u201creserved\\u201d for the necessary three meth\", \"ods (AddRef, Release, and\\nQueryInterface) of every COM interface object. Those three slots are still\", \" reserved to this day.\\n\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers 5\\n\\n\\n\\u201cCOM+,\\u201d the \\u201cComponent Object Runtime\\u201d (COR), \", \"the \\u201cUniversal RunTime\\u201d (URT), and \\u201cNextGeneration Windows Services\\u201d (NGWS) before finally being int\", \"roduced to the world as \\u201c.NET\\u201d at that\\nOctober 2000 PDC. Along with it would come a new language, co\", \"de-named \\u201cCOOL\\u201d (supposedly\\nto stand for the \\u201cComponent-Oriented Object Language,\\u201d although opinions\", \" vary now) and later\\nrenamed \\u201cC#.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nWhile most observers considered C# and the CLR (the Common Lang\", \"uage Runtime, the virtual\\nmachine executing the bytecode) to be direct competitors of Java, Microsof\", \"t took careful steps to\\nensure that it was \\u201copen\\u201d in ways that Java was not: where the JVM was desig\", \"ned from the beginning\\nto be a virtual machine for a single language, the CLR embraced a more polygl\", \"ot approach, with\\nMicrosoft even going so far as to recruit several universities and companies to cr\", \"eate new languages\\nfor this platform and/or adapt existing ones. This project, nicknamed \\u201cProject 7\\u201d\", \" (for the 7 groups\\nthat participated), debuted several of these languages during .NET\\u2019s introduction\", \", and included CLR\\nflavors of Eiffel, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of these languages gained any tra\", \"ction after the first\\nfew years of existence, and most no longer exist, but their presence had the e\", \"ffect on Microsoft of\\n\\u201ckeeping them honest\\u201d with respect to other languages beyond C# and Visual Bas\", \"ic as the platform\\ngrew and evolved. (Microsoft itself would later go on to introduce a number of ne\", \"w CLR-based\\nlanguages, including a compiled-to-binary version of ECMAScript, two different efforts a\", \"t bringing\\nmanaged coding to C++, a hybrid object/functional language called F#, and several more re\", \"search\\nlanguages.)\\n\\n\\nHowever, Microsoft also sought to make sure that .NET was not a proprietary eff\", \"ort by investing\\nthousands of man-hours into the creation of a series of international specification\", \"s\\u2014through the\\nEuropean Computer Manufacturer\\u2019s Association (ECMA [2] )\\u2014to ensure that C# and the und\", \"erlying\\nplatform were both open industry standards. C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and th\", \"e\\nunderlying runtime was given the name the \\u201cCommon Language Infrastructure\\u201d (CLI), and accepted\\nand\", \" ratified as ECMA-335. Intel, HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in\\nkeepin\", \"g these specifications up to date with changes to the language and the platform, the most\\nrecent upd\", \"ates [3] coming in 2012 for the CLI and 2017 for C#.\\n\\n\\nWith the introduction of these specifications\", \" in 2001 came an unexpected side-effect: members of\\nthe open-source community began to examine build\", \"ing a \\u201cclean-room\\u201d implementation of them.\\nWhile the CLI Specification didn\\u2019t include any of the Win\", \"dows-specific features (such as a deep COM\\nintegration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility\", \" and forwards-evolution for their existing\\ndeveloper base, the CLI Specification itself provided eno\", \"ugh integration points to make it interesting\\nto implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of G\", \"NOME fame, began one such project, calling\\nit Mono.\\n\\n\\nThe specification also gave Microsoft some roo\", \"m to do what some within the company had been\\nlooking to do for quite a while: provide a research an\", \"d experimentation vehicle for the academic and\\nresearch communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft r\", \"eleased a stripped-down version of the CLR\\nsource code, code-named \\u201cRotor,\\u201d distributed under an ope\", \"n-source license they created, called the\\n\\n\\n2 ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification \", \"for the language commonly known as \\u201cJavaScript,\\u201d but is\\nmore rightly called \\u201cECMAScript,\\u201d governed a\", \"s ECMA-262.\\n\\n[3 CLI: https://www.iso.org/standard/58046.html](https://www.iso.org/standard/58046.htm\", \"l) [and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/](http://www.ecma-international.org\", \"/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm)\\n[Ecma-335.htm; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/publicati\", \"ons/standards/Ecma-334.htm](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm)\\n\\n\", \"\\n.NET for Java Developers 6\\n\\n\\n\\u201cShared Source\\u201d license, giving it the formal name \\u201cShared Source CLI\\u201d\", \" or \\u201cSSCLI.\\u201d While Mono would\\nremain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, a\", \"nd Rotor of even less interest to\\nthose outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source minds\", \"et were sown. Over time, Mono\\nwould be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own company, Xama\", \"rin, which would faithfully\\nparallel the work described by the specifications and periodically try o\", \"ut new ideas for the opensource community to consider.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft officially released the first ver\", \"sion of C# and the CLR in 2002, and new versions came\\nroughly three years apart after that: C# 2.0 i\", \"n 2005, and C# 3.0 in 2008. Each was contained in a\\nproduct release of Visual Studio, such that C# 2\", \".0 and version 2.0 of the CLR runtime was released\\nwith Visual Studio 2005, and C# 3.0 and CLR 3.5 c\", \"ame with Visual Studio 2008. Microsoft then shifted\\nto a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio \", \"2010, Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, and most\\nrecently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the ve\", \"rsions of C# and the CLR started falling out of lockstep\\nwith Visual Studio, deliberately, for a cou\", \"ple of reasons.\\n\\n\\nThe first was that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, \", \"and was starting to\\nunbundle its various parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independe\", \"nt, parts. F#, which\\nfirst shipped \\u201cout of the box\\u201d in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to\", \" start down the opensource path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project\", \", it had never really\\nembraced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place\", \". Microsoft started\\nworking shortly thereafter on an open-source rewrite of its entire compiler tool\", \"chain, code-named\\n\\u201cRoslyn.\\u201d By the time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem were\", \" starting to ship\\nindependently, with Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for developer\", \"s to gather the parts\\nof the ecosystem they desired more easily. Open-source package management (cal\", \"led NuGet), which\\nbegan life well outside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated into V\", \"isual Studio so that\\nNuGet came \\u201cout of the box,\\u201d much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java IDEs.\", \"\\n\\n\\nMono, meanwhile, had started to gain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular, th\", \"e\\ngaming toolkit Unity had expressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running\\ninsid\", \"e the Unity toolkit. Unity-based games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the\\nJav\", \"aScript-on-.NET implementation that Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a Pythoninspired .\", \"NET language called Boo. Additionally, the open-source community produced another .NET\\nimplementatio\", \"n, the .NET Micro Framework, specifically aimed at embedded software systems and\\nsmall-scale hardwar\", \"e such as the Arduino platform.\\n\\n\\nAll of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, Micr\", \"osoft announced that the source\\nfor ASP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to anyo\", \"ne who wanted to look at it. It\\nwasn\\u2019t full open-source yet, though, in that they weren\\u2019t accepting \", \"pull requests. It was, however,\\nan important step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It an\", \"nounced that it would completely\\nopen-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making it a\", \"vailable to any platform and accept\\npull requests from any developer so inclined.
