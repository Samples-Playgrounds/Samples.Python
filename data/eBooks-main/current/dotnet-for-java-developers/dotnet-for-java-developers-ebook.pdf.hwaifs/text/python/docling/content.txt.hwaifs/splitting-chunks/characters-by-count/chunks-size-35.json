It was our first trip out of the country, and aside f\", \"rom the ridiculously long flight-eight hours on an airplane feels like forever to somebody who hasn'\", \"t yet finished their first decade of life-I really had no idea of what to expect. In fact, in an amu\", \"sing anecdote my father has yet to tire of telling, I remember having to sit down with my parents in\", \" front of a globe so that they could explain to me that 'the United States' was not, in fact, synony\", \"mous with 'the world.'\\n\\nIt was entirely a trip of firsts: my first experience wandering around in a \", \"world where I couldn't understand any of the written signs, my first experience eating food I couldn\", \"'t recognize, and my first experience feeling completely lost in the world around me. I found, to my\", \" eight-year-old horror, that I couldn't even figure out which bathroom to use-which, considering I h\", \"ad just the year before managed to convince my mother I didn't need to be escorted to the bathroom a\", \"nd back, was of particular concern. I didn't want her to start thinking I actually needed adult supe\", \"rvision. This was clearly not my home, and I was more than a little terrified of it.\\n\\nVisiting a for\", \"eign land, particularly to someone who has cocooned themselves entirely in the concepts and cultures\", \" of 'home,' can be intimidating and overwhelming without a guide. On that trip to France I had my pa\", \"rents, and despite neither of them speaking anything close to fluent French, they managed to guide u\", \"s through the tricky parts. (French-English guidebooks are a wonderful thing.)\\n\\nFor the typical Java\", \" developer, finding a guide to exploring the .NET ecosystem can be tricky, since the average Java de\", \"veloper can still hearken back to a time when expressing an interest in looking at .NET was tantamou\", \"nt to declaring a desire to betray everything good and right in the world (or so it seemed, at least\", \" at the time).\\n\\nIn this paper, I will serve as your guide to the .NET world. I've been a part of the\", \" .NET ecosystem almost as long as I've been a part of Java's. I started with Java in 1996; I started\", \" with what would become .NET in 2000, even before it was announced. I've built applications in both,\", \" written books for both, and explored the source for both. They're closer to one another than you mi\", \"ght think, but each has been fundamentally influenced by the people using them. In fact, it's not a \", \"bad analogy to think of them as twin brothers, separated at birth, raised by different sets of paren\", \"ts. Same DNA, but shaped by their experiences and events to be different in a number of interesting \", \"places.\\n\\nIf you're a Java developer, looking to get started exploring the .NET ecosystem, then suspe\", \"nd what you think you know, take my hand, and let's take a trip to a foreign land. Doing so will req\", \"uire a little history to understand how things came to be, then a quick set of instructions on how t\", \"o get the tooling set up (and which tooling you want, depending on your preferences). Once the envir\", \"onment is set up, we can pick up the critical differences between C# and Java, and start diving into\", \" some of the central frameworks in this world-ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and a few others. When we\\n\\n\", \"finish up, if you're following along, you'll have everything you need to start your own exploration \", \"of the .NET community, and from there you'll get to draw your own conclusions and make your own opin\", \"ions.\\n\\nMost importantly, you'll know how to order off the menu and tell the bathrooms apart.\\n\\nReady?\", \"\\n\\nIf you'd like to skip the walk down memory lane, you can jump to the next section, Getting Started\", \".\\n\\nOstensibly, the history of .NET begins in October of 2000, at Microsoft's Professional Developer \", \"Conference (PDC), when Microsoft announced to the world that they were working on a new programming \", \"platform, on which would rest the fate of all Microsoft development to follow. It was called .NET, i\", \"t would be the backbone for their upcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would be a part of t\", \"heir data management system (nicknamed 'SQLServer.NET'), and it would form the core development plat\", \"form for building interconnected applications into the future by leveraging emerging standards such \", \"as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few others the world had not yet really come to understand. It would be th\", \"e principal competitor platform to their principal development rival at the time, Sun Microsystems, \", \"and its Java platform. And the world could see that the shot was fired, the line in the sand drawn, \", \"and the armies drawn up; clearly, this was Microsoft copying the efforts of its competitors, seeking\", \" dominance, and\\u2026.\\n\\nAnd most of the world completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it h\", \"ad come to exist, and what Microsoft really sought to obtain from it.\\n\\nIn fact, it's fair to suggest\", \" that many within the Microsoft ecosystem misunderstood what .NET was really about; once announced, \", \"the marketing machine took over. Much effort was wasted due to the entanglement of '.NET' with 'web \", \"services,' and it would take the better part of a decade before people could understand that the two\", \" really had nothing intrinsically to do with one another any more than 'Perl' did with 'databases.' \", \"Microsoft management compounded all this confusion by re-branding the '.NET' suffix to a number of t\", \"heir products, which they later corrected but well after the damage had been done.\\n\\nBut despite all \", \"that, solid engineering rests at the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made it harder to\", \" see, but it's always been there. To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its proper\", \" historical context: that, in truth, it was the simple 'next step' along an evolutionary chain that \", \"stretched back much further than that October keynote almost two decades ago.\\n\\n## Of components, man\", \"aged environments, and code\\n\\nIn the beginning, there was C.\\n\\nTo be more accurate about it, in the be\", \"ginning a number of programming languages were created to make it easier to produce programs that kn\", \"ew how to execute on a single chip. They integrated directly with the hardware, making use of the fa\", \"cilities there to obtain memory, interact with the disk, and present data to the display for the use\", \"r to understand. In time, we as an industry found that this direct-hardware interaction had its draw\", \"backs, and we sought to create a series of abstractions on top of that hardware, to help coordinate \", \"the use of the hardware across multiple simultaneously\\n\\nexecuting programs. We called that first att\", \"empt at regulating and managing the hardware an operating system. And it was pretty good. So good, i\", \"n fact, that numerous flavors of operating system were born, including Microsoft's Windows operating\", \" system, and Solaris, and macOS (though it was called 'System 7' back then), and Linux, and a few ot\", \"hers whose names exist now only in the history books and dusty corners of Usenet forums. (Bonus poin\", \"ts if you recognize these names: Minix, Mach, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even more bonus points if y\", \"ou ever ran one of them. If you ever ran DOS, though, it just means you're old.)\\n\\nThe bigger, more i\", \"mportant issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system itself-that program\", \"mers found it helpful and useful to have 'something else' working with their programs. That 'somethi\", \"ng else' would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs executed and behaved, rather t\", \"han assuming that every single nuance had to be the programmers' responsibility.\\n\\nThis concept, in l\", \"arge, is essentially that of a 'managed environment.' Although it has its roots in operating systems\", \", it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of containers and cloud: tha\", \"t there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are responsible for details t\", \"hat the programmer doesn't want to have to deal with. Operating systems are managed environments in \", \"that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to schedule the execution of thre\", \"ads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network ports or data files. Virtual ma\", \"chines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in that they regulate the access an\", \"d reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode format into CPU-native instructions\", \", and prevent the direct access of memory (except under very specific circumstances) in order to avo\", \"id process termination by careless programming. Containers such as Docker are managed environments i\", \"n that they provide a context around an executable to mimic a precise environment-configuration file\", \"s, environment variables, and shared network settings-so that developers can be assured that the env\", \"ironment outside their programs are consistent regardless of where they are deployed.\\n\\nBy the early \", \"'90s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for Windows developers to \", \"be able to take 'the next step forward' in development evolution. The 'GUI revolution' of the mid-'8\", \"0s was largely finished; programs weren't just about 'dialogs and data,' but now needed to integrate\", \" more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for example) and start taking adva\", \"ntage of networking in greater detail. (Old developers like me will remember that it was around 1995\", \" that references to HTTP and 'the World Wide Web' were just starting to appear in publications and t\", \"echnology journals.)\\n\\nAs is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges emerged. C++\", \" developers had been speaking of 'reusable code' for several years, but it was Visual Basic (and Del\", \"phi, along with several other '4GL' variants) that demonstrated actual practical code reuse, in the \", \"form of 'controls': widgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly without requi\", \"ring in-depth knowledge about the controls' implementation. Simply obtain the library, put it into t\", \"he right place within the development environment, drag-and-drop the control into the construction a\", \"rea, and lo, the developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of 'application fr\", \"ameworks,' like MFC and OWL, but 'GUI builders' had demonstrated that the concept of 'controls' coul\", \"d be leveraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and events; now\", \"\\n\\nMicrosoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the bigger world beyond GUI development.\", \" More importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship-make it possible for outside develop\", \"ers to build 'things' that could be used by existing things (such as the operating system or, perhap\", \"s, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their implementation.\\n\\nTo do that, they needed to \", \"create a managed environment that would work across a variety of different languages, but all operat\", \"ing under the same rules. That effort, called the Component Object Model (COM), was the first of sev\", \"eral 'managed platforms' that emerged during the earlyand mid-'90s. (Ironically, several open-source\", \" efforts would go after this same space many years after Microsoft declared COM 'finished,' includin\", \"g Mozilla's XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in that it became the backbone of Windows development \", \"for a significant percentage of the Windows platform. But it still failed in that it left programs v\", \"ulnerable to many of the same things that had plagued them before: memory leaks, mishandled pointers\", \", and unexpected process termination at the first mistake. It was clear that, despite the managed pl\", \"atform, writing code in a 'native' language (such as C/C++ or Delphi) still wasn't a particularly gr\", \"eat place to be.\\n\\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that Sun Microsystems demonstrated the Ho\", \"tJava browser to the world, the centerpiece of which was this language that could be used to write e\", \"xecutable bits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft had come to the realization that this w\", \"as what it was missing: a 'managed language' to run on top of their managed platform. A managed lang\", \"uage had exactly the right 'distance' from the underlying operating system they were seeking-garbage\", \" collection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashes, and the virtual machine could he\", \"lp enforce stronger security controls that the world had just started to realize they needed. It was\", \", in many ways, a perfect match. Microsoft invested resources into building their own JVM, extended \", \"their IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrated COM into the runtime.\\n\\nUnfortuna\", \"tely, in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own destruction.\\n\\n## Hello, .NET\\n\\nDivor\", \"ces are never a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one is always fraught with opinion, revi\", \"sionist history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997/1998, two facts were becoming clear\", \": one, Sun didn't care for Microsoft's work increasing interoperability between their JVM and native\", \" COM components in Windows 1 , and two, Microsoft and Java were going to part ways, one way or anoth\", \"er. (Who got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)\\n\\nEither certain groups within Microsoft cou\", \"ld see the writing on the wall or they had come to find issues (real or perceived) with the Java Vir\", \"tual Machine; either way, by 1998, a new effort came to life inside of Microsoft, designed to bring \", \"a new managed platform and managed language into the world. Originally intended as the successor to \", \"COM, it went through a variety of names, including\\n\\n1  For the curious, Microsoft offered additional\", \" platform-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with native COM components. The irony of this \", \"is deep, considering that Sun had actually allowed for COM-specific native interfaces in their JNI s\", \"pecification-the first three methods in the interface table for a JNIEnv ('JNI environment') object \", \"were specifically left 'reserved' for the necessary three methods (AddRef, Release, and QueryInterfa\", \"ce) of every COM interface object. Those three slots are still reserved to this day.\\n\\n'COM+,' the 'C\", \"omponent Object Runtime' (COR), the 'Universal RunTime' (URT), and 'NextGeneration Windows Services'\", \" (NGWS) before finally being introduced to the world as '.NET' at that October 2000 PDC. Along with \", \"it would come a new language, code-named 'COOL' (supposedly to stand for the 'Component-Oriented Obj\", \"ect Language,' although opinions vary now) and later renamed 'C#.'\\n\\nWhile most observers considered \", \"C# and the CLR (the Common Language Runtime, the virtual machine executing the bytecode) to be direc\", \"t competitors of Java, Microsoft took careful steps to ensure that it was 'open' in ways that Java w\", \"as not: where the JVM was designed from the beginning to be a virtual machine for a single language,\", \" the CLR embraced a more polyglot approach, with Microsoft even going so far as to recruit several u\", \"niversities and companies to create new languages for this platform and/or adapt existing ones. This\", \" project, nicknamed 'Project 7' (for the 7 groups that participated), debuted several of these langu\", \"ages during .NET's introduction, and included CLR flavors of Eiffel, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of\", \" these languages gained any traction after the first few years of existence, and most no longer exis\", \"t, but their presence had the effect on Microsoft of 'keeping them honest' with respect to other lan\", \"guages beyond C# and Visual Basic as the platform grew and evolved. (Microsoft itself would later go\", \" on to introduce a number of new CLR-based languages, including a compiled-to-binary version of ECMA\", \"Script, two different efforts at bringing managed coding to C++, a hybrid object/functional language\", \" called F#, and several more research languages.)\\n\\nHowever, Microsoft also sought to make sure that \", \".NET was not a proprietary effort by investing thousands of man-hours into the creation of a series \", \"of international specifications-through the European Computer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA 2 )-t\", \"o ensure that C# and the underlying platform were both open industry standards. C# was accepted and \", \"ratified as ECMA-334, and the underlying runtime was given the name the 'Common Language Infrastruct\", \"ure' (CLI), and accepted and ratified as ECMA-335. Intel, HP, and several other industry participant\", \"s joined Microsoft in keeping these specifications up to date with changes to the language and the p\", \"latform, the most recent updates 3  coming in 2012 for the CLI and 2017 for C#.\\n\\nWith the introducti\", \"on of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpected side-effect: members of the open-source commun\", \"ity began to examine building a 'clean-room' implementation of them. While the CLI Specification did\", \"n't include any of the Windows-specific features (such as a deep COM integration) Microsoft wanted f\", \"or backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution for their existing developer base, the CLI Specifi\", \"cation itself provided enough integration points to make it interesting to implement on other platfo\", \"rms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one such project, calling it Mono.\\n\\nThe specification als\", \"o gave Microsoft some room to do what some within the company had been looking to do for quite a whi\", \"le: provide a research and experimentation vehicle for the academic and research communities to expl\", \"ore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripped-down version of the CLR source code, code-named 'Rotor,'\", \" distributed under an open-source license they created, called the\\n\\n2  ECMA, it should be noted, als\", \"o owns the specification for the language commonly known as 'JavaScript,' but is more rightly called\", \" 'ECMAScript,' governed as ECMA-262.\\n\\n3  CLI: https://www.iso.org/standard/58046.html and http://www\", \".ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ Ecma-335.htm; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/\", \"publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm\\n\\n'Shared Source' license, giving it the formal name 'Shared Sour\", \"ce CLI' or 'SSCLI.' While Mono would remain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many y\", \"ears, and Rotor of even less interest to those outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-sourc\", \"e mindset were sown. Over time, Mono would be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own compan\", \"y, Xamarin, which would faithfully parallel the work described by the specifications and periodicall\", \"y try out new ideas for the opensource community to consider.\\n\\nMicrosoft officially released the fir\", \"st version of C# and the CLR in 2002, and new versions came roughly three years apart after that: C#\", \" 2.0 in 2005, and C# 3.0 in 2008. Each was contained in a product release of Visual Studio, such tha\", \"t C# 2.0 and version 2.0 of the CLR runtime was released with Visual Studio 2005, and C# 3.0 and CLR\", \" 3.5 came with Visual Studio 2008. Microsoft then shifted to a two-year release cycle, with Visual S\", \"tudio 2010, Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, and most recently, Visual Studio 2017. However, \", \"the versions of C# and the CLR started falling out of lockstep with Visual Studio, deliberately, for\", \" a couple of reasons.\\n\\nThe first was that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to sp\", \"eak, and was starting to unbundle its various parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and inde\", \"pendent, parts. F#, which first shipped 'out of the box' in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of the\", \"se to start down the opensource path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research pr\", \"oject, it had never really embraced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first \", \"place. Microsoft started working shortly thereafter on an open-source rewrite of its entire compiler\", \" toolchain, code-named 'Roslyn.' By the time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem\", \" were starting to ship independently, with Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for deve\", \"lopers to gather the parts of the ecosystem they desired more easily. Open-source package management\", \" (called NuGet), which began life well outside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated i\", \"nto Visual Studio so that NuGet came 'out of the box,' much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java \", \"IDEs.\\n\\nMono, meanwhile, had started to gain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular\", \", the gaming toolkit Unity had expressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running i\", \"nside the Unity toolkit. Unity-based games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the\", \" JavaScript-on-.NET implementation that Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a Pythoninspir\", \"ed .NET language called Boo. Additionally, the open-source community produced another .NET implement\", \"ation, the .NET Micro Framework, specifically aimed at embedded software systems and small-scale har\", \"dware such as the Arduino platform.\\n\\nAll of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, M\", \"icrosoft announced that the source for ASP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to a\", \"nyone who wanted to look at it. It wasn't full open-source yet, though, in that they weren't accepti\", \"ng pull requests. It was, however, an important step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It\", \" announced that it would completely open-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making i\", \"t available to any platform and accept pull requests from any developer so inclined. A new .NET impl\", \"ementation would be completely open-source and hosted on GitHub, called .NET Core. It also announced\", \" the creation of the .NET Foundation, an industry consortium of groups dedicated to the growth of th\", \"e .NET platform, in\\n\\nmuch the same fashion that the Java Community Process governs the continued gro\", \"wth of the Java platform 4 .\\n\\nTo be sure, Microsoft made some missteps along the way, and definitely\", \" learned a few hard lessons about its relationship with the open-source community, but by late 2017,\", \" Microsoft was statistically the biggest contributor on GitHub (measured in terms of total numbers o\", \"f contributors 5 ), and all of its key components-language, runtime, libraries, and many of its tool\", \"s-were available for download on GitHub.\\n\\nMicrosoft also started to get more serious about the cross\", \"-platform/portability aspects of the .NET ecosystem. Xamarin, which by 2009 had started producing to\", \"ols that could cross-compile .NET bytecode into native applications for iOS and Android platforms (t\", \"he catchy-named 'MonoDroid' and less-catchy 'Mono for iOS' toolkits), was flourishing, and Microsoft\", \" realized that a practical story for being able to share non-UI portions of code across multiple pla\", \"tforms was necessary if they wanted to avoid developer confusion.\\n\\nWhile the ECMA Specifications had\", \" discussed different 'profiles' for levels of .NET standardization, these profiles were in many ways\", \" similar to their 'Java Standard Edition,' 'Java Micro Edition,' and 'Java Enterprise Edition' cousi\", \"ns-a little unwieldy in a number of ways, but most notably in that there wasn't really a good way to\", \" guarantee compatibility across platforms and implementation versions-if code is compiled by the Jav\", \"a6 compiler, it is safe to assume that it will continue to run on the Java6 virtual machine from whe\", \"nce it was compiled, but the Java APIs do change from release to release, and this has tripped up th\", \"e unwary Java developer from time to time.\\n\\nThus, in 2016, Microsoft announced the '.NET Standard 1.\", \"0' profile, a collection not of relatively vague implementation documents, but an actual API standar\", \"d, such that a developer who sought to build a library that could be used by a variety of different \", \"platforms (across a certain number of versions of that platform, even) could know that anything that\", \" implemented .NET Standard 1.0 would be able to consume that library, regardless of where that code \", \"is running-on a web server, on a mobile device, or even on somebody's VR helmet (running a 3D intera\", \"ctive application written with Unity).\\n\\nWhich brings us, now, to the current day.\\n\\n4  Ironically, Mi\", \"crosoft's move to the .NET Foundation comes at the same time Oracle is looking to move away from the\", \" JCP; both companies have experience with standards organizations, and neither wants to see innovati\", \"on stifled in committee.\\n\\n5  http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-open-source-2016-9\\n\\n## \", \"Hello, strange new world\\n\\nTo the Java developer, this is a strange, strange world compared to the on\", \"e they glimpsed into back in 2000.\\n\\nFor starters, the Java world looks wildly different than it once\", \" did.

Windows Server can be loaded into a Docker container, and Microsoft works with the D\", \"ocker community to bring Docker-on-Windows up to the same level of sublime that it has on other plat\", \"forms.\\n\\nWithin the .NET ecosystem, the .NET Standard, now at a 2.0 release, provides an umbrella of \", \"guaranteed compatibility across three major platforms of this writing: the Windows-based .NET Framew\", \"ork (which contains the necessary libraries for building Windows client applications, for example), \", \".NET Core (intended for the cross-platform server world, including Docker containers and cloud-nativ\", \"e targets), and Xamarin (principally aimed at the iOS and Android world, but also providing bindings\", \" for building macOS applications). Unity has joined the .NET Foundation and expects to be aligned wi\", \"th the various versions of .NET Standard by mid-2018.\\n\\nAll of which means that it's not a bad time t\", \"o start exploring this world in more depth.\\n\\n## Getting Started: Tooling\\n\\nGetting started with .NET \", \"depends pretty heavily on your choice of operating system and, to a lesser degree, the development e\", \"xperience you want. As mentioned earlier, Visual Studio supports both Windows and macOS, as well as \", \"a variety of Linux distributions, which pretty much covers everybody. In this section, the goal is t\", \"o get tools installed, a basic introduction to the major project artifacts, and, of course, build th\", \"e traditional 'HelloWorld.' Once we've done that, we'll talk a little bit about what we're producing\", \", and the package system for .NET (called NuGet).\\n\\n## Hello, web?\\n\\nIf you're just looking to flirt a\", \" little with the C# language but don't want to commit any disk space to the idea, one of the easiest\", \" ways to explore the language is the online interactive browser-based tutorial found at https://aka.\", \"ms/csharpquickstarts.\\n\\nHowever, doing so will run into a whole slew of limitations to your explorati\", \"on, so sooner or later you're probably going to want to commit some disk space.\\n\\n## Docker all the t\", \"hings!\\n\\nIf you're a Docker enthusiast, and you want to get the quickest path possible to working wit\", \"h .NET, fire up a Microsoft-maintained .NET Core Docker container by running:\\n\\ndocker run -it micros\", \"oft/dotnet bash\\n\\nThis will pull the latest version of Microsoft's Docker Hub-stored Docker images, a\", \"nd drop you into a shell prompt from which you can run the 'dotnet' CLI tool. When you are ready to \", \"edit some files, run the Docker image with a volume mount to a host's local directory, and use your \", \"favorite editormight we suggest Visual Studio Code?-to edit the .NET Core-generated files we're abou\", \"t to create.\\n\\n## Linux .NET?\\n\\nAs with most things Linux, installation instructions depend on which f\", \"lavor of Linux you're running.\\n\\nRed Hat is the easiest install, since Microsoft and Red Hat have par\", \"tnered on a few things in the past, so the .NET Core packages are in the Red Hat distribution channe\", \"ls; assuming you are using the Red Hat Subscription Manager, two commands get .NET Core on your mach\", \"ine:\\n\\nyum install rh-dotnet20 -y scl enable rh-dotnet20 bash\\n\\nAt that point, the 'dotnet' tool shoul\", \"d be in your PATH and good to go.\\n\\nIf you're on Ubuntu, there's a bit more work required. While Micr\", \"osoft is working to get the .NET Core packages into the standard Ubuntu distribution channels, at th\", \"e time of this writing that hasn't happened completely, so Ubuntu users will need to add Microsoft's\", \" key and Ubuntu-release-specific URL into the list of sources the Ubuntu apt-get utilities check for\", \" packages. Full details are on the .NET Core website at www.dot.net/core; once that's done, however,\", \" apt-get can install the 'dotnetsdk-2.1.101' package onto the system, and this will get the 'dotnet'\", \" tool in the PATH and good to go.\\n\\nThis 'register the channel' followed by 'use the standard package\", \" manager' is actually the same story for Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, and Debian; again, full step-by-s\", \"tep instructions are on the .NET Core 'Getting Started' page (https://aka.ms/dotnet-getstarted-linux\", \"), which has a drop-down to choose between the six flavors of Linux that .NET Core supports. Add the\", \" Microsoft feed to the package manager, use the package manager to do the install, and the 'dotnet' \", \"tool should be available on the PATH.\\n\\nOnce that's done, .NET Core is ready to go.\\n\\n## Visual Studio\", \" Code\\n\\nFor almost any operating system you might find yourself using, including most of the popular \", \"distributions of Linux, Microsoft has a lightweight editor called Visual Studio Code. If you've been\", \" doing a lot of web front-end work, you may already have been using it. In many ways, it's the lates\", \"t attempt at building an 'editor-plus-plug-ins' tool, and it is gaining some traction with the world\", \" outside the Microsoft ecosystem. (It's actually the preferred tool for working with Google's openso\", \"urce Angular project, among other things.)

The 'dotnet' tool hides a \", \"fair amount of .NET Core's machinery, in the same way that Maven hides a fair amount of the Java mac\", \"hinery (CLASSPATH references, for example), so keep in mind that we're only looking at the tip of th\", \"e iceberg as we work with this. (Make no mistake-the tooling here goes just as deep and just as wide\", \" as anything we've ever used in the Java world, and it's just as easy to get lost in it if we dive t\", \"oo deeply into it too quickly.)\\n\\nTo start a .NET Core application, we can use 'dotnet' to generate a\", \" project based on the 'console' application template, like so:\\n\\n## $ dotnet new console -o HelloWorl\", \"d\\n\\nThis will generate a 'console' project into the directory 'HelloWorld'; for those who are curious\", \", 'dotnet new' by itself, or 'dotnet new --list,' will list all of the project templates that the 'd\", \"otnet' command knows about. Out of the box, it has about a dozen or so project templates, including \", \"console applications, class libraries, a half-dozen flavors of web projects, and so on.

This requests all\", \" of the dependent assemblies-JAR file equivalents, essentially-from a Maven-like, cloud-based servic\", \"e called NuGet. NuGet was heavily inspired by Maven and Ruby gems, which means, for the most part, i\", \"t works the same way Maven does-when doing a 'dotnet restore,' the machine must be connected to the \", \"Internet, and depending on the size of the project, could take a while to download all the dependenc\", \"ies.\\n\\nOnce the project has been 'restore'd, all of the dependencies are downloaded, and the applicat\", \"ion can be run by using 'dotnet run' from within the project directory.

In fact, we can do it in one se\", \"ntence: C# is an object-oriented language that borrows heavily from its lexical ancestors, C++ and J\", \"ava, and from other 'component'-oriented languages such as Delphi. In recent years, C# (like most la\", \"nguages) has begun to incorporate more functional programming concepts into its syntax, and as a res\", \"ult presents a pretty multiparadigmatic set of capabilities.\\n\\nIn other words, take Java, throw in a \", \"number of the features Java developers have debated for a decade or more, then add a bunch of functi\", \"onal programming concepts, stir well, bake for 15 years, and serve. Microsoft's language designers h\", \"ave been much more aggressive than Sun's when it comes to introducing new features into their respec\", \"tive languages, so for the most part a Java developer's experience with C# will probably be characte\", \"rized by 'Oh, sure, that all looks pretty similar-wait, what is THAT?'\\n\\nBy the way, C# currently sit\", \"s at version 7.2 at the time of this writing, and Microsoft's language designers have been just as a\", \"ggressive in the latest revisions of the language as they were in the early ones. This is a language\", \" under constant evolution, for good or for ill. So there's much to discuss, and we will not be able \", \"to cover the entire surface area of the language-the focus here will be only on those parts that wil\", \"l be unintuitive to the Java developer looking at 'average' C# code.\\n\\n## C# Basics\\n\\nTo begin, let's \", \"take a look at what was generated as part of those 'HelloWorld' console applications, since that's p\", \"robably the easiest way to get started.\\n\\n```\\nusing System; namespace HelloDotNet { class Program { s\", \"tatic void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\\\"Hello World!\\\"); } } }\\n```\\n\\nIt's pretty easy to s\", \"pot a number of things right off the bat: C# is a C-family language, using curlybrackets to denote s\", \"cope blocks and semicolons to terminate statements. Code is organized into\\n\\nnamespaces using the 'na\", \"mespace' keyword, and pretty clearly we have classes just as Java does. The Console class (part of t\", \"he 'System' namespace) represents the command-line input/output facilities, and WriteLine is obvious\", \"ly a synonym for 'println.' Square brackets are used to denote an array in the same way they do in J\", \"ava, and arrays in C# work almost exactly the same way as they do in Java, save that they have been \", \"slightly more 'formalized' in that there is a full-blown class, System. Array, that defines a number\", \" of methods and properties that all arrays will share. Core 'primitive' types are actually defined a\", \"s full-blown classes, so that System.Array is the 'class' representing each array instance, System.S\", \"tring is the 'string' primitive type, System.Int32 is the 'int' primitive type, and so on. All types\", \", whether 'primitive' (what .NET calls 'value types') or 'class,' all inherit from the base System.O\", \"bject type, with value types being 'boxed' to objects when necessary. (This was the inspiration for \", \"autoboxing rules in Java5, in fact.) As a result, 'System.String s' and 'string s' are actually enti\", \"rely equivalent declarations. New value types can be defined, but it's pretty rare.\\n\\nLet's start wit\", \"h some of the more straightforward parts of the language.\\n\\n## Starting exploration: classes, propert\", \"ies, and methods\\n\\nC# 1.0 was, in large measure, a near-direct clone of Java, with some keyword chang\", \"es and some new features that Java has debated for years: explicit properties and delegates (an earl\", \"y form of lambda expressions). Thus, we can write the traditional 'Person' type in C# like so:\\n\\n```\\n\", \"class Person { public string FirstName { get { return this.firstName; } set { this.firstName = value\", \"; } } private string firstName; public string LastName { get { return this.lastName; } set { this.la\", \"stName = value; } } private string lastName; public int Age { get { return this.age; } set { this.ag\", \"e = value; }\\n```\\n\\n```\\n} private int age; public Person(string fn, string ln, int a) { this.FirstName\", \" = fn; this.LastName = ln; this.Age = a; } }\\n```\\n\\nProperties can be read-only by eliminating the 'se\", \"t' clause, and write-only (if that makes sense, which it rarely does) by eliminating the 'get' claus\", \"e. The implicit parameter to a 'set' clause is always called 'value,' and there are no restrictions \", \"to what a property-get or property-set clause can do within its body, although 95% of the time they \", \"simply read and write a field within the class.\\n\\nSo far, if anything, it seems more verbose than Jav\", \"a. However, that was the C# language as of 15 years ago-they've made a few changes along the way.\\n\\nO\", \"ne very common change is to the requirement to actually provide a body to the property-get and prope\", \"rty-set clauses; as is the case in Java, 95% of the time these clauses simply wrap around a field an\", \"d provide encapsulated access and nothing else. Which means, frankly, that the time spent writing th\", \"e implementation for these is pretty much a waste of time (and something that IDEA or other IDEs can\", \" generate for us). The C# language designers agreed, and in C# 3.0 added the concept of 'autoimpleme\", \"nted properties,' which asks the C# compiler to not only generate the property method implementation\", \"s, but also synthesize the field used for the backing store. This simplifies the Person class down t\", \"o:\\n\\n```\\nclass Person { public string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } pu\", \"blic int Age { get; set; } public Person(string fn, string ln, int a) { this.FirstName = fn; this.La\", \"stName = ln; this.Age = a; } }\\n```\\n\\nThat's\\u2026awfully terse. But what about those scenarios where we wa\", \"nt to have the property available to be read by anyone (public access), but only accessible for muta\", \"tion from within the class (private access)? The get and set clauses can have different levels of ac\", \"cess, the most common idiom being:\\n\\n```\\nclass Person { public string FirstName { get; private set; }\", \" public string LastName { get; private set; } public int Age { get; private set; } public Person(str\", \"ing fn, string ln, int a) { this.FirstName = fn; this.LastName = ln; this.Age = a; } }\\n```\\n\\nThis wil\", \"l effectively make the fields immutable from the outside yet still something we can change from the \", \"interior of the class. The field itself is synthesized by the compiler (usually with a straightforwa\", \"rd name such as '__$&lt;Person&gt;$&lt;FirstName&gt;@5417,' or something equally nonobvious), and wo\", \"n't be directly accessible by code. (Granted, one can always use System.Reflectionthe .NET direct eq\", \"uivalent to Java's java.lang.reflect package-to access the field at runtime, but that's an awful lot\", \" of work to work around something that can be discarded at any time.) For those rare situations wher\", \"e the auto-generated properties don't do the right thing, C# developers can always 'drop back' to wr\", \"iting the property clauses out longhand and wrapping a declared field.\\n\\nMethods, meanwhile, work pre\", \"tty much the same way they do in Java, in terms of their declaration and syntax. Methods can be inst\", \"ance methods or static (although static method invocations must always go through the class name, wh\", \"ereas Java will allow calling a static method through an instance variable-seriously, try it, it's w\", \"eird), and parameters are declared in order with a type and a name:\\n\\n```\\npublic class Person { publi\", \"c string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } public int Age { get; set; } p\", \"ublic Person(string fn, string ln, int a) {\\n```\\n\\n```\\nthis.FirstName = fn; this.LastName = ln; this.A\", \"ge = a; } public void SayHello(string recipient) { Console.WriteLine(\\\"Hello, {0}, I, {1}, say hello.\", \"\\\", recipient, FirstName); } } class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Person p = new Perso\", \"n(\\\"Ted\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 46); p.SayHello(\\\"Fred\\\"); } }\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, C# follows pretty much exactly \", \"the same rules that Java does for method declaration and invocation. But, again, C# allows for some \", \"interesting variations on this theme.\\n\\nFor starters, C# has had the concept of 'method literals' sin\", \"ce 1.0, though the syntax has changed over each successive revision of the language. The first step \", \"was 'delegates,' essentially the ability to declare a method signature and then assign methods-on-ob\", \"ject-instances to a given delegate instance, like so:\\n\\n```\\nclass Person { // . . . public delegate v\", \"oid HelloProc(string recipient); public HelloProc IndirectSayHello; } class Program { static void Ma\", \"in(string[] args) { Person p = new Person(\\\"Ted\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 46); p.SayHello(\\\"Fred\\\"); p.IndirectSayHel\", \"lo = p.SayHello; p.IndirectSayHello(\\\"Fred\\\"); } }\\n```\\n\\nThis was a pretty verbose way of doing method-\", \"reference-capture, and with successive versions of C#, they simplified it, particularly once the .NE\", \"T platform introduced generics. (Yes, C# has generics, yes they look syntactically almost identical \", \"to Java generics, but no, they don't work the same way when compiled-where Java uses 'type erasure,'\", \" C# uses 'reified generics' and persists the generic definition all the way into the compiled byteco\", \"de.) The 'delegate' keyword here introduces a new type-a function pointer, if you will-and we can de\", \"clare an instance of the delegate on the Person class, assign a method to it, and invoke the assigne\", \"d method through that delegate.\\n\\n## Lambdas, type inference, and extension classes\\n\\nBy the time C# 3\", \".0 came around, however, C# supported full-bore lambda syntax, complete with method parameter type i\", \"nference, so that we could write method literals in-line:\\n\\n```\\np.IndirectSayHello = (recipient) => {\", \" Console.WriteLine(\\\"Hey, {0}. Whatever.\\\", recipient); }; p.IndirectSayHello(\\\"Shaggy\\\");\\n```\\n\\nLambdas \", \"turned out to be a major turning point within the C# language, along with several other features of \", \"the C# 3.0 release, including local variable type inference, which simply allows for the keyword 'va\", \"r' to appear in place of the type in a local variable declaration, like so:\\n\\n```\\nvar x = 12; var y =\", \" \\\"Fred\\\"; var z = p.IndirectSayHello; z(\\\"Wilma\\\");\\n```\\n\\nThe 'var' keyword does not, as some in the Jav\", \"a world theorized at its introduction, create an untyped variable; the C# compiler simply infers the\", \" variable's type from the right-hand-side expression, and assigns that to the variable type. Thus, t\", \"he 'x' variable is strongly typed as an integer (since that is an integer literally on the right-han\", \"d side), 'y' is a string, and 'z' is a delegate that accepts a method reference that takes a single \", \"string parameter and returns void. All the 'var' keyword does, simply, is allow the C# developer a b\", \"rief respite from having to type out type signatures in places where the compiler could figure it ou\", \"t on its own.\\n\\nOn top of this, Microsoft also introduced a fascinating feature called 'extension cla\", \"sses,' which has found its way into other languages such as Swift. In short, a class can write 'exte\", \"nsion methods' that can effectively 'inject' themselves as method declarations onto other classes, a\", \"dding new functionality to classes already compiled. (It's vaguely reminiscent of aspects as describ\", \"ed by AspectJ, but a strictly limited subset thereof.)\\n\\nFor example, assume that it's becoming reall\", \"y common to want to count the number of words in a given String. In the earliest days of Java, it wa\", \"s assumed that we could extend the String class to add that kind of functionality, but Sun very quic\", \"kly clamped down on that, made String final, and\\n\\nearned the (short-lived) wrath of Java developers \", \"everywhere. Java developers were forced to write 'StringUtils' classes that had static methods on th\", \"em to count the words in a string, similar to this C# equivalent:\\n\\n```\\npublic class StringUtils { pu\", \"blic static int WordCount(String str) { return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' }, StringSplitOp\", \"tions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length; } }\\n```\\n\\nFrankly, though, using this left a pretty bitter taste in\", \" everybody's mouth, since it smacked of doing procedural programming. Java developers just learned t\", \"o live with it; C# language designers said, 'We can go one step better.' If you agree that the class\", \" will never have any instance data and never be instantiated as an instance (declare the class 'stat\", \"ic'), then it can use the first parameter to declare a 'this' parameter, and essentially declare a m\", \"ethod that will appear on the targeted class, like so:\\n\\n```\\npublic static class MyStringExtensions {\", \" public static int WordCount(this String str) { return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' }, Strin\", \"gSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length; } }\\n```\\n\\n(Note that 'String' is shorthand for 'System.Stri\", \"ng,' which is a synonym for the earlier type 'string.' All of the 'primitive types' in C# are aliase\", \"s for the System-namespaced types, so 'int' is the same as 'System.Int32,' and so on. This has to do\", \" with how C# allows the declaration of 'value types,' and while a fascinating discussion in its own \", \"right, it's a little out-of-scope from what we're doing here.)\\n\\nThis extension class means that now \", \"we can write the following:\\n\\n```\\nvar words = \\\"One two three four\\\"; var wordCount = words.WordCount()\", \"; // 4\\n```\\n\\nExtension classes don't just magically apply everywhere, however-they must be brought in\", \"to scope via the use of the 'using' statements, so that if we don't care to use the MyStringExtensio\", \"ns, the WordCount() method won't appear on String types. And the original class remains unaffected, \", \"which means that the WordCount() extension (like all extensions) cannot have any impact on the inter\", \"nals of the extended class-in fact, it can't see any of the internal members, and so can only ever b\", \"e able to use the public interface of the extended class. It's purely compiler syntactic sugar.\\n\\n## \", \"Language-INtegrated Query (LINQ)\\n\\nAll of this led up to one of the signature moments for the C# comp\", \"iler with the 3.0 release: Language-INtegrated Query, or LINQ, for short. To many in the Java commun\", \"ity, LINQ represented everything that was wrong with Microsoft, accusing them of 'embedding SQL into\", \" the C# language' and turning C# into a 4GL that was proprietarily bound to SQL Server. As the Jedi \", \"Master put it, 'Amazing-every single part of that sentence is entirely incorrect.' LINQ wasn't integ\", \"rating SQL, it isn't about SQL Server, and it's actually built up around core language principles th\", \"at had nothing to do with relational databases, much less integrated with SQL Server.\\n\\nLet's start b\", \"y examining a simple collection of Person objects in a list:\\n\\n```\\nvar people = new List<Person>() { \", \"new Person(\\\"Ted\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 45), new Person(\\\"Charlotte\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 39), new Person(\\\"Michael\\\", \\\"Newar\", \"d\\\", 24), new Person(\\\"Matthew\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 18), new Person(\\\"Beth\\\", \\\"Massi\\\", 39), new Person(\\\"Dustin\\\", \", \"\\\"Campbell\\\", 43) };\\n```\\n\\nSuppose I want to give everybody within this list a beer. Sharp readers will\", \" notice, of course, that my youngest son is not yet eligible to receive a beer, and this is a family\", \"-friendly article, so we don't want to get into trouble with the local authorities.\\n\\nWere this a dis\", \"cussion of Java8 lambdas, we would talk about using lambdas and streams to filter the collection bef\", \"ore applying a higher-order function across each to give each individual a beer. (If that's new to y\", \"ou, Venkat Subramaniam has some great conference lectures online that describe Java8 lambdas in more\", \" detail.) As far back as C# 3.0, Microsoft saw the need, and chose not only to layer functional prin\", \"ciples into the language, but to put a syntax in place that would actually hide the fact that this w\", \"as ever functional programming in the first place:\\n\\n```\\nvar drinkers = from p in people where p.Age \", \"> 21 select p;\\n```\\n\\nThis is a LINQ query expression, and despite the fact that it looks similar to S\", \"QL, it's actually invoking several functional methods in sequence using a fluent interface; translat\", \"ed out of the SQL-like syntax, it looks more like:\\n\\n```\\ndrinkers = people.Where((p) => p.Age > 21);\\n\", \"```\\n\\nAll of the traditional functional operations are present here-map, filter, and the rest-but the\", \"y 'hide' behind this query expression syntax. We'll talk more about the interesting features and imp\", \"lications of LINQ when we get to Entity Framework in the last section, but for now, just think of\\n\\nL\", \"INQ as a syntax that is designed to deliberately bring some of the set-oriented nature of SQL and th\", \"e functional-oriented nature of languages such as Haskell into the C# language as a first-class citi\", \"zen.\\n\\n(For anybody who really wants to see LINQ taken to an absolute extreme, it can be instructiona\", \"l to look at Luke Hoban's 'single-LINQ-expression-ray-tracer' blog post from 10 years ago, available\", \" at https://aka.ms/linqraytracer. It will send chills down your back, one way or another.)\\n\\n## Async\", \"hronous programming with Async/Await\\n\\nC# 4.0 introduced a number of interesting features, but C# 5.0\", \" truly bucked the status quo by introducing language support for a form of asynchronous programming \", \"via the 'async' and 'await' keywords. While not a general-purpose, all-around concurrency feature, a\", \"sync/await added the ability to easily add 'little concurrency' into common programming tasks such a\", \"s issuing a request for a database query or executing a Web API request without having to manually m\", \"anage the threads necessary to do so without blocking. Leveraging some work done elsewhere on the .N\", \"ET platform (the Task Parallel Library, or TPL), C# essentially now allows developers to start some \", \"work and return a Task&lt;T&gt; object, which represents that additional work. At the source code le\", \"vel, 'async' can decorate either a method signature or an anonymous method literal to indicate it sh\", \"ould run asynchronously, and 'await' tells the compiler to generate the code necessary to hold thing\", \"s in place until the asynchronous code completes. (Essentially, these are language-level implementat\", \"ions of 'promises,' which are permeating the JavaScript world and slowly starting to gather steam in\", \" the Java world as well, under the name 'CompletableFuture' out of the java.util.concurrent package \", \"in Java8.)\\n\\n```\\nasync Task PlaySongsAsync(int[] ids) { foreach (var id in ids) { try { var data = aw\", \"ait service.GetEncodedDataAsync(id); var song = await Task.Run(() => Decode(data)); await PlayAsync(\", \"song); } catch (Exception e) { /* just skip the song */ } } }\\n```\\n\\nThere is much, much more we can d\", \"iscuss with respect to C#, but then we'd have no time to talk about anything else, and there is much\", \", much more to go over on our tour. Fortunately, Microsoft has a great collection of web resources o\", \"n the language, starting with a page that lists an overall history of the language, available at htt\", \"ps://aka.ms/csharpwhatsnew, and a general (if abbreviated) overview of the language available at htt\", \"ps://aka.ms/csharptour. And, of course, there're books. Lots and lots of books.\\n\\nBut once you know h\", \"ow to write code in this language, what can you do with it?\\n\\n## Frameworks, for the Win!\\n\\nBy far and\", \" away, the most popular thing to do with C# and the .NET runtime is to build a web application of so\", \"me form, just as it is with the Java language and runtime. To be sure, the .NET ecosystem supports m\", \"ore than this-one can build desktop applications, mobile applications, and even games (using the afo\", \"rementioned Unity framework, among others), but the lion's share of code written in C# is web applic\", \"ations.\\n\\nLike its twin, .NET offers a comprehensive framework of web functionality, ranging all the \", \"way from drag-and-drop-built user interface, to MVC-based server-side rendering, to the construction\", \" of HTTP-based APIs for invocation by single-page applications written in JavaScript or mobile appli\", \"cations. Somewhat confusingly, however, all three are referred to by the name 'ASP.NET.'\\n\\n(Note to t\", \"hose who recognize the 'ASP' moniker from the early days of the Sun/Microsoft rivalry: In the COM da\", \"ys, Microsoft's web technology was called 'Active Server Pages,' ASP for short, named after ActiveX,\", \" one of the marketing names for COM. When Microsoft started working on the CLR internally, one of it\", \"s most important consumers was the ASP team, who sought to create a system similar to JSP to replace\", \" ASP. Since the effort was to redo ASP in .NET, the name 'ASP.NET' was coined. However, aside from t\", \"he basic notion that 'this is for the web,' there's little to no relationship between ASP.NET and it\", \"s predecessor.)\\n\\nThe ASP.NET 'family' is fundamentally broken into three parts, two of which we'll e\", \"xamine here (in brief):\\n\\n- ASP.NET WebForms, the first flavor of ASP.NET, released with .NET 1.0, fe\", \"aturing drag-and-drop user interface construction. It was designed to try to bring a VisualBasic-sty\", \"le design philosophy to the web, but by .NET 3.0, the Microsoft community had come to understand the\", \" design advantages of an MVC-style design approach, and all work on WebForms essentially ceased. Iro\", \"nically, about the time that interest in WebForms was ending, the Java community was building up JSF\", \", the equivalent to WebForms in Java.\\n- ASP.NET MVC: Based on the classic 'Model-View-Controller' pr\", \"inciples that the Sun 'Model 2' design for servlets and JSP first laid out, Microsoft created ASP.NE\", \"T MVC, released the source code for it shortly after its initial release, and has considered this to\", \" be its first-class server-side web framework ever since. ASP.NET MVC was rebranded (and refactored)\", \" to be 'ASP.NET Core MVC' in 2015, in keeping with the '.NET Core' naming for the cross-platform run\", \"time, and has made some conceptual shifts as new frameworks-such as Ruby-on-Rails-gained popularity \", \"and created some new patterns (such as routing tables).\\n\\n- ASP.NET MVC Web API: While the name certa\", \"inly gets no points for brevity, it does accurately reflect the idea that this framework is built of\", \"f of the same concepts that underlie the ASP.NET MVC library, but with the intent of producing JSON \", \"data instead of HTML. When ASP.NET MVC was tagged with the 'Core' moniker, the 'MVC' was formally dr\", \"opped from Web API projects, so that now they are simply 'ASP.NET Core Web API,' or more informally,\", \" 'Web API' projects.\\n\\nLet's have a look at a quick ASP.NET Core Web API application-the ubiquitous T\", \"ODO list-and then we'll have a quick look at an MVC application before we look at Microsoft's data-s\", \"torage framework, Entity Framework.\\n\\n## ASP.NET Core Web API\\n\\nTo get started with Core Web API, we f\", \"irst need to scaffold out the Web API template; this can be done either via 'File|New' in one of the\", \" Visual Studio IDEs, or from the command-line using the .NET Core CLI tools by executing 'dotnet new\", \" webapi -o todoapi.' This will create a subdirectory called 'todoapi' and install the .NET Core Web \", \"API project inside of it. Out of the box, it scaffolds out a simple API that has one controller to h\", \"and back arbitrary 'value' objects, accessible at http://localhost:5000/api/values. Before we make a\", \"ny changes to the code, it's always good to make sure the scaffold is working, so execute a 'dotnet \", \"run' from within the 'todoapi' directory, and navigate to the given URL; the response should be a di\", \"rt-simple JSON array containing two strings.\\n\\nA Web API project, like its cousin the MVC application\", \", is broken into models and controllers, with the 'view' assumed to be an automated conversion from \", \"a model object into JSON. Thus, in a Web API project, the goal will be to accept incoming requests, \", \"perform the necessary business logic, and return the appropriate model type, usually corresponding t\", \"o the resource type in the URL, to be converted to JSON.\\n\\nThe Controllers directory contains the cod\", \"e for the ValuesController, which is the default-scaffolded code. It doesn't use any model objects, \", \"which means it's clearly inferior. Let's delete it, and replace it with something that's a little mo\", \"re 'MV'-like. That means, first of all, that we need a model object to represent a TODO item, which \", \"is a pretty simple domain object:\\n\\n```\\npublic class Todo { public long ID { get; set; } public strin\", \"g Description { get; set; } public bool Completed { get; set; } public Todo() { Completed = false; }\", \" }\\n```\\n\\n(Note that it would be a bit irregular to call this a POJO, since it's not a Java object, bu\", \"t that's basically exactly what this is. These are sometimes referred to as Plain Old C# Objects, PO\", \"COs, or, less often, Plain Old DotNet Objects or PODNOs. Definitely doesn't roll off the tongue like\", \" POJOs, but we do what we can.)\\n\\nHaving a domain object, it now remains to build a controller that w\", \"ill respond to the appropriate URL (which, by convention, will be prefixed by '/api,' but is of cour\", \"se configurable). The Web API expectation is that a controller will be a class that has a number of \", \"public methods that obey some conventions, in terms of both method names and parameter sets, like Ja\", \"va has done with later versions of the Servlet and EJB specifications.\\n\\n```\\n[Route(\\\"api/[controller]\", \"\\\")] public class TodosController : Controller { private List<Todo> todos = new List<Todo>() { new To\", \"do() { ID=0, Description=\\\"Get milk\\\", Completed=true }, new Todo() { ID=1, Description=\\\"Get pet food\\\"\", \" }, new Todo() { ID=2, Description=\\\"Learn .NET Core\\\" }, new Todo() { ID=3, Description=\\\"Write billio\", \"n-dollar app\\\" } }; // GET api/todos [HttpGet] public IEnumerable<Todo> Get() { return todos; } // GE\", \"T api/todos/5 [HttpGet(\\\"{id}\\\")] public Todo Get(int id) { return todos.First((t) => t.ID == id); } /\", \"/ POST api/todos [HttpPost] public void Post([FromBody]Todo value) { todos.Add(value); }\\n```\\n\\n```\\n//\", \" PUT api/todos/5 [HttpPut(\\\"{id}\\\")] public void Put(int id, [FromBody]Todo value) { var todo = todos.\", \"First((t) => t.ID == id); todo.Description = value.Description; todo.Completed = value.Completed; } \", \"// DELETE api/todos/5 [HttpDelete(\\\"{id}\\\")] public void Delete(int id) { } }\\n```\\n\\nTo understand this \", \"class, it's important to understand a few things: First, the square-bracketed declarations outside e\", \"ach method are what .NET calls 'custom attributes,' which, true story, figured prominently in the de\", \"sign for JSR-175 annotations. The attributes provide information (via reflection, same way annotatio\", \"ns do) about how HTTP verbs should match against the methods-so, for example, the ASP.NET runtime ca\", \"n know that the two Get() methods should both be invoked when an incoming GET request is made.\\n\\nThe \", \"other half of that binding, of course, is knowing the partial URL pattern that should trigger the me\", \"thod. Notice that the controller class itself has an attribute, 'Routing,' which contains the string\", \" 'api/[controller].' The square-bracketed 'controller' is to tell the ASP.NET runtime to use the nam\", \"e of the class, minus its '-Controller' suffix, so the URL pattern for all of these API endpoints is\", \" 'api/ todos.' From here, standard REST conventions kick in-a GET to 'api/todos' should return all o\", \"f the TODO items, so the Get() method taking no parameters and returning an IEnumerable&lt;Todo&gt; \", \"(think of it as a high-level iterator interface) is the right one to invoke here. If, on the other h\", \"and, a caller wants a single TODO, they'll issue a request with a URL pattern of 'api/todos/' plus t\", \"he ID of the TODO requested. The second Get() method indicates that the URL pattern includes '{id},'\", \" so 'api/ todos/3' will extract '3' and pass it for the value of 'id' to the method. Ditto for the P\", \"ut and Delete methods.\\n\\nThe full details of routing are in the ASP.NET documentation, but this shoul\", \"d be sufficient to understand what's happening here. To see the new controller in action, just do a \", \"'dotnet run' from the 'todoapi' directory, and point an HTTP client (curl or Postman) at http://loca\", \"lhost:5000/api/todos to see the JSON representations handed back.\\n\\n## ASP.NET Core MVC\\n\\nHTTP-based A\", \"PIs are nice, but when we need a traditional server-side rendered application, ASP.NET provides a tr\", \"aditional MVC framework called (not surprisingly) ASP.NET Core MVC. It's the same MVC we find in mos\", \"t modern web frameworks; views are rendered using a particular template syntax, called 'Razor' (or '\", \"Razor pages') that is designed to be expressive yet terse. It's a syntax inspired from other similar\", \" frameworks, particularly JSP and Ruby-on-Rails, but also tried to be reasonably familiar to generat\", \"ions of ASP and ASP.NET WebForms developers. Controllers look almost the same as they do in the API \", \"scenario, and models, of course, are just C# classes representing the domain.\\n\\nRazor templates use a\", \" .cshtml extension, and like JSP, they use different syntax to indicate which parts of the page are \", \"to be interpreted in a code-aware manner, as opposed to being taken literally as output format. Razo\", \"r syntax uses the '@' symbol to set off code blocks or other processing statements in several differ\", \"ent ways; for example, to do a simple 'for' loop within a page, Razor uses an '@for' to set off the \", \"loop. Unlike JSP, however, the Razor syntax is clear enough that there isn't a need to require expli\", \"cit symbols to set off between code and HTML output:\\n\\n```\\n<h2>Welcome</h2> <ul> @for (int i = 0; i <\", \" 3; i++) { <li>Beetlejuice</li> } </ul>\\n```\\n\\nViews, of course, can make use of objects and data prov\", \"ided by a controller, often by making use of a predefined key-value map called ViewData. If we want \", \"the message and the number of times it should be printed to be set up by a controller (perhaps the c\", \"ontroller is obtaining it from HTML query parameters or a database), then the controller can set tho\", \"se by using the keys 'Message' and 'NumTimes' in the ViewData dictionary, respectively. The view can\", \" then display them like this:\\n\\n```\\n<h2>Welcome</h2> <ul> @for (int i = 0; i < (int)ViewData[\\\"NumTime\", \"s\\\"]; i++) { <li>@ViewData[\\\"Message\\\"]</li> } </ul>\\n```\\n\\nIn essence, ViewData is the ASP.NET equivalen\", \"t to Servlet 'request' scope.\\n\\nThe controller perspective that drives this looks remarkably similar \", \"to what a servlet controller would do, with a few differences:\\n\\n```\\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; \", \"using System.Text.Encodings.Web; namespace MvcMovie.Controllers { public class HelloWorldController \", \": Controller { public IActionResult Welcome(string name, int numTimes = 1) { ViewData[\\\"Message\\\"] = \\\"\", \"Hello \\\" + name; ViewData[\\\"NumTimes\\\"] = numTimes; return View(); } } }\\n```\\n\\nNotice that the Welcome m\", \"ethod takes two parameters, which will be filled in from HTML query parameters, fills in the ViewDat\", \"a dictionary, and then calls 'View,' which then looks for a Razor page file whose name matches that \", \"of the method-in this case, it will be looking for 'Welcome.cshtml.' ASP.NET Core MVC has a number o\", \"f ways to adjust and change these conventions, but out of the box, the convention-based approach mak\", \"es it simpler and easier than the configuration descriptor approach of older Servlet versions.\\n\\nASP.\", \"NET Core MVC obviously consists of a great deal more than just what we've discussed here, but the un\", \"derlying message should be clear: ASP.NET Core (both the MVC and the Web API versions) learned a gre\", \"at deal from its contemporaries, including those in the Servlet world (JSP, the Play framework, and \", \"more), and as such, it will be very straightforward for a Java developer to pick up and explore.\\n\\nFo\", \"r those interested in a deeper dive into the code above, consider having a look into this tutorial: \", \"https://aka.ms/first-web-api.\\n\\n## Entity Framework Core\\n\\nOf course, being able to access the server \", \"and pass JSON back and forth is only half the story; the other half is taking that data and storing \", \"it. Or rather, storing it, indexing it, searching it, collating it, sorting it, drawing pretty graph\", \"s with it, and more. When working with a relational database, the technology Microsoft offers its .N\", \"ET constituents is called Entity Framework, or EF, and in many respects it works like any other obje\", \"ct/relational mapping framework does. Thanks to some of the language features in C#, however, in man\", \"y cases working with EF is actually easier than working with JPA or Hibernate.\\n\\nLike much in the .NE\", \"T universe, Entity Framework is undergoing a bit of a reshuffle; what used to be a closed, proprieta\", \"ry source base is now open, and as EF was opened to the world, the project owners thought a (slight)\", \" rebrand seemed appropriate. As a result, the open-source version of EF is called 'Entity Framework \", \"Core,' and to begin using it, we need to install it into the project via NuGet, either by using the \", \"Package Manager in Visual Studio, or by using the command-line for .NET Core by entering:\\n\\ndotnet ad\", \"d package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\\n\\nThis is, of course, assuming we are using SQLServ\", \"er-since not everybody uses SQL Server, however, a number of different EF database providers are ava\", \"ilable, including MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Firebase, and a few more. (Third-party vendors are consta\", \"ntly introducing new ones, in a manner similar to the JDBC driver ecosystem, so bear in mind that Mi\", \"crosoft may not even know all the EF providers in the world.)\\n\\nThere're a few 'management' tasks tha\", \"t will be easier to do from the command-line, and EF has a command-line package that installs 'insid\", \"e' the standard .NET Core command-line tool, but as of this writing, making use of it requires addin\", \"g a line by hand to the project's .csproj file:\\n\\n```\\n<ItemGroup> <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\\\"Mi\", \"crosoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet\\\" Version=\\\"2.0.0\\\" /> </ItemGroup>\\n```\\n\\nIn addition, the EF C\", \"ore command-ling tooling requires another dependent package:\\n\\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFra\", \"meworkCore.Design\\n\\nAt this point, EF should be installed and ready to go. More detailed instructions\", \" can be found on the Microsoft docs site at https://aka.ms/ef-install.\\n\\nFundamentally, the most crit\", \"ical element to using EF from a project is the DbContext. This is a class from which a project will \", \"create a derived class that represents the 'context' for this project against the database-it will b\", \"e a repository, session, and gateway, all rolled into one. Like many object/ relational tools, it al\", \"so provides some core behavior, including some migration capabilities (database versioning).\\n\\nLike H\", \"ibernate or JPA, EF uses classes to represent entities in the database, and these classes are often \", \"referred to as 'model' objects, since they typically serve that purpose in an MVC and/or Web API app\", \"lication. These will usually look like 'plain old C# objects,' with the odd custom attribute to help\", \" give EF some additional hints about how to map to the database table they represent.\\n\\nFor example, \", \"if the application is a blog, then we will want classes representing a blog, and blog post, represen\", \"ting a single blog entry. But there's also some blog metadata we might want to track that wouldn't b\", \"e appropriate to store in the database (such as whether the blog was stored in the database), which \", \"we will want Entity Framework to ignore entirely. One way to do this is to use a custom attribute, o\", \"r the EF Fluent API can indicate that the blog metadata class should be ignored using the 'OnModelCr\", \"eating' method, invoked when the database schema is created.\\n\\n```\\npublic class BloggingContext : DbC\", \"ontext { public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; } protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder\", \" modelBuilder) { modelBuilder.Ignore<BlogMetadata>(); } } public class Blog { public int BlogId { ge\", \"t; set; } public string Url { get; set; } public List<Post> Posts { get; set; } public BlogMetadata \", \"Metadata { get; set; } } public class Post { public int PostId { get; set; } public string Title { g\", \"et; set; } public string Content { get; set; } public Blog Blog { get; set; } } public class BlogMet\", \"adata { public DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; } }\\n```\\n\\nThe 'Id' fields, of course, are typi\", \"cally primary key integer columns in the database, and the List of Posts is a classic one-to-many re\", \"lationship. All of this will be eminently familiar to any user of Hibernate, JPA, or other object-re\", \"lational modeling system. What will be different will be the way in which queries and modifiers are \", \"run; thanks to LINQ, Entity Framework uses an entirely new style of query starting from the DbSet fi\", \"elds modeled on the DbContext-inheriting class. To do a query to fetch all the blogs from the system\", \", we simply create an instance of the context inside of a 'using' block (which is the inspiration fo\", \"r the try-with-resources block in Java7), and use that instance to obtain the set of Blog instances \", \"and iterate through them:\\n\\n```\\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext()) { foreach (var blog in co\", \"ntext.Blogs) { // do something with the blog } }\\n```\\n\\nContrary to what we experienced during the hey\", \"day of EJB Entity Beans, however, this isn't a case of early loading or late loading; under the hood\", \", Entity Framework is making use of 'enumerator objects' (very similar to Java8 streams and the Java\", \" Iterable&lt;T&gt; interface) to fetch objects in batches, just as a typical database cursor would d\", \"o.\\n\\nIn the Java world, however, filtering that list of blogs to include only those that have 'dotnet\", \"' in the URL presented problems-either the filtering happens on the database side, in which case the\", \" query has to be translated to SQL, or the filtering happens on the client side, which means the ent\", \"ire collection has to be brought over the network. With LINQ, however, this looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nus\", \"ing (var context = new BloggingContext()) { foreach (var blog in context.Blogs .Where(b => b.Url.Con\", \"tains(\\\"dotnet\\\"))) { // do something with the blog } }\\n```\\n\\nBut this has the same drawbacks as before\", \"; instead, we can use an 'expression tree,' a feature of LINQ that compiles into a runtime structure\", \" that reflects the compiled code:\\n\\n```\\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext()) { var allDotnetBl\", \"ogUrls = from blog in context.Blogs where blog.Url.Contains(\\\"dotnet\\\") select blog.Url;\\n```\\n\\n```\\nfore\", \"ach (var url in allDotnetBlogUrls) { // do something with the blog URL // note we don't have the ent\", \"ire Blog, just the Url } }\\n```\\n\\nThis 'from-where-select' syntax that looks so much like SQL isn't; i\", \"t's a syntax that's designed to look similar to SQL and offer many of the same kinds of operators an\", \"d options. However, this isn't an SQL query-it will not be sent to the database. Instead, the expres\", \"sion tree is analyzed-and optimizedby the EF plumbing to generate an efficient SQL statement, on a d\", \"river-by-driver basis. This means that the query filters and restrictions are analyzed on the client\", \" side, but sent to the database to be executed-for example, the above turns into a 'SELECT url FROM \", \"blog WHERE\\u2026' using whatever primitives to do a string-containment check that the database and EF pro\", \"vider offers. This is really the best-of-both-worlds scenario. Couple that with the compile-time typ\", \"e checking that the C# compiler provides against the model objects, and you have a solution that is \", \"entirely new to the Java world. (Not impossible to provide, mind you, but still something the Java w\", \"orld currently lacks.)\\n\\nUpdates and modifications entail making modifications on the model object, a\", \"nd those changes will be sent to the database when the context object goes out of the using block's \", \"scope. To add a new blog, construct the object and add it to the DbSet on the context object; to rem\", \"ove it, use the context's DbSet again. And should you really, really want to write raw SQL, the cont\", \"ext object provides that capacity.\\n\\nThere is, of course, much more to discuss about Entity Framework\", \"-it's every bit as rich and powerful as JPA, and as such, definitely larger than just what we can co\", \"ver in a single paper. For more examples of LINQ syntax, check out https://aka.ms/101LinqSamples. Fo\", \"r 101 LINQ samples, and for more information on Entity Framework itself, head over to the EF documen\", \"tation home at https://docs. microsoft.com/ef/core/.\\n\\n## Wrapping Up\\n\\nTo suggest that this is someho\", \"w the end of the story is ludicrous. The .NET ecosystem holds a rich tapestry of open-source project\", \"s and commercial tools and frameworks, and that means that a developer could, if they wished, spend \", \"their entire career just discovering the boundaries there. We haven't even begun to discuss the alte\", \"rnative languages for the .NET platform, either from Microsoft (F#, an object/functional hybrid that\", \" fills the same role as Scala, or good old Visual Basic, one of the original dynamic languages) or f\", \"rom the community (check out Boo, a Python-inspired dynamic language). We haven't begun to explore t\", \"he different open-source frameworks that do dependency injection. We haven't begun to explore the di\", \"fferent frameworks for doing unit testing, or the online tooling from Microsoft to provide agile pro\", \"ject support. We haven't even mentioned Azure.\\n\\nThis is a brave new land, intrepid adventurer, but r\", \"est easy: Much of what you know from your time in the world of Java will serve you well here. The co\", \"ncepts are similar, but different enough to be interesting. The platforms are powerful, and the comm\", \"unities open and inviting. The tools are easily obtained, and the tutorials plenty. You might even r\", \"ecognize a few familiar names, those who have come before you across the pond and gone on this adven\", \"ture before you. Be the tourist, if you like, but know that there's plenty of room to build your own\", \" home and settle down here, even if it's only a summer home. Come in, and be welcome.\\n\\nAnd, unlike a\", \" certain young boy on his first trip to France, you won't have to worry about somebody's father tryi\", \"ng to convince you that 'escargot' is French for 'tater tots.'\"]"
