It wa\", \"s our first trip out of the country, and aside from the ridiculously long flight-eight hours on an a\", \"irplane feels like forever to somebody who hasn't yet finished their first decade of life-I really h\", \"ad no idea of what to expect. In fact, in an amusing anecdote my father has yet to tire of telling, \", \"I remember having to sit down with my parents in front of a globe so that they could explain to me t\", \"hat 'the United States' was not, in fact, synonymous with 'the world.'\\n\\nIt was entirely a trip of fi\", \"rsts: my first experience wandering around in a world where I couldn't understand any of the written\", \" signs, my first experience eating food I couldn't recognize, and my first experience feeling comple\", \"tely lost in the world around me. I found, to my eight-year-old horror, that I couldn't even figure \", \"out which bathroom to use-which, considering I had just the year before managed to convince my mothe\", \"r I didn't need to be escorted to the bathroom and back, was of particular concern. I didn't want he\", \"r to start thinking I actually needed adult supervision. This was clearly not my home, and I was mor\", \"e than a little terrified of it.\\n\\nVisiting a foreign land, particularly to someone who has cocooned \", \"themselves entirely in the concepts and cultures of 'home,' can be intimidating and overwhelming wit\", \"hout a guide. On that trip to France I had my parents, and despite neither of them speaking anything\", \" close to fluent French, they managed to guide us through the tricky parts. (French-English guideboo\", \"ks are a wonderful thing.)\\n\\nFor the typical Java developer, finding a guide to exploring the .NET ec\", \"osystem can be tricky, since the average Java developer can still hearken back to a time when expres\", \"sing an interest in looking at .NET was tantamount to declaring a desire to betray everything good a\", \"nd right in the world (or so it seemed, at least at the time).\\n\\nIn this paper, I will serve as your \", \"guide to the .NET world. I've been a part of the .NET ecosystem almost as long as I've been a part o\", \"f Java's. I started with Java in 1996; I started with what would become .NET in 2000, even before it\", \" was announced. I've built applications in both, written books for both, and explored the source for\", \" both. They're closer to one another than you might think, but each has been fundamentally influence\", \"d by the people using them. In fact, it's not a bad analogy to think of them as twin brothers, separ\", \"ated at birth, raised by different sets of parents. Same DNA, but shaped by their experiences and ev\", \"ents to be different in a number of interesting places.\\n\\nIf you're a Java developer, looking to get \", \"started exploring the .NET ecosystem, then suspend what you think you know, take my hand, and let's \", \"take a trip to a foreign land. Doing so will require a little history to understand how things came \", \"to be, then a quick set of instructions on how to get the tooling set up (and which tooling you want\", \", depending on your preferences). Once the environment is set up, we can pick up the critical differ\", \"ences between C# and Java, and start diving into some of the central frameworks in this world-ASP.NE\", \"T, Entity Framework, and a few others. When we\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nfinish up, if you're following along\", \", you'll have everything you need to start your own exploration of the .NET community, and from ther\", \"e you'll get to draw your own conclusions and make your own opinions.\\n\\nMost importantly, you'll know\", \" how to order off the menu and tell the bathrooms apart.\\n\\nReady?\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nIf\", \" you'd like to skip the walk down memory lane, you can jump to the next section, Getting Started.\\n\\nO\", \"stensibly, the history of .NET begins in October of 2000, at Microsoft's Professional Developer Conf\", \"erence (PDC), when Microsoft announced to the world that they were working on a new programming plat\", \"form, on which would rest the fate of all Microsoft development to follow. It was called .NET, it wo\", \"uld be the backbone for their upcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would be a part of their\", \" data management system (nicknamed 'SQLServer.NET'), and it would form the core development platform\", \" for building interconnected applications into the future by leveraging emerging standards such as X\", \"ML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few others the world had not yet really come to understand. It would be the pr\", \"incipal competitor platform to their principal development rival at the time, Sun Microsystems, and \", \"its Java platform. And the world could see that the shot was fired, the line in the sand drawn, and \", \"the armies drawn up; clearly, this was Microsoft copying the efforts of its competitors, seeking dom\", \"inance, and\\u2026.\\n\\nAnd most of the world completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it had c\", \"ome to exist, and what Microsoft really sought to obtain from it.\\n\\nIn fact, it's fair to suggest tha\", \"t many within the Microsoft ecosystem misunderstood what .NET was really about; once announced, the \", \"marketing machine took over. Much effort was wasted due to the entanglement of '.NET' with 'web serv\", \"ices,' and it would take the better part of a decade before people could understand that the two rea\", \"lly had nothing intrinsically to do with one another any more than 'Perl' did with 'databases.' Micr\", \"osoft management compounded all this confusion by re-branding the '.NET' suffix to a number of their\", \" products, which they later corrected but well after the damage had been done.\\n\\nBut despite all that\", \", solid engineering rests at the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made it harder to see\", \", but it's always been there. To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its proper his\", \"torical context: that, in truth, it was the simple 'next step' along an evolutionary chain that stre\", \"tched back much further than that October keynote almost two decades ago.\\n\\n## Of components, managed\", \" environments, and code\\n\\nIn the beginning, there was C.\\n\\nTo be more accurate about it, in the beginn\", \"ing a number of programming languages were created to make it easier to produce programs that knew h\", \"ow to execute on a single chip. They integrated directly with the hardware, making use of the facili\", \"ties there to obtain memory, interact with the disk, and present data to the display for the user to\", \" understand. In time, we as an industry found that this direct-hardware interaction had its drawback\", \"s, and we sought to create a series of abstractions on top of that hardware, to help coordinate the \", \"use of the hardware across multiple simultaneously\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nexecuting programs. We called th\", \"at first attempt at regulating and managing the hardware an operating system. And it was pretty good\", \". So good, in fact, that numerous flavors of operating system were born, including Microsoft's Windo\", \"ws operating system, and Solaris, and macOS (though it was called 'System 7' back then), and Linux, \", \"and a few others whose names exist now only in the history books and dusty corners of Usenet forums.\", \" (Bonus points if you recognize these names: Minix, Mach, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even more bonus\", \" points if you ever ran one of them. If you ever ran DOS, though, it just means you're old.)\\n\\nThe bi\", \"gger, more important issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system itself-\", \"that programmers found it helpful and useful to have 'something else' working with their programs. T\", \"hat 'something else' would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs executed and behav\", \"ed, rather than assuming that every single nuance had to be the programmers' responsibility.\\n\\nThis c\", \"oncept, in large, is essentially that of a 'managed environment.' Although it has its roots in opera\", \"ting systems, it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of containers an\", \"d cloud: that there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are responsible f\", \"or details that the programmer doesn't want to have to deal with. Operating systems are managed envi\", \"ronments in that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to schedule the execu\", \"tion of threads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network ports or data files\", \". Virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in that they regulate t\", \"he access and reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode format into CPU-native \", \"instructions, and prevent the direct access of memory (except under very specific circumstances) in \", \"order to avoid process termination by careless programming. Containers such as Docker are managed en\", \"vironments in that they provide a context around an executable to mimic a precise environment-config\", \"uration files, environment variables, and shared network settings-so that developers can be assured \", \"that the environment outside their programs are consistent regardless of where they are deployed.\\n\\nB\", \"y the early '90s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for Windows de\", \"velopers to be able to take 'the next step forward' in development evolution. The 'GUI revolution' o\", \"f the mid-'80s was largely finished; programs weren't just about 'dialogs and data,' but now needed \", \"to integrate more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for example) and start\", \" taking advantage of networking in greater detail. (Old developers like me will remember that it was\", \" around 1995 that references to HTTP and 'the World Wide Web' were just starting to appear in public\", \"ations and technology journals.)\\n\\nAs is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges \", \"emerged. C++ developers had been speaking of 'reusable code' for several years, but it was Visual Ba\", \"sic (and Delphi, along with several other '4GL' variants) that demonstrated actual practical code re\", \"use, in the form of 'controls': widgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly w\", \"ithout requiring in-depth knowledge about the controls' implementation. Simply obtain the library, p\", \"ut it into the right place within the development environment, drag-and-drop the control into the co\", \"nstruction area, and lo, the developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of 'ap\", \"plication frameworks,' like MFC and OWL, but 'GUI builders' had demonstrated that the concept of 'co\", \"ntrols' could be leveraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and\", \" events; now\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nMicrosoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the bigger w\", \"orld beyond GUI development. More importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship-make it \", \"possible for outside developers to build 'things' that could be used by existing things (such as the\", \" operating system or, perhaps, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their implementation.\\n\", \"\\nTo do that, they needed to create a managed environment that would work across a variety of differe\", \"nt languages, but all operating under the same rules. That effort, called the Component Object Model\", \" (COM), was the first of several 'managed platforms' that emerged during the earlyand mid-'90s. (Iro\", \"nically, several open-source efforts would go after this same space many years after Microsoft decla\", \"red COM 'finished,' including Mozilla's XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in that it became the back\", \"bone of Windows development for a significant percentage of the Windows platform. But it still faile\", \"d in that it left programs vulnerable to many of the same things that had plagued them before: memor\", \"y leaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpected process termination at the first mistake. It was clear \", \"that, despite the managed platform, writing code in a 'native' language (such as C/C++ or Delphi) st\", \"ill wasn't a particularly great place to be.\\n\\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that Sun Micr\", \"osystems demonstrated the HotJava browser to the world, the centerpiece of which was this language t\", \"hat could be used to write executable bits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft had come to\", \" the realization that this was what it was missing: a 'managed language' to run on top of their mana\", \"ged platform. A managed language had exactly the right 'distance' from the underlying operating syst\", \"em they were seeking-garbage collection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashes, and \", \"the virtual machine could help enforce stronger security controls that the world had just started to\", \" realize they needed. It was, in many ways, a perfect match. Microsoft invested resources into build\", \"ing their own JVM, extended their IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrated COM \", \"into the runtime.\\n\\nUnfortunately, in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own destruc\", \"tion.\\n\\n## Hello, .NET\\n\\nDivorces are never a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one is alway\", \"s fraught with opinion, revisionist history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997/1998, t\", \"wo facts were becoming clear: one, Sun didn't care for Microsoft's work increasing interoperability \", \"between their JVM and native COM components in Windows 1 , and two, Microsoft and Java were going to\", \" part ways, one way or another. (Who got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)\\n\\nEither certain\", \" groups within Microsoft could see the writing on the wall or they had come to find issues (real or \", \"perceived) with the Java Virtual Machine; either way, by 1998, a new effort came to life inside of M\", \"icrosoft, designed to bring a new managed platform and managed language into the world. Originally i\", \"ntended as the successor to COM, it went through a variety of names, including\\n\\n1  For the curious, \", \"Microsoft offered additional platform-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with native COM co\", \"mponents. The irony of this is deep, considering that Sun had actually allowed for COM-specific nati\", \"ve interfaces in their JNI specification-the first three methods in the interface table for a JNIEnv\", \" ('JNI environment') object were specifically left 'reserved' for the necessary three methods (AddRe\", \"f, Release, and QueryInterface) of every COM interface object. Those three slots are still reserved \", \"to this day.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n'COM+,' the 'Component Object Runtime' (COR), the 'Universal RunTime' \", \"(URT), and 'NextGeneration Windows Services' (NGWS) before finally being introduced to the world as \", \"'.NET' at that October 2000 PDC. Along with it would come a new language, code-named 'COOL' (suppose\", \"dly to stand for the 'Component-Oriented Object Language,' although opinions vary now) and later ren\", \"amed 'C#.'\\n\\nWhile most observers considered C# and the CLR (the Common Language Runtime, the virtual\", \" machine executing the bytecode) to be direct competitors of Java, Microsoft took careful steps to e\", \"nsure that it was 'open' in ways that Java was not: where the JVM was designed from the beginning to\", \" be a virtual machine for a single language, the CLR embraced a more polyglot approach, with Microso\", \"ft even going so far as to recruit several universities and companies to create new languages for th\", \"is platform and/or adapt existing ones. This project, nicknamed 'Project 7' (for the 7 groups that p\", \"articipated), debuted several of these languages during .NET's introduction, and included CLR flavor\", \"s of Eiffel, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of these languages gained any traction after the first few\", \" years of existence, and most no longer exist, but their presence had the effect on Microsoft of 'ke\", \"eping them honest' with respect to other languages beyond C# and Visual Basic as the platform grew a\", \"nd evolved. (Microsoft itself would later go on to introduce a number of new CLR-based languages, in\", \"cluding a compiled-to-binary version of ECMAScript, two different efforts at bringing managed coding\", \" to C++, a hybrid object/functional language called F#, and several more research languages.)\\n\\nHowev\", \"er, Microsoft also sought to make sure that .NET was not a proprietary effort by investing thousands\", \" of man-hours into the creation of a series of international specifications-through the European Com\", \"puter Manufacturer's Association (ECMA 2 )-to ensure that C# and the underlying platform were both o\", \"pen industry standards. C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and the underlying runtime was giv\", \"en the name the 'Common Language Infrastructure' (CLI), and accepted and ratified as ECMA-335. Intel\", \", HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in keeping these specifications up to\", \" date with changes to the language and the platform, the most recent updates 3  coming in 2012 for t\", \"he CLI and 2017 for C#.\\n\\nWith the introduction of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpected si\", \"de-effect: members of the open-source community began to examine building a 'clean-room' implementat\", \"ion of them. While the CLI Specification didn't include any of the Windows-specific features (such a\", \"s a deep COM integration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution for th\", \"eir existing developer base, the CLI Specification itself provided enough integration points to make\", \" it interesting to implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one such proj\", \"ect, calling it Mono.\\n\\nThe specification also gave Microsoft some room to do what some within the co\", \"mpany had been looking to do for quite a while: provide a research and experimentation vehicle for t\", \"he academic and research communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripped-down version\", \" of the CLR source code, code-named 'Rotor,' distributed under an open-source license they created, \", \"called the\\n\\n2  ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification for the language commonly known\", \" as 'JavaScript,' but is more rightly called 'ECMAScript,' governed as ECMA-262.\\n\\n3  CLI: https://ww\", \"w.iso.org/standard/58046.html and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ Ecma-335\", \".htm; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n'Sh\", \"ared Source' license, giving it the formal name 'Shared Source CLI' or 'SSCLI.' While Mono would rem\", \"ain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, and Rotor of even less interest to\", \" those outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source mindset were sown. Over time, Mono wou\", \"ld be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own company, Xamarin, which would faithfully paral\", \"lel the work described by the specifications and periodically try out new ideas for the opensource c\", \"ommunity to consider.\\n\\nMicrosoft officially released the first version of C# and the CLR in 2002, an\", \"d new versions came roughly three years apart after that: C# 2.0 in 2005, and C# 3.0 in 2008. Each w\", \"as contained in a product release of Visual Studio, such that C# 2.0 and version 2.0 of the CLR runt\", \"ime was released with Visual Studio 2005, and C# 3.0 and CLR 3.5 came with Visual Studio 2008. Micro\", \"soft then shifted to a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012, Visual S\", \"tudio 2015, and most recently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the versions of C# and the CLR started f\", \"alling out of lockstep with Visual Studio, deliberately, for a couple of reasons.\\n\\nThe first was tha\", \"t Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, and was starting to unbundle its va\", \"rious parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independent, parts. F#, which first shipped \", \"'out of the box' in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to start down the opensource path, la\", \"rgely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project, it had never really embraced bein\", \"g commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place. Microsoft started working shortly\", \" thereafter on an open-source rewrite of its entire compiler toolchain, code-named 'Roslyn.' By the \", \"time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem were starting to ship independently, wi\", \"th Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for developers to gather the parts of the ecosys\", \"tem they desired more easily. Open-source package management (called NuGet), which began life well o\", \"utside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated into Visual Studio so that NuGet came 'ou\", \"t of the box,' much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java IDEs.\\n\\nMono, meanwhile, had started to g\", \"ain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular, the gaming toolkit Unity had expressed\", \" interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running inside the Unity toolkit. Unity-based gam\", \"es could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the JavaScript-on-.NET implementation that \", \"Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a Pythoninspired .NET language called Boo. Additionall\", \"y, the open-source community produced another .NET implementation, the .NET Micro Framework, specifi\", \"cally aimed at embedded software systems and small-scale hardware such as the Arduino platform.\\n\\nAll\", \" of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, Microsoft announced that the source for A\", \"SP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to anyone who wanted to look at it. It wasn'\", \"t full open-source yet, though, in that they weren't accepting pull requests. It was, however, an im\", \"portant step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It announced that it would completely open\", \"-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making it available to any platform and accept p\", \"ull requests from any developer so inclined. A new .NET implementation would be completely open-sour\", \"ce and hosted on GitHub, called .NET Core. It also announced the creation of the .NET Foundation, an\", \" industry consortium of groups dedicated to the growth of the .NET platform, in\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nmuc\", \"h the same fashion that the Java Community Process governs the continued growth of the Java platform\", \" 4 .\\n\\nTo be sure, Microsoft made some missteps along the way, and definitely learned a few hard less\", \"ons about its relationship with the open-source community, but by late 2017, Microsoft was statistic\", \"ally the biggest contributor on GitHub (measured in terms of total numbers of contributors 5 ), and \", \"all of its key components-language, runtime, libraries, and many of its tools-were available for dow\", \"nload on GitHub.\\n\\nMicrosoft also started to get more serious about the cross-platform/portability as\", \"pects of the .NET ecosystem. Xamarin, which by 2009 had started producing tools that could cross-com\", \"pile .NET bytecode into native applications for iOS and Android platforms (the catchy-named 'MonoDro\", \"id' and less-catchy 'Mono for iOS' toolkits), was flourishing, and Microsoft realized that a practic\", \"al story for being able to share non-UI portions of code across multiple platforms was necessary if \", \"they wanted to avoid developer confusion.\\n\\nWhile the ECMA Specifications had discussed different 'pr\", \"ofiles' for levels of .NET standardization, these profiles were in many ways similar to their 'Java \", \"Standard Edition,' 'Java Micro Edition,' and 'Java Enterprise Edition' cousins-a little unwieldy in \", \"a number of ways, but most notably in that there wasn't really a good way to guarantee compatibility\", \" across platforms and implementation versions-if code is compiled by the Java6 compiler, it is safe \", \"to assume that it will continue to run on the Java6 virtual machine from whence it was compiled, but\", \" the Java APIs do change from release to release, and this has tripped up the unwary Java developer \", \"from time to time.\\n\\nThus, in 2016, Microsoft announced the '.NET Standard 1.0' profile, a collection\", \" not of relatively vague implementation documents, but an actual API standard, such that a developer\", \" who sought to build a library that could be used by a variety of different platforms (across a cert\", \"ain number of versions of that platform, even) could know that anything that implemented .NET Standa\", \"rd 1.0 would be able to consume that library, regardless of where that code is running-on a web serv\", \"er, on a mobile device, or even on somebody's VR helmet (running a 3D interactive application writte\", \"n with Unity).\\n\\nWhich brings us, now, to the current day.\\n\\n4  Ironically, Microsoft's move to the .N\", \"ET Foundation comes at the same time Oracle is looking to move away from the JCP; both companies hav\", \"e experience with standards organizations, and neither wants to see innovation stifled in committee.\", \"\\n\\n5  http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-open-source-2016-9\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Hello, s\", \"trange new world\\n\\nTo the Java developer, this is a strange, strange world compared to the one they g\", \"limpsed into back in 2000.\\n\\nFor starters, the Java world looks wildly different than it once did.

Microsoft's language designers have been much more aggressive than Sun's when it com\", \"es to introducing new features into their respective languages, so for the most part a Java develope\", \"r's experience with C# will probably be characterized by 'Oh, sure, that all looks pretty similar-wa\", \"it, what is THAT?'\\n\\nBy the way, C# currently sits at version 7.2 at the time of this writing, and Mi\", \"crosoft's language designers have been just as aggressive in the latest revisions of the language as\", \" they were in the early ones. This is a language under constant evolution, for good or for ill. So t\", \"here's much to discuss, and we will not be able to cover the entire surface area of the language-the\", \" focus here will be only on those parts that will be unintuitive to the Java developer looking at 'a\", \"verage' C# code.\\n\\n## C# Basics\\n\\nTo begin, let's take a look at what was generated as part of those '\", \"HelloWorld' console applications, since that's probably the easiest way to get started.\\n\\n```\\nusing S\", \"ystem; namespace HelloDotNet { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\\\"\", \"Hello World!\\\"); } } }\\n```\\n\\nIt's pretty easy to spot a number of things right off the bat: C# is a C-\", \"family language, using curlybrackets to denote scope blocks and semicolons to terminate statements. \", \"Code is organized into\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nnamespaces using the 'namespace' keyword, and pretty clearly\", \" we have classes just as Java does. The Console class (part of the 'System' namespace) represents th\", \"e command-line input/output facilities, and WriteLine is obviously a synonym for 'println.' Square b\", \"rackets are used to denote an array in the same way they do in Java, and arrays in C# work almost ex\", \"actly the same way as they do in Java, save that they have been slightly more 'formalized' in that t\", \"here is a full-blown class, System. Array, that defines a number of methods and properties that all \", \"arrays will share. Core 'primitive' types are actually defined as full-blown classes, so that System\", \".Array is the 'class' representing each array instance, System.String is the 'string' primitive type\", \", System.Int32 is the 'int' primitive type, and so on. All types, whether 'primitive' (what .NET cal\", \"ls 'value types') or 'class,' all inherit from the base System.Object type, with value types being '\", \"boxed' to objects when necessary. (This was the inspiration for autoboxing rules in Java5, in fact.)\", \" As a result, 'System.String s' and 'string s' are actually entirely equivalent declarations. New va\", \"lue types can be defined, but it's pretty rare.\\n\\nLet's start with some of the more straightforward p\", \"arts of the language.\\n\\n## Starting exploration: classes, properties, and methods\\n\\nC# 1.0 was, in lar\", \"ge measure, a near-direct clone of Java, with some keyword changes and some new features that Java h\", \"as debated for years: explicit properties and delegates (an early form of lambda expressions). Thus,\", \" we can write the traditional 'Person' type in C# like so:\\n\\n```\\nclass Person { public string FirstNa\", \"me { get { return this.firstName; } set { this.firstName = value; } } private string firstName; publ\", \"ic string LastName { get { return this.lastName; } set { this.lastName = value; } } private string l\", \"astName; public int Age { get { return this.age; } set { this.age = value; }\\n```\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n``\", \"`\\n} private int age; public Person(string fn, string ln, int a) { this.FirstName = fn; this.LastName\", \" = ln; this.Age = a; } }\\n```\\n\\nProperties can be read-only by eliminating the 'set' clause, and write\", \"-only (if that makes sense, which it rarely does) by eliminating the 'get' clause. The implicit para\", \"meter to a 'set' clause is always called 'value,' and there are no restrictions to what a property-g\", \"et or property-set clause can do within its body, although 95% of the time they simply read and writ\", \"e a field within the class.\\n\\nSo far, if anything, it seems more verbose than Java. However, that was\", \" the C# language as of 15 years ago-they've made a few changes along the way.\\n\\nOne very common chang\", \"e is to the requirement to actually provide a body to the property-get and property-set clauses; as \", \"is the case in Java, 95% of the time these clauses simply wrap around a field and provide encapsulat\", \"ed access and nothing else. Which means, frankly, that the time spent writing the implementation for\", \" these is pretty much a waste of time (and something that IDEA or other IDEs can generate for us). T\", \"he C# language designers agreed, and in C# 3.0 added the concept of 'autoimplemented properties,' wh\", \"ich asks the C# compiler to not only generate the property method implementations, but also synthesi\", \"ze the field used for the backing store. This simplifies the Person class down to:\\n\\n```\\nclass Person\", \" { public string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } public int Age { get; \", \"set; } public Person(string fn, string ln, int a) { this.FirstName = fn; this.LastName = ln; this.Ag\", \"e = a; } }\\n```\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nThat's\\u2026awfully terse. But what about those scenarios where we want t\", \"o have the property available to be read by anyone (public access), but only accessible for mutation\", \" from within the class (private access)? The get and set clauses can have different levels of access\", \", the most common idiom being:\\n\\n```\\nclass Person { public string FirstName { get; private set; } pub\", \"lic string LastName { get; private set; } public int Age { get; private set; } public Person(string \", \"fn, string ln, int a) { this.FirstName = fn; this.LastName = ln; this.Age = a; } }\\n```\\n\\nThis will ef\", \"fectively make the fields immutable from the outside yet still something we can change from the inte\", \"rior of the class. The field itself is synthesized by the compiler (usually with a straightforward n\", \"ame such as '\\\\_\\\\_$&lt;Person&gt;$&lt;FirstName&gt;@5417,' or something equally nonobvious), and won'\", \"t be directly accessible by code. (Granted, one can always use System.Reflectionthe .NET direct equi\", \"valent to Java's java.lang.reflect package-to access the field at runtime, but that's an awful lot o\", \"f work to work around something that can be discarded at any time.) For those rare situations where \", \"the auto-generated properties don't do the right thing, C# developers can always 'drop back' to writ\", \"ing the property clauses out longhand and wrapping a declared field.\\n\\nMethods, meanwhile, work prett\", \"y much the same way they do in Java, in terms of their declaration and syntax. Methods can be instan\", \"ce methods or static (although static method invocations must always go through the class name, wher\", \"eas Java will allow calling a static method through an instance variable-seriously, try it, it's wei\", \"rd), and parameters are declared in order with a type and a name:\\n\\n```\\npublic class Person { public \", \"string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } public int Age { get; set; } pub\", \"lic Person(string fn, string ln, int a) {\\n```\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n```\\nthis.FirstName = fn; this.LastNam\", \"e = ln; this.Age = a; } public void SayHello(string recipient) { Console.WriteLine(\\\"Hello, {0}, I, {\", \"1}, say hello.\\\", recipient, FirstName); } } class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Person\", \" p = new Person(\\\"Ted\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 46); p.SayHello(\\\"Fred\\\"); } }\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, C# follows pretty\", \" much exactly the same rules that Java does for method declaration and invocation. But, again, C# al\", \"lows for some interesting variations on this theme.\\n\\nFor starters, C# has had the concept of 'method\", \" literals' since 1.0, though the syntax has changed over each successive revision of the language. T\", \"he first step was 'delegates,' essentially the ability to declare a method signature and then assign\", \" methods-on-object-instances to a given delegate instance, like so:\\n\\n```\\nclass Person { // . . . pub\", \"lic delegate void HelloProc(string recipient); public HelloProc IndirectSayHello; } class Program { \", \"static void Main(string[] args) { Person p = new Person(\\\"Ted\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 46); p.SayHello(\\\"Fred\\\"); p.\", \"IndirectSayHello = p.SayHello; p.IndirectSayHello(\\\"Fred\\\"); } }\\n```\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nThis was a prett\", \"y verbose way of doing method-reference-capture, and with successive versions of C#, they simplified\", \" it, particularly once the .NET platform introduced generics. (Yes, C# has generics, yes they look s\", \"yntactically almost identical to Java generics, but no, they don't work the same way when compiled-w\", \"here Java uses 'type erasure,' C# uses 'reified generics' and persists the generic definition all th\", \"e way into the compiled bytecode.) The 'delegate' keyword here introduces a new type-a function poin\", \"ter, if you will-and we can declare an instance of the delegate on the Person class, assign a method\", \" to it, and invoke the assigned method through that delegate.\\n\\n## Lambdas, type inference, and exten\", \"sion classes\\n\\nBy the time C# 3.0 came around, however, C# supported full-bore lambda syntax, complet\", \"e with method parameter type inference, so that we could write method literals in-line:\\n\\n```\\np.Indir\", \"ectSayHello = (recipient) => { Console.WriteLine(\\\"Hey, {0}. Whatever.\\\", recipient); }; p.IndirectSay\", \"Hello(\\\"Shaggy\\\");\\n```\\n\\nLambdas turned out to be a major turning point within the C# language, along w\", \"ith several other features of the C# 3.0 release, including local variable type inference, which sim\", \"ply allows for the keyword 'var' to appear in place of the type in a local variable declaration, lik\", \"e so:\\n\\n```\\nvar x = 12; var y = \\\"Fred\\\"; var z = p.IndirectSayHello; z(\\\"Wilma\\\");\\n```\\n\\nThe 'var' keywor\", \"d does not, as some in the Java world theorized at its introduction, create an untyped variable; the\", \" C# compiler simply infers the variable's type from the right-hand-side expression, and assigns that\", \" to the variable type. Thus, the 'x' variable is strongly typed as an integer (since that is an inte\", \"ger literally on the right-hand side), 'y' is a string, and 'z' is a delegate that accepts a method \", \"reference that takes a single string parameter and returns void. All the 'var' keyword does, simply,\", \" is allow the C# developer a brief respite from having to type out type signatures in places where t\", \"he compiler could figure it out on its own.\\n\\nOn top of this, Microsoft also introduced a fascinating\", \" feature called 'extension classes,' which has found its way into other languages such as Swift. In \", \"short, a class can write 'extension methods' that can effectively 'inject' themselves as method decl\", \"arations onto other classes, adding new functionality to classes already compiled. (It's vaguely rem\", \"iniscent of aspects as described by AspectJ, but a strictly limited subset thereof.)\\n\\nFor example, a\", \"ssume that it's becoming really common to want to count the number of words in a given String. In th\", \"e earliest days of Java, it was assumed that we could extend the String class to add that kind of fu\", \"nctionality, but Sun very quickly clamped down on that, made String final, and\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nearn\", \"ed the (short-lived) wrath of Java developers everywhere. Java developers were forced to write 'Stri\", \"ngUtils' classes that had static methods on them to count the words in a string, similar to this C# \", \"equivalent:\\n\\n```\\npublic class StringUtils { public static int WordCount(String str) { return str.Spl\", \"it(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length; } }\\n```\\n\\nFrankly, th\", \"ough, using this left a pretty bitter taste in everybody's mouth, since it smacked of doing procedur\", \"al programming. Java developers just learned to live with it; C# language designers said, 'We can go\", \" one step better.' If you agree that the class will never have any instance data and never be instan\", \"tiated as an instance (declare the class 'static'), then it can use the first parameter to declare a\", \" 'this' parameter, and essentially declare a method that will appear on the targeted class, like so:\", \"\\n\\n```\\npublic static class MyStringExtensions { public static int WordCount(this String str) { return\", \" str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length; } }\\n```\\n\\n(No\", \"te that 'String' is shorthand for 'System.String,' which is a synonym for the earlier type 'string.'\", \" All of the 'primitive types' in C# are aliases for the System-namespaced types, so 'int' is the sam\", \"e as 'System.Int32,' and so on. This has to do with how C# allows the declaration of 'value types,' \", \"and while a fascinating discussion in its own right, it's a little out-of-scope from what we're doin\", \"g here.)\\n\\nThis extension class means that now we can write the following:\\n\\n```\\nvar words = \\\"One two \", \"three four\\\"; var wordCount = words.WordCount(); // 4\\n```\\n\\nExtension classes don't just magically app\", \"ly everywhere, however-they must be brought into scope via the use of the 'using' statements, so tha\", \"t if we don't care to use the MyStringExtensions, the WordCount() method won't appear on String type\", \"s. And the original class remains unaffected, which means that the WordCount() extension (like all e\", \"xtensions) cannot have any impact on the internals of the extended class-in fact, it can't see any o\", \"f the internal members, and so can only ever be able to use the public interface of the extended cla\", \"ss. It's purely compiler syntactic sugar.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Language-INtegrated Query (LINQ)\\n\\nAll \", \"of this led up to one of the signature moments for the C# compiler with the 3.0 release: Language-IN\", \"tegrated Query, or LINQ, for short. To many in the Java community, LINQ represented everything that \", \"was wrong with Microsoft, accusing them of 'embedding SQL into the C# language' and turning C# into \", \"a 4GL that was proprietarily bound to SQL Server. As the Jedi Master put it, 'Amazing-every single p\", \"art of that sentence is entirely incorrect.' LINQ wasn't integrating SQL, it isn't about SQL Server,\", \" and it's actually built up around core language principles that had nothing to do with relational d\", \"atabases, much less integrated with SQL Server.\\n\\nLet's start by examining a simple collection of Per\", \"son objects in a list:\\n\\n```\\nvar people = new List<Person>() { new Person(\\\"Ted\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 45), new P\", \"erson(\\\"Charlotte\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 39), new Person(\\\"Michael\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 24), new Person(\\\"Matthew\\\", \\\"Neward\", \"\\\", 18), new Person(\\\"Beth\\\", \\\"Massi\\\", 39), new Person(\\\"Dustin\\\", \\\"Campbell\\\", 43) };\\n```\\n\\nSuppose I want\", \" to give everybody within this list a beer.

(If that's new to you, Venkat Subramaniam has some great \", \"conference lectures online that describe Java8 lambdas in more detail.) As far back as C# 3.0, Micro\", \"soft saw the need, and chose not only to layer functional principles into the language, but to put a\", \" syntax in place that would actually hide the fact that this was ever functional programming in the \", \"first place:\\n\\n```\\nvar drinkers = from p in people where p.Age > 21 select p;\\n```\\n\\nThis is a LINQ que\", \"ry expression, and despite the fact that it looks similar to SQL, it's actually invoking several fun\", \"ctional methods in sequence using a fluent interface; translated out of the SQL-like syntax, it look\", \"s more like:\\n\\n```\\ndrinkers = people.Where((p) => p.Age > 21);\\n```\\n\\nAll of the traditional functional\", \" operations are present here-map, filter, and the rest-but they 'hide' behind this query expression \", \"syntax. We'll talk more about the interesting features and implications of LINQ when we get to Entit\", \"y Framework in the last section, but for now, just think of\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nLINQ as a syntax that i\", \"s designed to deliberately bring some of the set-oriented nature of SQL and the functional-oriented \", \"nature of languages such as Haskell into the C# language as a first-class citizen.\\n\\n(For anybody who\", \" really wants to see LINQ taken to an absolute extreme, it can be instructional to look at Luke Hoba\", \"n's 'single-LINQ-expression-ray-tracer' blog post from 10 years ago, available at https://aka.ms/lin\", \"qraytracer. It will send chills down your back, one way or another.)\\n\\n## Asynchronous programming wi\", \"th Async/Await\\n\\nC# 4.0 introduced a number of interesting features, but C# 5.0 truly bucked the stat\", \"us quo by introducing language support for a form of asynchronous programming via the 'async' and 'a\", \"wait' keywords. While not a general-purpose, all-around concurrency feature, async/await added the a\", \"bility to easily add 'little concurrency' into common programming tasks such as issuing a request fo\", \"r a database query or executing a Web API request without having to manually manage the threads nece\", \"ssary to do so without blocking. Leveraging some work done elsewhere on the .NET platform (the Task \", \"Parallel Library, or TPL), C# essentially now allows developers to start some work and return a Task\", \"&lt;T&gt; object, which represents that additional work. At the source code level, 'async' can decor\", \"ate either a method signature or an anonymous method literal to indicate it should run asynchronousl\", \"y, and 'await' tells the compiler to generate the code necessary to hold things in place until the a\", \"synchronous code completes. (Essentially, these are language-level implementations of 'promises,' wh\", \"ich are permeating the JavaScript world and slowly starting to gather steam in the Java world as wel\", \"l, under the name 'CompletableFuture' out of the java.util.concurrent package in Java8.)\\n\\n```\\nasync \", \"Task PlaySongsAsync(int[] ids) { foreach (var id in ids) { try { var data = await service.GetEncoded\", \"DataAsync(id); var song = await Task.Run(() => Decode(data)); await PlayAsync(song); } catch (Except\", \"ion e) { /* just skip the song */ } } }\\n```\\n\\nThere is much, much more we can discuss with respect to\", \" C#, but then we'd have no time to talk about anything else, and there is much, much more to go over\", \" on our tour. Fortunately, Microsoft has a great collection of web resources on the language, starti\", \"ng with a page that lists an overall history of the language, available at https://aka.ms/csharpwhat\", \"snew, and a general (if abbreviated) overview of the language available at https://aka.ms/csharptour\", \".

ASP.NET MVC was rebranded (and refactored) to be\", \" 'ASP.NET Core MVC' in 2015, in keeping with the '.NET Core' naming for the cross-platform runtime, \", \"and has made some conceptual shifts as new frameworks-such as Ruby-on-Rails-gained popularity and cr\", \"eated some new patterns (such as routing tables).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n- ASP.NET MVC Web API: While the \", \"name certainly gets no points for brevity, it does accurately reflect the idea that this framework i\", \"s built off of the same concepts that underlie the ASP.NET MVC library, but with the intent of produ\", \"cing JSON data instead of HTML. When ASP.NET MVC was tagged with the 'Core' moniker, the 'MVC' was f\", \"ormally dropped from Web API projects, so that now they are simply 'ASP.NET Core Web API,' or more i\", \"nformally, 'Web API' projects.\\n\\nLet's have a look at a quick ASP.NET Core Web API application-the ub\", \"iquitous TODO list-and then we'll have a quick look at an MVC application before we look at Microsof\", \"t's data-storage framework, Entity Framework.\\n\\n## ASP.NET Core Web API\\n\\nTo get started with Core Web\", \" API, we first need to scaffold out the Web API template; this can be done either via 'File|New' in \", \"one of the Visual Studio IDEs, or from the command-line using the .NET Core CLI tools by executing '\", \"dotnet new webapi -o todoapi.' This will create a subdirectory called 'todoapi' and install the .NET\", \" Core Web API project inside of it. Out of the box, it scaffolds out a simple API that has one contr\", \"oller to hand back arbitrary 'value' objects, accessible at http://localhost:5000/api/values. Before\", \" we make any changes to the code, it's always good to make sure the scaffold is working, so execute \", \"a 'dotnet run' from within the 'todoapi' directory, and navigate to the given URL; the response shou\", \"ld be a dirt-simple JSON array containing two strings.\\n\\nA Web API project, like its cousin the MVC a\", \"pplication, is broken into models and controllers, with the 'view' assumed to be an automated conver\", \"sion from a model object into JSON. Thus, in a Web API project, the goal will be to accept incoming \", \"requests, perform the necessary business logic, and return the appropriate model type, usually corre\", \"sponding to the resource type in the URL, to be converted to JSON.\\n\\nThe Controllers directory contai\", \"ns the code for the ValuesController, which is the default-scaffolded code. It doesn't use any model\", \" objects, which means it's clearly inferior. Let's delete it, and replace it with something that's a\", \" little more 'MV'-like. That means, first of all, that we need a model object to represent a TODO it\", \"em, which is a pretty simple domain object:\\n\\n```\\npublic class Todo { public long ID { get; set; } pu\", \"blic string Description { get; set; } public bool Completed { get; set; } public Todo() { Completed \", \"= false; } }\\n```\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n(Note that it would be a bit irregular to call this a POJO, since \", \"it's not a Java object, but that's basically exactly what this is.

The Web API expectation is that a controller will be a c\", \"lass that has a number of public methods that obey some conventions, in terms of both method names a\", \"nd parameter sets, like Java has done with later versions of the Servlet and EJB specifications.\\n\\n``\", \"`\\n[Route(\\\"api/[controller]\\\")] public class TodosController : Controller { private List<Todo> todos =\", \" new List<Todo>() { new Todo() { ID=0, Description=\\\"Get milk\\\", Completed=true }, new Todo() { ID=1, \", \"Description=\\\"Get pet food\\\" }, new Todo() { ID=2, Description=\\\"Learn .NET Core\\\" }, new Todo() { ID=3,\", \" Description=\\\"Write billion-dollar app\\\" } }; // GET api/todos [HttpGet] public IEnumerable<Todo> Get\", \"() { return todos; } // GET api/todos/5 [HttpGet(\\\"{id}\\\")] public Todo Get(int id) { return todos.Fir\", \"st((t) => t.ID == id); } // POST api/todos [HttpPost] public void Post([FromBody]Todo value) { todos\", \".Add(value); }\\n```\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n```\\n// PUT api/todos/5 [HttpPut(\\\"{id}\\\")] public void Put(int id,\", \" [FromBody]Todo value) { var todo = todos.First((t) => t.ID == id); todo.Description = value.Descrip\", \"tion; todo.Completed = value.Completed; } // DELETE api/todos/5 [HttpDelete(\\\"{id}\\\")] public void Del\", \"ete(int id) { } }\\n```\\n\\nTo understand this class, it's important to understand a few things: First, t\", \"he square-bracketed declarations outside each method are what .NET calls 'custom attributes,' which,\", \" true story, figured prominently in the design for JSR-175 annotations. The attributes provide infor\", \"mation (via reflection, same way annotations do) about how HTTP verbs should match against the metho\", \"ds-so, for example, the ASP.NET runtime can know that the two Get() methods should both be invoked w\", \"hen an incoming GET request is made.\\n\\nThe other half of that binding, of course, is knowing the part\", \"ial URL pattern that should trigger the method. Notice that the controller class itself has an attri\", \"bute, 'Routing,' which contains the string 'api/[controller].' The square-bracketed 'controller' is \", \"to tell the ASP.NET runtime to use the name of the class, minus its '-Controller' suffix, so the URL\", \" pattern for all of these API endpoints is 'api/ todos.' From here, standard REST conventions kick i\", \"n-a GET to 'api/todos' should return all of the TODO items, so the Get() method taking no parameters\", \" and returning an IEnumerable&lt;Todo&gt; (think of it as a high-level iterator interface) is the ri\", \"ght one to invoke here. If, on the other hand, a caller wants a single TODO, they'll issue a request\", \" with a URL pattern of 'api/todos/' plus the ID of the TODO requested. The second Get() method indic\", \"ates that the URL pattern includes '{id},' so 'api/ todos/3' will extract '3' and pass it for the va\", \"lue of 'id' to the method. Ditto for the Put and Delete methods.\\n\\nThe full details of routing are in\", \" the ASP.NET documentation, but this should be sufficient to understand what's happening here. To se\", \"e the new controller in action, just do a 'dotnet run' from the 'todoapi' directory, and point an HT\", \"TP client (curl or Postman) at http://localhost:5000/api/todos to see the JSON representations hande\", \"d back.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## ASP.NET Core MVC\\n\\nHTTP-based APIs are nice, but when we need a tradition\", \"al server-side rendered application, ASP.NET provides a traditional MVC framework called (not surpri\", \"singly) ASP.NET Core MVC.

One way to do this is to use a custom attrib\", \"ute, or the EF Fluent API can indicate that the blog metadata class should be ignored using the 'OnM\", \"odelCreating' method, invoked when the database schema is created.\\n\\n```\\npublic class BloggingContext\", \" : DbContext { public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; } protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelB\", \"uilder modelBuilder) { modelBuilder.Ignore<BlogMetadata>(); } } public class Blog { public int BlogI\", \"d { get; set; } public string Url { get; set; } public List<Post> Posts { get; set; } public BlogMet\", \"adata Metadata { get; set; } } public class Post { public int PostId { get; set; } public string Tit\", \"le { get; set; } public string Content { get; set; } public Blog Blog { get; set; } } public class B\", \"logMetadata { public DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; } }\\n```\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nThe 'Id' field\", \"s, of course, are typically primary key integer columns in the database, and the List of Posts is a \", \"classic one-to-many relationship. All of this will be eminently familiar to any user of Hibernate, J\", \"PA, or other object-relational modeling system. What will be different will be the way in which quer\", \"ies and modifiers are run; thanks to LINQ, Entity Framework uses an entirely new style of query star\", \"ting from the DbSet fields modeled on the DbContext-inheriting class. To do a query to fetch all the\", \" blogs from the system, we simply create an instance of the context inside of a 'using' block (which\", \" is the inspiration for the try-with-resources block in Java7), and use that instance to obtain the \", \"set of Blog instances and iterate through them:\\n\\n```\\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext()) { f\", \"oreach (var blog in context.Blogs) { // do something with the blog } }\\n```\\n\\nContrary to what we expe\", \"rienced during the heyday of EJB Entity Beans, however, this isn't a case of early loading or late l\", \"oading; under the hood, Entity Framework is making use of 'enumerator objects' (very similar to Java\", \"8 streams and the Java Iterable&lt;T&gt; interface) to fetch objects in batches, just as a typical d\", \"atabase cursor would do.\\n\\nIn the Java world, however, filtering that list of blogs to include only t\", \"hose that have 'dotnet' in the URL presented problems-either the filtering happens on the database s\", \"ide, in which case the query has to be translated to SQL, or the filtering happens on the client sid\", \"e, which means the entire collection has to be brought over the network. With LINQ, however, this lo\", \"oks like this:\\n\\n```\\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext()) { foreach (var blog in context.Blogs\", \" .Where(b => b.Url.Contains(\\\"dotnet\\\"))) { // do something with the blog } }\\n```\\n\\nBut this has the sa\", \"me drawbacks as before; instead, we can use an 'expression tree,' a feature of LINQ that compiles in\", \"to a runtime structure that reflects the compiled code:\\n\\n```\\nusing (var context = new BloggingContex\", \"t()) { var allDotnetBlogUrls = from blog in context.Blogs where blog.Url.Contains(\\\"dotnet\\\") select b\", \"log.Url;\\n```\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n```\\nforeach (var url in allDotnetBlogUrls) { // do something with the \", \"blog URL // note we don't have the entire Blog, just the Url } }\\n```\\n\\nThis 'from-where-select' synta\", \"x that looks so much like SQL isn't; it's a syntax that's designed to look similar to SQL and offer \", \"many of the same kinds of operators and options. However, this isn't an SQL query-it will not be sen\", \"t to the database. Instead, the expression tree is analyzed-and optimizedby the EF plumbing to gener\", \"ate an efficient SQL statement, on a driver-by-driver basis. This means that the query filters and r\", \"estrictions are analyzed on the client side, but sent to the database to be executed-for example, th\", \"e above turns into a 'SELECT url FROM blog WHERE\\u2026' using whatever primitives to do a string-containm\", \"ent check that the database and EF provider offers. This is really the best-of-both-worlds scenario.\", \" Couple that with the compile-time type checking that the C# compiler provides against the model obj\", \"ects, and you have a solution that is entirely new to the Java world. (Not impossible to provide, mi\", \"nd you, but still something the Java world currently lacks.)\\n\\nUpdates and modifications entail makin\", \"g modifications on the model object, and those changes will be sent to the database when the context\", \" object goes out of the using block's scope. To add a new blog, construct the object and add it to t\", \"he DbSet on the context object; to remove it, use the context's DbSet again. And should you really, \", \"really want to write raw SQL, the context object provides that capacity.\\n\\nThere is, of course, much \", \"more to discuss about Entity Framework-it's every bit as rich and powerful as JPA, and as such, defi\", \"nitely larger than just what we can cover in a single paper.
