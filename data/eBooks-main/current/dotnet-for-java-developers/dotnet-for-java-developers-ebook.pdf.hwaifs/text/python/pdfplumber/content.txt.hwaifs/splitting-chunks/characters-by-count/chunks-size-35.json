It was\\ncalled .NET, i\", \"t would be the backbone for their upcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would\\nbe a part of t\", \"heir data management system (nicknamed \\u201cSQLServer.NET\\u201d), and it would form the\\ncore development plat\", \"form for building interconnected applications into the future by leveraging\\nemerging standards such \", \"as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few others the world had not yet really come to\\nunderstand. It would be th\", \"e principal competitor platform to their principal development rival at the\\ntime, Sun Microsystems, \", \"and its Java platform.

Much effort was wasted due to the\\nentanglement of \\u201c.NET\\u201d with \\u201cweb se\", \"rvices,\\u201d and it would take the better part of a decade before\\npeople could understand that the two r\", \"eally had nothing intrinsically to do with one another any\\nmore than \\u201cPerl\\u201d did with \\u201cdatabases.\\u201d Mi\", \"crosoft management compounded all this confusion by\\nre-branding the \\u201c.NET\\u201d suffix to a number of the\", \"ir products, which they later corrected but well after\\nthe damage had been done.\\nBut despite all tha\", \"t, solid engineering rests at the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made\\nit harder to se\", \"e, but it\\u2019s always been there.

They integrated\\ndirectly with the hardware, making use of the facilities \", \"there to obtain memory, interact with the\\ndisk, and present data to the display for the user to unde\", \"rstand. In time, we as an industry found that\\nthis direct-hardware interaction had its drawbacks, an\", \"d we sought to create a series of abstractions\\non top of that hardware, to help coordinate the use o\", \"f the hardware across multiple simultaneously\\n.NET for Java Developers 3executing programs. We calle\", \"d that first attempt at regulating and managing the hardware an\\noperating system. And it was pretty \", \"good. So good, in fact, that numerous flavors of operating\\nsystem were born, including Microsoft\\u2019s W\", \"indows operating system, and Solaris, and macOS (though\\nit was called \\u201cSystem 7\\u201d back then), and Lin\", \"ux, and a few others whose names exist now only in the\\nhistory books and dusty corners of Usenet for\", \"ums.

If you\\never ran DOS, though, it just means you\\u2019re old.)\\nThe\", \" bigger, more important issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system\\nitse\", \"lf\\u2014that programmers found it helpful and useful to have \\u201csomething else\\u201d working with their\\nprograms\", \". That \\u201csomething else\\u201d would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs\\nexecuted and be\", \"haved, rather than assuming that every single nuance had to be the programmers\\u2019\\nresponsibility.\\nThis\", \" concept, in large, is essentially that of a \\u201cmanaged environment.\\u201d Although it has its roots\\nin ope\", \"rating systems, it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of\\ncontainers \", \"and cloud: that there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are\\nresponsible\", \" for details that the programmer doesn\\u2019t want to have to deal with. Operating systems\\nare managed en\", \"vironments in that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to\\nschedule the exe\", \"cution of threads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network\\nports or data fil\", \"es. Virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in\\nthat they regulate\", \" the access and reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode\\nformat into CPU-nativ\", \"e instructions, and prevent the direct access of memory (except under very\\nspecific circumstances) i\", \"n order to avoid process termination by careless programming. Containers\\nsuch as Docker are managed \", \"environments in that they provide a context around an executable\\nto mimic a precise environment\\u2014conf\", \"iguration files, environment variables, and shared network\\nsettings\\u2014so that developers can be assure\", \"d that the environment outside their programs are\\nconsistent regardless of where they are deployed.\\n\", \"By the early \\u201990s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for\\nWindows d\", \"evelopers to be able to take \\u201cthe next step forward\\u201d in development evolution. The \\u201cGUI\\nrevolution\\u201d \", \"of the mid-\\u201980s was largely finished; programs weren\\u2019t just about \\u201cdialogs and data,\\u201d\\nbut now needed\", \" to integrate more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for\\nexample) and star\", \"t taking advantage of networking in greater detail. (Old developers like me will\\nremember that it wa\", \"s around 1995 that references to HTTP and \\u201cthe World Wide Web\\u201d were just\\nstarting to appear in publi\", \"cations and technology journals.)\\nAs is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges \", \"emerged. C++ developers\\nhad been speaking of \\u201creusable code\\u201d for several years, but it was Visual Ba\", \"sic (and Delphi, along with\\nseveral other \\u201c4GL\\u201d variants) that demonstrated actual practical code re\", \"use, in the form of \\u201ccontrols\\u201d:\\nwidgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly w\", \"ithout requiring in-depth\\nknowledge about the controls\\u2019 implementation. Simply obtain the library, p\", \"ut it into the right place\\nwithin the development environment, drag-and-drop the control into the co\", \"nstruction area, and lo,\\nthe developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of \\u201cap\", \"plication frameworks,\\u201d\\nlike MFC and OWL, but \\u201cGUI builders\\u201d had demonstrated that the concept of \\u201cco\", \"ntrols\\u201d could be\\nleveraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and\", \" events; now\\n.NET for Java Developers 4Microsoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the\", \" bigger world beyond GUI development.\\nMore importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship\", \"\\u2014make it possible for outside\\ndevelopers to build \\u201cthings\\u201d that could be used by existing things (su\", \"ch as the operating system or,\\nperhaps, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their impleme\", \"ntation.\\nTo do that, they needed to create a managed environment that would work across a variety of\", \"\\ndifferent languages, but all operating under the same rules. That effort, called the Component\\nObje\", \"ct Model (COM), was the first of several \\u201cmanaged platforms\\u201d that emerged during the early-\\nand mid-\", \"\\u201990s. (Ironically, several open-source efforts would go after this same space many years\\nafter Micro\", \"soft declared COM \\u201cfinished,\\u201d including Mozilla\\u2019s XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in\\nthat it becam\", \"e the backbone of Windows development for a significant percentage of the Windows\\nplatform. But it s\", \"till failed in that it left programs vulnerable to many of the same things that had\\nplagued them bef\", \"ore: memory leaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpected process termination at\\nthe first mistake. It \", \"was clear that, despite the managed platform, writing code in a \\u201cnative\\u201d language\\n(such as C/C++ or \", \"Delphi) still wasn\\u2019t a particularly great place to be.\\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that\", \" Sun Microsystems demonstrated the HotJava browser\\nto the world, the centerpiece of which was this l\", \"anguage that could be used to write executable\\nbits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft ha\", \"d come to the realization that this was what it\\nwas missing: a \\u201cmanaged language\\u201d to run on top of t\", \"heir managed platform. A managed language\\nhad exactly the right \\u201cdistance\\u201d from the underlying opera\", \"ting system they were seeking\\u2014garbage\\ncollection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental cras\", \"hes, and the virtual machine could\\nhelp enforce stronger security controls that the world had just s\", \"tarted to realize they needed.

C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and the\\nunderlying runtime wa\", \"s given the name the \\u201cCommon Language Infrastructure\\u201d (CLI), and accepted\\nand ratified as ECMA-335. \", \"Intel, HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in\\nkeeping these specifications \", \"up to date with changes to the language and the platform, the most\\nrecent updates3 coming in 2012 fo\", \"r the CLI and 2017 for C#.\\nWith the introduction of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpected \", \"side-effect: members of\\nthe open-source community began to examine building a \\u201cclean-room\\u201d implement\", \"ation of them.\\nWhile the CLI Specification didn\\u2019t include any of the Windows-specific features (such\", \" as a deep COM\\nintegration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution for \", \"their existing\\ndeveloper base, the CLI Specification itself provided enough integration points to ma\", \"ke it interesting\\nto implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one such pr\", \"oject, calling\\nit Mono.\\nThe specification also gave Microsoft some room to do what some within the c\", \"ompany had been\\nlooking to do for quite a while: provide a research and experimentation vehicle for \", \"the academic and\\nresearch communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripped-down versio\", \"n of the CLR\\nsource code, code-named \\u201cRotor,\\u201d distributed under an open-source license they created,\", \" called the\\n2 ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification for the language commonly known \", \"as \\u201cJavaScript,\\u201d but is\\nmore rightly called \\u201cECMAScript,\\u201d governed as ECMA-262.\\n3 CLI: https://www.i\", \"so.org/standard/58046.html and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/\\nEcma-335.ht\", \"m; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm\\n.NET for Java Developer\", \"s 6\\u201cShared Source\\u201d license, giving it the formal name \\u201cShared Source CLI\\u201d or \\u201cSSCLI.\\u201d While Mono wou\", \"ld\\nremain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, and Rotor of even less inter\", \"est to\\nthose outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source mindset were sown.

Microsoft then shifted\\nto a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012, V\", \"isual Studio 2015, and most\\nrecently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the versions of C# and the CLR st\", \"arted falling out of lockstep\\nwith Visual Studio, deliberately, for a couple of reasons.\\nThe first w\", \"as that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, and was starting to\\nunbundle \", \"its various parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independent, parts. F#, which\\nfirst sh\", \"ipped \\u201cout of the box\\u201d in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to start down the open-\\nsource \", \"path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project, it had never really\\nembra\", \"ced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place.

In particular, the\\ngaming toolkit Unity had ex\", \"pressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running\\ninside the Unity toolkit. Unity-ba\", \"sed games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the\\nJavaScript-on-.NET implementatio\", \"n that Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a Python-\\ninspired .NET language called Boo. Ad\", \"ditionally, the open-source community produced another .NET\\nimplementation, the .NET Micro Framework\", \", specifically aimed at embedded software systems and\\nsmall-scale hardware such as the Arduino platf\", \"orm.\\nAll of this, however, was the calm before the storm.
