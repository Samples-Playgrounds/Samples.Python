It was our first \\ntrip out of the country, and aside\", \" from the ridiculously long flight\\u2014eight hours on an airplane feels like forever to somebody who has\", \"n\\u2019t yet finished their first decade of life\\u2014I really had no idea of what to expect. In fact, in an a\", \"musing anecdote my father has yet to tire of telling, I remember having to sit down with my parents \", \"in front of a globe so that they could explain to me that \\u201cthe United States\\u201d was not, in fact, syno\", \"nymous with \\u201cthe world.\\u201d\\nIt was entirely a trip of firsts: my first experience wandering around in a\", \" world where I couldn\\u2019t \\nunderstand any of the written signs, my first experience eating food I coul\", \"dn\\u2019t recognize, and my first experience feeling completely lost in the world around me. I found, to \", \"my eight-year-old horror, that I couldn\\u2019t even figure out which bathroom to use\\u2014which, considering I\", \" had just the year before managed to convince my mother I didn\\u2019t need to be escorted to the bathroom\", \" and back, was of particular concern. I didn\\u2019t want her to start thinking I actually needed adult su\", \"pervision. This was clearly not my home, and I was more than a little terrified of it.\\nVisiting a fo\", \"reign land, particularly to someone who has cocooned themselves entirely in the \\nconcepts and cultur\", \"es of \\u201chome,\\u201d can be intimidating and overwhelming without a guide. On that trip to France I had my \", \"parents, and despite neither of them speaking anything close to fluent French, they managed to guide\", \" us through the tricky parts. (French-English guidebooks are a wonderful thing.) \\nFor the typical Ja\", \"va developer, finding a guide to exploring the .NET ecosystem can be tricky, since \\nthe average Java\", \" developer can still hearken back to a time when expressing an interest in looking at .NET was tanta\", \"mount to declaring a desire to betray everything good and right in the world (or so it seemed, at le\", \"ast at the time).\\nIn this paper, I will serve as your guide to the .NET world. I\\u2019ve been a part of t\", \"he .NET ecosystem \\nalmost as long as I\\u2019ve been a part of Java\\u2019s. I started with Java in 1996; I star\", \"ted with what would become .NET in 2000, even before it was announced. I\\u2019ve built applications in bo\", \"th, written books for both, and explored the source for both. They\\u2019re closer to one another than you\", \" might think, but each has been fundamentally influenced by the people using them. In fact, it\\u2019s not\", \" a bad analogy to think of them as twin brothers, separated at birth, raised by different sets of pa\", \"rents. Same DNA, but shaped by their experiences and events to be different in a number of interesti\", \"ng places.\\nIf you\\u2019re a Java developer, looking to get started exploring the .NET ecosystem, then sus\", \"pend what \\nyou think you know, take my hand, and let\\u2019s take a trip to a foreign land. Doing so will \", \"require a little history to understand how things came to be, then a quick set of instructions on ho\", \"w to get the tooling set up (and which tooling you want, depending on your preferences). Once the en\", \"vironment is set up, we can pick up the critical differences between C# and Java, and start diving i\", \"nto some of the central frameworks in this world\\u2014ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and a few others. When w\", \"e .NET for Java Developers   2\\nfinish up, if you\\u2019re following along, you\\u2019ll have everything you need\", \" to start your own exploration of \\nthe .NET community, and from there you\\u2019ll get to draw your own co\", \"nclusions and make your own opinions.\\nMost importantly, you\\u2019ll know how to order off the menu and te\", \"ll the bathrooms apart. Ready?.NET for Java Developers  3\\nHistory\\nIf you\\u2019d like to skip the walk dow\", \"n memory lane, you can jump to the next section, Getting Started .\\nOstensibly, the history of .NET b\", \"egins in October of 2000, at Microsoft\\u2019s Professional Developer \\nConference (PDC), when Microsoft an\", \"nounced to the world that they were working on a new programming platform, on which would rest the f\", \"ate of all Microsoft development to follow. It was called .NET, it would be the backbone for their u\", \"pcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would be a part of their data management system (nickna\", \"med \\u201cSQLServer.NET\\u201d), and it would form the core development platform for building interconnected ap\", \"plications into the future by leveraging emerging standards such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few other\", \"s the world had not yet really come to understand. It would be the principal competitor platform to \", \"their principal development rival at the time, Sun Microsystems, and its Java platform. And the worl\", \"d could see that the shot was fired, the line in the sand drawn, and the armies drawn up; clearly, t\", \"his was Microsoft copying the efforts of its competitors, seeking dominance, and\\u2026.\\nAnd most of the w\", \"orld completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it had come to \\nexist, and what Microsof\", \"t really sought to obtain from it.\\nIn fact, it\\u2019s fair to suggest that many within the Microsoft ecos\", \"ystem misunderstood what .NET was \\nreally about; once announced, the marketing machine took over. Mu\", \"ch effort was wasted due to the entanglement of \\u201c.NET\\u201d with \\u201cweb services,\\u201d and it would take the be\", \"tter part of a decade before people could understand that the two really had nothing intrinsically t\", \"o do with one another any more than \\u201cPerl\\u201d did with \\u201cdatabases.\\u201d Microsoft management compounded all\", \" this confusion by re-branding the \\u201c.NET\\u201d suffix to a number of their products, which they later cor\", \"rected but well after \\nthe damage had been done.\\nBut despite all that, solid engineering rests at th\", \"e core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made \\nit harder to see, but it\\u2019s always been there. \", \"To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its proper historical context: that, in trut\", \"h, it was the simple \\u201cnext step\\u201d along an evolutionary chain that stretched back much further than t\", \"hat October keynote almost two decades ago.\\nOf components, managed environments, and code\\nIn the beg\", \"inning, there was C.\\nTo be more accurate about it, in the beginning a number of programming language\", \"s were created \\nto make it easier to produce programs that knew how to execute on a single chip. The\", \"y integrated directly with the hardware, making use of the facilities there to obtain memory, intera\", \"ct with the disk, and present data to the display for the user to understand. In time, we as an indu\", \"stry found that this direct-hardware interaction had its drawbacks, and we sought to create a series\", \" of abstractions on top of that hardware, to help coordinate the use of the hardware across multiple\", \" simultaneously .NET for Java Developers    4\\nexecuting programs. We called that first attempt at re\", \"gulating and managing the hardware an \\noperating system. And it was pretty good. So good, in fact, t\", \"hat numerous flavors of operating system were born, including Microsoft\\u2019s Windows operating system, \", \"and Solaris, and macOS (though it was called \\u201cSystem 7\\u201d back then), and Linux, and a few others whos\", \"e names exist now only in the history books and dusty corners of Usenet forums. (Bonus points if you\", \" recognize these names: Minix, Mach, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even more bonus points if you ever r\", \"an one of them. If you ever ran DOS, though, it just means you\\u2019re old.)\\nThe bigger, more important i\", \"ssue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system \\nitself\\u2014that programmers foun\", \"d it helpful and useful to have \\u201csomething else\\u201d working with their programs. That \\u201csomething else\\u201d \", \"would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs executed and behaved, rather than assum\", \"ing that every single nuance had to be the programmers\\u2019 responsibility. \\nThis concept, in large, is \", \"essentially that of a \\u201cmanaged environment.\\u201d Although it has its roots \\nin operating systems, it ech\", \"oes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of containers and cloud: that there \", \"can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are responsible for details that the \", \"programmer doesn\\u2019t want to have to deal with. Operating systems are managed environments in that the\", \"y take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to schedule the execution of threads, and\", \" how to regulate access to various resources such as network ports or data files. Virtual machines s\", \"uch as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in that they regulate the access and reclam\", \"ation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode format into CPU-native instructions, and pr\", \"event the direct access of memory (except under very specific circumstances) in order to avoid proce\", \"ss termination by careless programming. Containers such as Docker are managed environments in that t\", \"hey provide a context around an executable to mimic a precise environment\\u2014configuration files, envir\", \"onment variables, and shared network settings\\u2014so that developers can be assured that the environment\", \" outside their programs are consistent regardless of where they are deployed. \\nBy the early \\u201990s, Mi\", \"crosoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for \\nWindows developers to be able\", \" to take \\u201cthe next step forward\\u201d in development evolution. The \\u201cGUI revolution\\u201d of the mid-\\u201980s was \", \"largely finished; programs weren\\u2019t just about \\u201cdialogs and data,\\u201d but now needed to integrate more d\", \"eeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for example) and start taking advantage o\", \"f networking in greater detail. (Old developers like me will remember that it was around 1995 that r\", \"eferences to HTTP and \\u201cthe World Wide Web\\u201d were just starting to appear in publications and technolo\", \"gy journals.)\\nAs is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges emerged. C++ develop\", \"ers \\nhad been speaking of \\u201creusable code\\u201d for several years, but it was Visual Basic (and Delphi, al\", \"ong with several other \\u201c4GL\\u201d variants) that demonstrated actual practical code reuse, in the form of\", \" \\u201ccontrols\\u201d: widgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly without requiring in\", \"-depth knowledge about the controls\\u2019 implementation. Simply obtain the library, put it into the righ\", \"t place within the development environment, drag-and-drop the control into the construction area, an\", \"d lo, the developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of \\u201capplication framework\", \"s,\\u201d like MFC and OWL, but \\u201cGUI builders\\u201d had demonstrated that the concept of \\u201ccontrols\\u201d could be le\", \"veraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and events; now .NET f\", \"or Java Developers    5\\nMicrosoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the bigger world b\", \"eyond GUI development. \\nMore importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship\\u2014make it possi\", \"ble for outside developers to build \\u201cthings\\u201d that could be used by existing things (such as the oper\", \"ating system or, perhaps, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their implementation.\\nTo do\", \" that, they needed to create a managed environment that would work across a variety of \\ndifferent la\", \"nguages, but all operating under the same rules. That effort, called the Component Object Model (COM\", \"), was the first of several \\u201cmanaged platforms\\u201d that emerged during the early- and mid-\\u201990s. (Ironic\", \"ally, several open-source efforts would go after this same space many years after Microsoft declared\", \" COM \\u201cfinished,\\u201d including Mozilla\\u2019s XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in that it became the backbon\", \"e of Windows development for a significant percentage of the Windows platform. But it still failed i\", \"n that it left programs vulnerable to many of the same things that had plagued them before: memory l\", \"eaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpected process termination at the first mistake. It was clear tha\", \"t, despite the managed platform, writing code in a \\u201cnative\\u201d language (such as C/C++ or Delphi) still\", \" wasn\\u2019t a particularly great place to be.\\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that Sun Microsys\", \"tems demonstrated the HotJava browser \\nto the world, the centerpiece of which was this language that\", \" could be used to write executable bits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft had come to th\", \"e realization that this was what it was missing: a \\u201cmanaged language\\u201d to run on top of their managed\", \" platform. A managed language had exactly the right \\u201cdistance\\u201d from the underlying operating system \", \"they were seeking\\u2014garbage collection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashes, and the\", \" virtual machine could help enforce stronger security controls that the world had just started to re\", \"alize they needed. It was, in many ways, a perfect match. Microsoft invested resources into building\", \" their own JVM, extended their IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrated COM int\", \"o the runtime.\\nUnfortunately, in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own destruction\", \".\\nHello, .NET\\nDivorces are never a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one is always fraught\", \" with opinion, \\nrevisionist history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997/1998, two facts\", \" were becoming clear: one, Sun didn\\u2019t care for Microsoft\\u2019s work increasing interoperability between \", \"their JVM and native COM components in Windows\\n1, and two, Microsoft and Java were going to part way\", \"s, one way or \\nanother. (Who got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)\\nEither certain groups w\", \"ithin Microsoft could see the writing on the wall or they had come to find \\nissues (real or perceive\", \"d) with the Java Virtual Machine; either way, by 1998, a new effort came to life inside of Microsoft\", \", designed to bring a new managed platform and managed language into the world. Originally intended \", \"as the successor to COM, it went through a variety of names, including \\n1 For the curious, Microsoft\", \" offered additional platform-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with native \\nCOM components\", \". The irony of this is deep, considering that Sun had actually allowed for COM-specific \\nnative inte\", \"rfaces in their JNI specification\\u2014the first three methods in the interface table for a JNIEnv (\\u201cJNI \", \"\\nenvironment\\u201d) object were specifically left \\u201creserved\\u201d for the necessary three methods (AddRef, Rel\", \"ease, and QueryInterface) of every COM interface object. Those three slots are still reserved to thi\", \"s day..NET for Java Developers    6\\n\\u201cCOM+,\\u201d the \\u201cComponent Object Runtime\\u201d (COR), the \\u201cUniversal Run\", \"Time\\u201d (URT), and \\u201cNext-\\nGeneration Windows Services\\u201d (NGWS) before finally being introduced to the w\", \"orld as \\u201c.NET\\u201d at that October 2000 PDC. Along with it would come a new language, code-named \\u201cCOOL\\u201d \", \"(supposedly to stand for the \\u201cComponent-Oriented Object Language,\\u201d although opinions vary now) and l\", \"ater renamed \\u201cC#.\\u201d\\nWhile most observers considered C# and the CLR (the Common Language Runtime, the \", \"virtual \\nmachine executing the bytecode) to be direct competitors of Java, Microsoft took careful st\", \"eps to ensure that it was \\u201copen\\u201d in ways that Java was not: where the JVM was designed from the begi\", \"nning to be a virtual machine for a single language, the CLR embraced a more polyglot approach, with\", \" Microsoft even going so far as to recruit several universities and companies to create new language\", \"s for this platform and/or adapt existing ones. This project, nicknamed \\u201cProject 7\\u201d (for the 7 group\", \"s that participated), debuted several of these languages during .NET\\u2019s introduction, and included CL\", \"R flavors of Eiffel, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of these languages gained any traction after the f\", \"irst few years of existence, and most no longer exist, but their presence had the effect on Microsof\", \"t of \\u201ckeeping them honest\\u201d with respect to other languages beyond C# and Visual Basic as the platfor\", \"m grew and evolved. (Microsoft itself would later go on to introduce a number of new CLR-based langu\", \"ages, including a compiled-to-binary version of ECMAScript, two different efforts at bringing manage\", \"d coding to C++, a hybrid object/functional language called F#, and several more research languages.\", \")\\nHowever, Microsoft also sought to make sure that .NET was not a proprietary effort by investing \\nt\", \"housands of man-hours into the creation of a series of international specifications\\u2014through the Euro\", \"pean Computer Manufacturer\\u2019s Association (ECMA\\n2)\\u2014to ensure that C# and the underlying \\nplatform wer\", \"e both open industry standards. C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and the underlying runtime\", \" was given the name the \\u201cCommon Language Infrastructure\\u201d (CLI), and accepted and ratified as ECMA-33\", \"5. Intel, HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in keeping these specificatio\", \"ns up to date with changes to the language and the platform, the most recent updates\\n3 coming in 201\", \"2 for the CLI and 2017 for C#.\\nWith the introduction of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpec\", \"ted side-effect: members of the open-source community began to examine building a \\u201cclean-room\\u201d imple\", \"mentation of them. While the CLI Specification didn\\u2019t include any of the Windows-specific features (\", \"such as a deep COM integration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution \", \"for their existing developer base, the CLI Specification itself provided enough integration points t\", \"o make it interesting to implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one suc\", \"h project, calling it Mono.\\nThe specification also gave Microsoft some room to do what some within t\", \"he company had been \\nlooking to do for quite a while: provide a research and experimentation vehicle\", \" for the academic and research communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripped-down v\", \"ersion of the CLR source code, code-named \\u201cRotor,\\u201d distributed under an open-source license they cre\", \"ated, called the \\n2 ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification for the language commonly \", \"known as \\u201cJavaScript,\\u201d but is \\nmore rightly called \\u201cECMAScript,\\u201d governed as ECMA-262.\\n3 CLI: https:\", \"//www.iso.org/standard/58046.html  and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/\\nEcm\", \"a-335.htm ; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm.NET for Java D\", \"evelopers    7\\n\\u201cShared Source\\u201d license, giving it the formal name \\u201cShared Source CLI\\u201d or \\u201cSSCLI.\\u201d Wh\", \"ile Mono would \\nremain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, and Rotor of ev\", \"en less interest to those outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source mindset were sown. \", \"Over time, Mono would be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own company, Xamarin, which wou\", \"ld faithfully parallel the work described by the specifications and periodically try out new ideas f\", \"or the open-source community to consider.\\nMicrosoft officially released the first version of C# and \", \"the CLR in 2002, and new versions came \\nroughly three years apart after that: C# 2.0 in 2005, and C#\", \" 3.0 in 2008. Each was contained in a product release of Visual Studio, such that C# 2.0 and version\", \" 2.0 of the CLR runtime was released with Visual Studio 2005, and C# 3.0 and CLR 3.5 came with Visua\", \"l Studio 2008. Microsoft then shifted to a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio 2010, Visual S\", \"tudio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, and most recently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the versions of C# a\", \"nd the CLR started falling out of lockstep with Visual Studio, deliberately, for a couple of reasons\", \".\\nThe first was that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, and was starting\", \" to \\nunbundle its various parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independent, parts. F#, \", \"which first shipped \\u201cout of the box\\u201d in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to start down the\", \" open-source path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project, it had never\", \" really embraced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place. Microsoft st\", \"arted working shortly thereafter on an open-source rewrite of its entire compiler toolchain, code-na\", \"med \\u201cRoslyn.\\u201d By the time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem were starting to s\", \"hip independently, with Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for developers to gather th\", \"e parts of the ecosystem they desired more easily. Open-source package management (called NuGet), wh\", \"ich began life well outside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated into Visual Studio s\", \"o that NuGet came \\u201cout of the box,\\u201d much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java IDEs.\\nMono, meanwhi\", \"le, had started to gain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular, the \\ngaming toolki\", \"t Unity had expressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running inside the Unity too\", \"lkit. Unity-based games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the JavaScript-on-.NET\", \" implementation that Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a Python-inspired .NET language c\", \"alled Boo. Additionally, the open-source community produced another .NET implementation, the .NET Mi\", \"cro Framework, specifically aimed at embedded software systems and small-scale hardware such as the \", \"Arduino platform.\\nAll of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, Microsoft announced \", \"that the source \\nfor ASP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to anyone who wanted t\", \"o look at it. It wasn\\u2019t full open-source yet, though, in that they weren\\u2019t accepting pull requests. \", \"It was, however, an important step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It announced that it\", \" would completely open-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making it available to any\", \" platform and accept pull requests from any developer so inclined. A new .NET implementation would b\", \"e completely open-source and hosted on GitHub, called .NET Core. It also announced the creation of t\", \"he .NET Foundation, an industry consortium of groups dedicated to the growth of the .NET platform, i\", \"n .NET for Java Developers    8\\nmuch the same fashion that the Java Community Process governs the co\", \"ntinued growth of the Java \\nplatform4.\\nTo be sure, Microsoft made some missteps along the way, and d\", \"efinitely learned a few hard lessons about its relationship with the open-source community, but by l\", \"ate 2017, Microsoft was statistically the biggest contributor on GitHub (measured in terms of total \", \"numbers of contributors\\n5), and all \\nof its key components\\u2014language, runtime, libraries, and many of\", \" its tools\\u2014were available for download on GitHub.\\nMicrosoft also started to get more serious about t\", \"he cross-platform/portability aspects of the .NET \\necosystem. Xamarin, which by 2009 had started pro\", \"ducing tools that could cross-compile .NET bytecode into native applications for iOS and Android pla\", \"tforms (the catchy-named \\u201cMonoDroid\\u201d and less-catchy \\u201cMono for iOS\\u201d toolkits), was flourishing, and \", \"Microsoft realized that a practical story for being able to share non-UI portions of code across mul\", \"tiple platforms was necessary if they wanted to avoid developer confusion.\\nWhile the ECMA Specificat\", \"ions had discussed different \\u201cprofiles\\u201d for levels of .NET standardization, \\nthese profiles were in \", \"many ways similar to their \\u201cJava Standard Edition,\\u201d \\u201cJava Micro Edition,\\u201d and \\u201cJava Enterprise Editi\", \"on\\u201d cousins\\u2014a little unwieldy in a number of ways, but most notably in that there wasn\\u2019t really a go\", \"od way to guarantee compatibility across platforms and implementation versions\\u2014if code is compiled b\", \"y the Java6 compiler, it is safe to assume that it will continue to run on the Java6 virtual machine\", \" from whence it was compiled, but the Java APIs do change from release to release, and this has trip\", \"ped up the unwary Java developer from time to time.\\nThus, in 2016, Microsoft announced the \\u201c.NET Sta\", \"ndard 1.0\\u201d profile, a collection not of relatively \\nvague implementation documents, but an actual AP\", \"I standard, such that a developer who sought to build a library that could be used by a variety of d\", \"ifferent platforms (across a certain number of versions of that platform, even) could know that anyt\", \"hing that implemented .NET Standard 1.0 would be able to consume that library, regardless of where t\", \"hat code is running\\u2014on a web server, on a mobile device, or even on somebody\\u2019s VR helmet (running a \", \"3D interactive application written with Unity).\\nWhich brings us, now, to the current day. \\n4 Ironica\", \"lly, Microsoft\\u2019s move to the .NET Foundation comes at the same time Oracle is looking to move \\naway \", \"from the JCP; both companies have experience with standards organizations, and neither wants to see \", \"\\ninnovation stifled in committee.\\n5 http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-open-source-2016\", \"-9.NET for Java Developers    9\\nHello, strange new world\\nTo the Java developer, this is a strange, s\", \"trange world compared to the one they glimpsed into back \\nin 2000.\\nFor starters, the Java world look\", \"s wildly different than it once did.
