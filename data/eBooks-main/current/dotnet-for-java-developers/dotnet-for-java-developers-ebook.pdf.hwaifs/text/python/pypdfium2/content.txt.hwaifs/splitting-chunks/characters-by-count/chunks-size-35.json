It was \\ncalled .NET, it would be the backbo\", \"ne for their upcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would \\nbe a part of their data management\", \" system (nicknamed \\u201cSQLServer.NET\\u201d), and it would form the \\ncore development platform for building i\", \"nterconnected applications into the future by leveraging \\nemerging standards such as XML, SOAP, WSDL\", \", and a few others the world had not yet really come to \\nunderstand. It would be the principal compe\", \"titor platform to their principal development rival at the \\ntime, Sun Microsystems, and its Java pla\", \"tform. And the world could see that the shot was fired, the \\nline in the sand drawn, and the armies \", \"drawn up; clearly, this was Microsoft copying the efforts of its \\ncompetitors, seeking dominance, an\", \"d\\u2026.\\nAnd most of the world completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it had come to \\nexi\", \"st, and what Microsoft really sought to obtain from it.\\nIn fact, it\\u2019s fair to suggest that many with\", \"in the Microsoft ecosystem misunderstood what .NET was \\nreally about; once announced, the marketing \", \"machine took over. Much effort was wasted due to the \\nentanglement of \\u201c.NET\\u201d with \\u201cweb services,\\u201d an\", \"d it would take the better part of a decade before \\npeople could understand that the two really had \", \"nothing intrinsically to do with one another any \\nmore than \\u201cPerl\\u201d did with \\u201cdatabases.\\u201d Microsoft m\", \"anagement compounded all this confusion by \\nre\\u2011branding the \\u201c.NET\\u201d suffix to a number of their produ\", \"cts, which they later corrected but well after \\nthe damage had been done.\\nBut despite all that, soli\", \"d engineering rests at the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made \\nit harder to see, but\", \" it\\u2019s always been there. To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its \\nproper histori\", \"cal context: that, in truth, it was the simple \\u201cnext step\\u201d along an evolutionary chain that \\nstretch\", \"ed back much further than that October keynote almost two decades ago.\\nOf components, managed enviro\", \"nments, and code\\nIn the beginning, there was C.\\nTo be more accurate about it, in the beginning a num\", \"ber of programming languages were created \\nto make it easier to produce programs that knew how to ex\", \"ecute on a single chip. They integrated \\ndirectly with the hardware, making use of the facilities th\", \"ere to obtain memory, interact with the \\ndisk, and present data to the display for the user to under\", \"stand. In time, we as an industry found that \\nthis direct-hardware interaction had its drawbacks, an\", \"d we sought to create a series of abstractions \\non top of that hardware, to help coordinate the use \", \"of the hardware across multiple simultaneously .NET for Java Developers 4\\nexecuting programs. We cal\", \"led that first attempt at regulating and managing the hardware an \\noperating system. And it was pret\", \"ty good. So good, in fact, that numerous flavors of operating \\nsystem were born, including Microsoft\", \"\\u2019s Windows operating system, and Solaris, and macOS (though \\nit was called \\u201cSystem 7\\u201d back then), an\", \"d Linux, and a few others whose names exist now only in the \\nhistory books and dusty corners of Usen\", \"et forums. (Bonus points if you recognize these names: \\nMinix, Mach, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even\", \" more bonus points if you ever ran one of them. If you \\never ran DOS, though, it just means you\\u2019re o\", \"ld.)\\nThe bigger, more important issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating sys\", \"tem \\nitself\\u2014that programmers found it helpful and useful to have \\u201csomething else\\u201d working with their\", \" \\nprograms. That \\u201csomething else\\u201d would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs \\nexec\", \"uted and behaved, rather than assuming that every single nuance had to be the programmers\\u2019 \\nresponsi\", \"bility. \\nThis concept, in large, is essentially that of a \\u201cmanaged environment.\\u201d Although it has its\", \" roots \\nin operating systems, it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era \", \"of \\ncontainers and cloud: that there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that \", \"are \\nresponsible for details that the programmer doesn\\u2019t want to have to deal with. Operating system\", \"s \\nare managed environments in that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to\", \" \\nschedule the execution of threads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network\", \" \\nports or data files. Virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in\", \" \\nthat they regulate the access and reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode \\n\", \"format into CPU-native instructions, and prevent the direct access of memory (except under very \\nspe\", \"cific circumstances) in order to avoid process termination by careless programming. Containers \\nsuch\", \" as Docker are managed environments in that they provide a context around an executable \\nto mimic a \", \"precise environment\\u2014configuration files, environment variables, and shared network \\nsettings\\u2014so that\", \" developers can be assured that the environment outside their programs are \\nconsistent regardless of\", \" where they are deployed. \\nBy the early \\u201990s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a manage\", \"d environment for \\nWindows developers to be able to take \\u201cthe next step forward\\u201d in development evol\", \"ution. The \\u201cGUI \\nrevolution\\u201d of the mid-\\u201980s was largely finished; programs weren\\u2019t just about \\u201cdial\", \"ogs and data,\\u201d \\nbut now needed to integrate more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click contex\", \"t menus, for \\nexample) and start taking advantage of networking in greater detail. (Old developers l\", \"ike me will \\nremember that it was around 1995 that references to HTTP and \\u201cthe World Wide Web\\u201d were \", \"just \\nstarting to appear in publications and technology journals.)\\nAs is common when developers mast\", \"er a new concept, new challenges emerged. C++ developers \\nhad been speaking of \\u201creusable code\\u201d for s\", \"everal years, but it was Visual Basic (and Delphi, along with \\nseveral other \\u201c4GL\\u201d variants) that de\", \"monstrated actual practical code reuse, in the form of \\u201ccontrols\\u201d: \\nwidgets that could be used acros\", \"s a variety of programs repeatedly without requiring in-depth \\nknowledge about the controls\\u2019 impleme\", \"ntation. Simply obtain the library, put it into the right place \\nwithin the development environment,\", \" drag-and-drop the control into the construction area, and lo, \\nthe developer was off and running. T\", \"rue, C++ had created the concept of \\u201capplication frameworks,\\u201d \\nlike MFC and OWL, but \\u201cGUI builders\\u201d \", \"had demonstrated that the concept of \\u201ccontrols\\u201d could be \\nleveraged to create a marketplace of reusa\", \"ble atomic blocks of state, behavior, and events; now .NET for Java Developers 5\\nMicrosoft wanted to\", \" bring that concept, writ larger, into the bigger world beyond GUI development. \\nMore importantly, t\", \"hey also wanted to invert that relationship\\u2014make it possible for outside \\ndevelopers to build \\u201cthing\", \"s\\u201d that could be used by existing things (such as the operating system or, \\nperhaps, the web browser\", \") without detailed knowledge of their implementation.\\nTo do that, they needed to create a managed en\", \"vironment that would work across a variety of \\ndifferent languages, but all operating under the same\", \" rules. That effort, called the Component \\nObject Model (COM), was the first of several \\u201cmanaged pla\", \"tforms\\u201d that emerged during the early\\u0002and mid-\\u201990s. (Ironically, several open-source efforts would g\", \"o after this same space many years \\nafter Microsoft declared COM \\u201cfinished,\\u201d including Mozilla\\u2019s XPC\", \"OM.) COM itself was successful in \\nthat it became the backbone of Windows development for a signific\", \"ant percentage of the Windows \\nplatform. But it still failed in that it left programs vulnerable to \", \"many of the same things that had \\nplagued them before: memory leaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpe\", \"cted process termination at \\nthe first mistake. It was clear that, despite the managed platform, wri\", \"ting code in a \\u201cnative\\u201d language \\n(such as C/C++ or Delphi) still wasn\\u2019t a particularly great place \", \"to be.\\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that Sun Microsystems demonstrated the HotJava brows\", \"er \\nto the world, the centerpiece of which was this language that could be used to write executable \", \"\\nbits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft had come to the realization that this was what i\", \"t \\nwas missing: a \\u201cmanaged language\\u201d to run on top of their managed platform. A managed language \\nha\", \"d exactly the right \\u201cdistance\\u201d from the underlying operating system they were seeking\\u2014garbage \\ncolle\", \"ction would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashes, and the virtual machine could \\nhelp en\", \"force stronger security controls that the world had just started to realize they needed. It was, \\nin\", \" many ways, a perfect match. Microsoft invested resources into building their own JVM, extended \\nthe\", \"ir IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrated COM into the runtime.\\nUnfortunately\", \", in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own destruction.\\nHello, .NET\\nDivorces are n\", \"ever a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one is always fraught with opinion, \\nrevisionist \", \"history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997/1998, two facts were becoming clear: \\none, \", \"Sun didn\\u2019t care for Microsoft\\u2019s work increasing interoperability between their JVM and native \\nCOM c\", \"omponents in Windows1\\n, and two, Microsoft and Java were going to part ways, one way or \\nanother. (W\", \"ho got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)\\nEither certain groups within Microsoft could see \", \"the writing on the wall or they had come to find \\nissues (real or perceived) with the Java Virtual M\", \"achine; either way, by 1998, a new effort came to \\nlife inside of Microsoft, designed to bring a new\", \" managed platform and managed language into the \\nworld. Originally intended as the successor to COM,\", \" it went through a variety of names, including \\n1 For the curious, Microsoft offered additional plat\", \"form-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with native \\nCOM components.

Along with it would come a new language, code-named \\u201cCOOL\\u201d (supposedly \\nto stand for \", \"the \\u201cComponent-Oriented Object Language,\\u201d although opinions vary now) and later \\nrenamed \\u201cC#.\\u201d\\nWhile\", \" most observers considered C# and the CLR (the Common Language Runtime, the virtual \\nmachine executi\", \"ng the bytecode) to be direct competitors of Java, Microsoft took careful steps to \\nensure that it w\", \"as \\u201copen\\u201d in ways that Java was not: where the JVM was designed from the beginning \\nto be a virtual \", \"machine for a single language, the CLR embraced a more polyglot approach, with \\nMicrosoft even going\", \" so far as to recruit several universities and companies to create new languages \\nfor this platform \", \"and/or adapt existing ones. This project, nicknamed \\u201cProject 7\\u201d (for the 7 groups \\nthat participated\", \"), debuted several of these languages during .NET\\u2019s introduction, and included CLR \\nflavors of Eiffe\", \"l, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of these languages gained any traction after the first \\nfew years of\", \" existence, and most no longer exist, but their presence had the effect on Microsoft of \\n\\u201ckeeping th\", \"em honest\\u201d with respect to other languages beyond C# and Visual Basic as the platform \\ngrew and evol\", \"ved. (Microsoft itself would later go on to introduce a number of new CLR-based \\nlanguages, includin\", \"g a compiled-to-binary version of ECMAScript, two different efforts at bringing \\nmanaged coding to C\", \"++, a hybrid object/functional language called F#, and several more research \\nlanguages.)\\nHowever, M\", \"icrosoft also sought to make sure that .NET was not a proprietary effort by investing \\nthousands of \", \"man-hours into the creation of a series of international specifications\\u2014through the \\nEuropean Comput\", \"er Manufacturer\\u2019s Association (ECMA2)\\u2014to ensure that C# and the underlying \\nplatform were both open \", \"industry standards. C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and the \\nunderlying runtime was given \", \"the name the \\u201cCommon Language Infrastructure\\u201d (CLI), and accepted \\nand ratified as ECMA-335. Intel, \", \"HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in \\nkeeping these specifications up to \", \"date with changes to the language and the platform, the most \\nrecent updates3 coming in 2012 for the\", \" CLI and 2017 for C#.\\nWith the introduction of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpected side-\", \"effect: members of \\nthe open-source community began to examine building a \\u201cclean-room\\u201d implementatio\", \"n of them. \\nWhile the CLI Specification didn\\u2019t include any of the Windows-specific features (such as\", \" a deep COM \\nintegration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution for th\", \"eir existing \\ndeveloper base, the CLI Specification itself provided enough integration points to mak\", \"e it interesting \\nto implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one such pr\", \"oject, calling \\nit Mono.\\nThe specification also gave Microsoft some room to do what some within the \", \"company had been \\nlooking to do for quite a while: provide a research and experimentation vehicle fo\", \"r the academic and \\nresearch communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripped-down ver\", \"sion of the CLR \\nsource code, code-named \\u201cRotor,\\u201d distributed under an open-source license they crea\", \"ted, called the \\n2 ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification for the language commonly k\", \"nown as \\u201cJavaScript,\\u201d but is \\nmore rightly called \\u201cECMAScript,\\u201d governed as ECMA-262.\\n3 CLI: https:/\", \"/www.iso.org/standard/58046.html and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/\\nEcma-\", \"335.htm; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm.NET for Java Deve\", \"lopers 7\\n\\u201cShared Source\\u201d license, giving it the formal name \\u201cShared Source CLI\\u201d or \\u201cSSCLI.\\u201d While Mo\", \"no would \\nremain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, and Rotor of even les\", \"s interest to \\nthose outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source mindset were sown. Over \", \"time, Mono \\nwould be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own company, Xamarin, which would f\", \"aithfully \\nparallel the work described by the specifications and periodically try out new ideas for \", \"the open\\u0002source community to consider.\\nMicrosoft officially released the first version of C# and the\", \" CLR in 2002, and new versions came \\nroughly three years apart after that: C# 2.0 in 2005, and C# 3.\", \"0 in 2008. Each was contained in a \\nproduct release of Visual Studio, such that C# 2.0 and version 2\", \".0 of the CLR runtime was released \\nwith Visual Studio 2005, and C# 3.0 and CLR 3.5 came with Visual\", \" Studio 2008. Microsoft then shifted \\nto a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio 2010, Visual S\", \"tudio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, and most \\nrecently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the versions of C# \", \"and the CLR started falling out of lockstep \\nwith Visual Studio, deliberately, for a couple of reaso\", \"ns.\\nThe first was that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, and was starti\", \"ng to \\nunbundle its various parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independent, parts. F#\", \", which \\nfirst shipped \\u201cout of the box\\u201d in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to start down \", \"the open\\u0002source path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project, it had ne\", \"ver really \\nembraced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place. Microsof\", \"t started \\nworking shortly thereafter on an open-source rewrite of its entire compiler toolchain, co\", \"de-named \\n\\u201cRoslyn.\\u201d By the time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem were startin\", \"g to ship \\nindependently, with Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for developers to ga\", \"ther the parts \\nof the ecosystem they desired more easily. Open-source package management (called Nu\", \"Get), which \\nbegan life well outside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated into Visual\", \" Studio so that \\nNuGet came \\u201cout of the box,\\u201d much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java IDEs.\\nMon\", \"o, meanwhile, had started to gain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular, the \\ngam\", \"ing toolkit Unity had expressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running \\ninside th\", \"e Unity toolkit. Unity-based games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the \\nJavaSc\", \"ript-on-.NET implementation that Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a Python\\u0002inspired .NE\", \"T language called Boo. Additionally, the open-source community produced another .NET \\nimplementation\", \", the .NET Micro Framework, specifically aimed at embedded software systems and \\nsmall-scale hardwar\", \"e such as the Arduino platform.\\nAll of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, Micros\", \"oft announced that the source \\nfor ASP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to anyon\", \"e who wanted to look at it. It \\nwasn\\u2019t full open-source yet, though, in that they weren\\u2019t accepting \", \"pull requests. It was, however, \\nan important step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It a\", \"nnounced that it would completely \\nopen-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making it\", \" available to any platform and accept \\npull requests from any developer so inclined. A new .NET impl\", \"ementation would be completely \\nopen-source and hosted on GitHub, called .NET Core. It also announce\", \"d the creation of the .NET \\nFoundation, an industry consortium of groups dedicated to the growth of \", \"the .NET platform, in .NET for Java Developers 8\\nmuch the same fashion that the Java Community Proce\", \"ss governs the continued growth of the Java \\nplatform4.\\nTo be sure, Microsoft made some missteps alo\", \"ng the way, and definitely learned a few hard lessons \\nabout its relationship with the open-source c\", \"ommunity, but by late 2017, Microsoft was statistically \\nthe biggest contributor on GitHub (measured\", \" in terms of total numbers of contributors5), and all \\nof its key components\\u2014language, runtime, libr\", \"aries, and many of its tools\\u2014were available for \\ndownload on GitHub.\\nMicrosoft also started to get m\", \"ore serious about the cross-platform/portability aspects of the .NET \\necosystem.
