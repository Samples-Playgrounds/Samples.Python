It was our first\\ntrip out of the country, and aside from the ridiculously long flight\\u2014eight hours on an airplane feels\\nlike forever to somebody who hasn\\u2019t yet finished their first decade of life\\u2014I really had no idea of\\nwhat to expect. In fact, in an amusing anecdote my father has yet\", \" to tire of telling, I remember having\\nto sit down with my parents in front of a globe so that they could explain to me that \\u201cthe United\\nStates\\u201d was not, in fact, synonymous with \\u201cthe world.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was entirely a trip of firsts: my first experience wandering around in a world where I couldn\\u2019t\\nunderstand any of the written signs, my first experience eating food I couldn\\u2019t recognize, and my\\nfirst experience feeling completely lost in the world around\", \" me. I found, to my eight-year-old horror,\\nthat I couldn\\u2019t even figure out which bathroom to use\\u2014which, considering I had just the year before\\nmanaged to convince my mother I didn\\u2019t need to be escorted to the bathroom and back, was of\\nparticular concern. I didn\\u2019t want her to start thinking I actually needed adult supervision. This was\\nclearly not my home, and I was more than a little terrified of it.\\n\\nVisiting a foreign land, particularly to some\", \"one who has cocooned themselves entirely in the\\nconcepts and cultures of \\u201chome,\\u201d can be intimidating and overwhelming without a guide. On that trip\\nto France I had my parents, and despite neither of them speaking anything close to fluent French,\\nthey managed to guide us through the tricky parts. (French-English guidebooks are a wonderful\\nthing.)\\n\\nFor the typical Java developer, finding a guide to exploring the .NET ecosystem can be tricky, since\\n\", \"the average Java developer can still hearken back to a time when expressing an interest in looking at\\n.NET was tantamount to declaring a desire to betray everything good and right in the world (or so it\\nseemed, at least at the time).\\n\\nIn this paper, I will serve as your guide to the .NET world. I\\u2019ve been a part of the .NET ecosystem\\nalmost as long as I\\u2019ve been a part of Java\\u2019s. I started with Java in 1996; I started with what would\\nbecome .NET in\", \" 2000, even before it was announced. I\\u2019ve built applications in both, written books\\nfor both, and explored the source for both. They\\u2019re closer to one another than you might think, but\\neach has been fundamentally influenced by the people using them. In fact, it\\u2019s not a bad analogy to\\nthink of them as twin brothers, separated at birth, raised by different sets of parents. Same DNA, but\\nshaped by their experiences and events to be different in a num\", \"ber of interesting places.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re a Java developer, looking to get started exploring the .NET ecosystem, then suspend what\\nyou think you know, take my hand, and let\\u2019s take a trip to a foreign land. Doing so will require a little\\nhistory to understand how things came to be, then a quick set of instructions on how to get the\\ntooling set up (and which tooling you want, depending on your preferences). Once the environment\\nis set up, we can pick u\", \"p the critical differences between C# and Java, and start diving into some\\nof the central frameworks in this world\\u2014ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and a few others. When we\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n 1\\n\\n\\ffinish up, if you\\u2019re following along, you\\u2019ll have everything you need to start your own exploration of\\nthe .NET community, and from there you\\u2019ll get to draw your own conclusions and make your own\\nopinions.\\n\\nMost importantly, you\\u2019ll know how to order \", \"off the menu and tell the bathrooms apart.\\n\\nReady?\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  2\\n\\n\\fHistory\\n\\nIf you\\u2019d like to skip the walk down memory lane, you can jump to the next section, Getting Started.\\n\\nOstensibly, the history of .NET begins in October of 2000, at Microsoft\\u2019s Professional Developer\\nConference (PDC), when Microsoft announced to the world that they were working on a new\\nprogramming platform, on which would rest the fate of all Microsoft dev\", \"elopment to follow. It was\\ncalled .NET, it would be the backbone for their upcoming operating system (Windows Vista), it would\\nbe a part of their data management system (nicknamed \\u201cSQLServer.NET\\u201d), and it would form the\\ncore development platform for building interconnected applications into the future by leveraging\\nemerging standards such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and a few others the world had not yet really come to\\nunderstand. It would be the princip\", \"al competitor platform to their principal development rival at the\\ntime, Sun Microsystems, and its Java platform. And the world could see that the shot was fired, the\\nline in the sand drawn, and the armies drawn up; clearly, this was Microsoft copying the efforts of its\\ncompetitors, seeking dominance, and\\u2026.\\n\\nAnd most of the world completely misunderstood where .NET had come from, why it had come to\\nexist, and what Microsoft really sought to obtai\", \"n from it.\\n\\nIn fact, it\\u2019s fair to suggest that many within the Microsoft ecosystem misunderstood what .NET was\\nreally about; once announced, the marketing machine took over. Much effort was wasted due to the\\nentanglement of \\u201c.NET\\u201d with \\u201cweb services,\\u201d and it would take the better part of a decade before\\npeople could understand that the two really had nothing intrinsically to do with one another any\\nmore than \\u201cPerl\\u201d did with \\u201cdatabases.\\u201d Microsoft\", \" management compounded all this confusion by\\nre-branding the \\u201c.NET\\u201d suffix to a number of their products, which they later corrected but well after\\nthe damage had been done.\\n\\nBut despite all that, solid engineering rests at the core of .NET; all that branding and marketing made\\nit harder to see, but it\\u2019s always been there. To really understand .NET, it is necessary to see it in its\\nproper historical context: that, in truth, it was the simple \\u201cnex\", \"t step\\u201d along an evolutionary chain that\\nstretched back much further than that October keynote almost two decades ago.\\n\\nOf components, managed environments, and code\\nIn the beginning, there was C.\\n\\nTo be more accurate about it, in the beginning a number of programming languages were created\\nto make it easier to produce programs that knew how to execute on a single chip. They integrated\\ndirectly with the hardware, making use of the facilities ther\", \"e to obtain memory, interact with the\\ndisk, and present data to the display for the user to understand. In time, we as an industry found that\\nthis direct-hardware interaction had its drawbacks, and we sought to create a series of abstractions\\non top of that hardware, to help coordinate the use of the hardware across multiple simultaneously\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n 3\\n\\n\\fexecuting programs. We called that first attempt at regulating and managing \", \"the hardware an\\noperating system. And it was pretty good. So good, in fact, that numerous flavors of operating\\nsystem were born, including Microsoft\\u2019s Windows operating system, and Solaris, and macOS (though\\nit was called \\u201cSystem 7\\u201d back then), and Linux, and a few others whose names exist now only in the\\nhistory books and dusty corners of Usenet forums. (Bonus points if you recognize these names:\\nMinix, Mach, BSD, OS/2, Amiga, or BeOS. Even more\", \" bonus points if you ever ran one of them. If you\\never ran DOS, though, it just means you\\u2019re old.)\\n\\nThe bigger, more important issue, however, lay with the underlying concept of the operating system\\nitself\\u2014that programmers found it helpful and useful to have \\u201csomething else\\u201d working with their\\nprograms. That \\u201csomething else\\u201d would be responsible for certain aspects of how the programs\\nexecuted and behaved, rather than assuming that every single n\", \"uance had to be the programmers\\u2019\\nresponsibility.\\n\\nThis concept, in large, is essentially that of a \\u201cmanaged environment.\\u201d Although it has its roots\\nin operating systems, it echoes all the way down through the ages, even into the modern era of\\ncontainers and cloud: that there can be, within a program, a set of services and/or actors that are\\nresponsible for details that the programmer doesn\\u2019t want to have to deal with. Operating systems\\nare manage\", \"d environments in that they take care of how to position data on the hard drive, how to\\nschedule the execution of threads, and how to regulate access to various resources such as network\\nports or data files. Virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine are managed environments in\\nthat they regulate the access and reclamation of heap memory, transform an intermediate bytecode\\nformat into CPU-native instructions, and prevent the direct access \", \"of memory (except under very\\nspecific circumstances) in order to avoid process termination by careless programming. Containers\\nsuch as Docker are managed environments in that they provide a context around an executable\\nto mimic a precise environment\\u2014configuration files, environment variables, and shared network\\nsettings\\u2014so that developers can be assured that the environment outside their programs are\\nconsistent regardless of where they are deploy\", \"ed.\\n\\nBy the early \\u201990s, Microsoft had come to understand the need for a managed environment for\\nWindows developers to be able to take \\u201cthe next step forward\\u201d in development evolution. The \\u201cGUI\\nrevolution\\u201d of the mid-\\u201980s was largely finished; programs weren\\u2019t just about \\u201cdialogs and data,\\u201d\\nbut now needed to integrate more deeply with the GUI environment (right-click context menus, for\\nexample) and start taking advantage of networking in greater d\", \"etail. (Old developers like me will\\nremember that it was around 1995 that references to HTTP and \\u201cthe World Wide Web\\u201d were just\\nstarting to appear in publications and technology journals.)\\n\\nAs is common when developers master a new concept, new challenges emerged. C++ developers\\nhad been speaking of \\u201creusable code\\u201d for several years, but it was Visual Basic (and Delphi, along with\\nseveral other \\u201c4GL\\u201d variants) that demonstrated actual practical c\", \"ode reuse, in the form of \\u201ccontrols\\u201d:\\nwidgets that could be used across a variety of programs repeatedly without requiring in-depth\\nknowledge about the controls\\u2019 implementation. Simply obtain the library, put it into the right place\\nwithin the development environment, drag-and-drop the control into the construction area, and lo,\\nthe developer was off and running. True, C++ had created the concept of \\u201capplication frameworks,\\u201d\\nlike MFC and OWL, but\", \" \\u201cGUI builders\\u201d had demonstrated that the concept of \\u201ccontrols\\u201d could be\\nleveraged to create a marketplace of reusable atomic blocks of state, behavior, and events; now\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n   4\\n\\n\\fMicrosoft wanted to bring that concept, writ larger, into the bigger world beyond GUI development.\\nMore importantly, they also wanted to invert that relationship\\u2014make it possible for outside\\ndevelopers to build \\u201cthings\\u201d that could be used by exist\", \"ing things (such as the operating system or,\\nperhaps, the web browser) without detailed knowledge of their implementation.\\n\\nTo do that, they needed to create a managed environment that would work across a variety of\\ndifferent languages, but all operating under the same rules. That effort, called the Component\\nObject Model (COM), was the first of several \\u201cmanaged platforms\\u201d that emerged during the early-\\nand mid-\\u201990s. (Ironically, several open-sou\", \"rce efforts would go after this same space many years\\nafter Microsoft declared COM \\u201cfinished,\\u201d including Mozilla\\u2019s XPCOM.) COM itself was successful in\\nthat it became the backbone of Windows development for a significant percentage of the Windows\\nplatform. But it still failed in that it left programs vulnerable to many of the same things that had\\nplagued them before: memory leaks, mishandled pointers, and unexpected process termination at\\nthe fir\", \"st mistake. It was clear that, despite the managed platform, writing code in a \\u201cnative\\u201d language\\n(such as C/C++ or Delphi) still wasn\\u2019t a particularly great place to be.\\n\\nIt was around this same timeframe, 1995, that Sun Microsystems demonstrated the HotJava browser\\nto the world, the centerpiece of which was this language that could be used to write executable\\nbits to run inside the browser. By 1996, Microsoft had come to the realization that thi\", \"s was what it\\nwas missing: a \\u201cmanaged language\\u201d to run on top of their managed platform. A managed language\\nhad exactly the right \\u201cdistance\\u201d from the underlying operating system they were seeking\\u2014garbage\\ncollection would help prevent memory leaks and accidental crashes, and the virtual machine could\\nhelp enforce stronger security controls that the world had just started to realize they needed. It was,\\nin many ways, a perfect match. Microsoft inve\", \"sted resources into building their own JVM, extended\\ntheir IDE to include writing Java code (Visual J++), and integrated COM into the runtime.\\n\\nUnfortunately, in the last part of that sentence lay the seeds of its own destruction.\\n\\nHello, .NET\\nDivorces are never a pretty sight, and recounting the history of one is always fraught with opinion,\\nrevisionist history, and bad feeling. Suffice it to say that by 1997/1998, two facts were becoming clear:\", \"\\none, Sun didn\\u2019t care for Microsoft\\u2019s work increasing interoperability between their JVM and native\\nCOM components in Windows1, and two, Microsoft and Java were going to part ways, one way or\\nanother. (Who got custody of the dog is still hotly debated.)\\n\\nEither certain groups within Microsoft could see the writing on the wall or they had come to find\\nissues (real or perceived) with the Java Virtual Machine; either way, by 1998, a new effort came \", \"to\\nlife inside of Microsoft, designed to bring a new managed platform and managed language into the\\nworld. Originally intended as the successor to COM, it went through a variety of names, including\\n\\n1 For the curious, Microsoft offered additional platform-specific APIs that permitted interoperation with native\\nCOM components. The irony of this is deep, considering that Sun had actually allowed for COM-specific\\nnative interfaces in their JNI speci\", \"fication\\u2014the first three methods in the interface table for a JNIEnv (\\u201cJNI\\nenvironment\\u201d) object were specifically left \\u201creserved\\u201d for the necessary three methods (AddRef, Release, and\\nQueryInterface) of every COM interface object. Those three slots are still reserved to this day.\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n   5\\n\\n\\f\\u201cCOM+,\\u201d the \\u201cComponent Object Runtime\\u201d (COR), the \\u201cUniversal RunTime\\u201d (URT), and \\u201cNext-\\nGeneration Windows Services\\u201d (NGWS) before fina\", \"lly being introduced to the world as \\u201c.NET\\u201d at that\\nOctober 2000 PDC. Along with it would come a new language, code-named \\u201cCOOL\\u201d (supposedly\\nto stand for the \\u201cComponent-Oriented Object Language,\\u201d although opinions vary now) and later\\nrenamed \\u201cC#.\\u201d\\n\\nWhile most observers considered C# and the CLR (the Common Language Runtime, the virtual\\nmachine executing the bytecode) to be direct competitors of Java, Microsoft took careful steps to\\nensure that it\", \" was \\u201copen\\u201d in ways that Java was not: where the JVM was designed from the beginning\\nto be a virtual machine for a single language, the CLR embraced a more polyglot approach, with\\nMicrosoft even going so far as to recruit several universities and companies to create new languages\\nfor this platform and/or adapt existing ones. This project, nicknamed \\u201cProject 7\\u201d (for the 7 groups\\nthat participated), debuted several of these languages during .NET\\u2019s \", \"introduction, and included CLR\\nflavors of Eiffel, Perl, and even COBOL(!). Few of these languages gained any traction after the first\\nfew years of existence, and most no longer exist, but their presence had the effect on Microsoft of\\n\\u201ckeeping them honest\\u201d with respect to other languages beyond C# and Visual Basic as the platform\\ngrew and evolved. (Microsoft itself would later go on to introduce a number of new CLR-based\\nlanguages, including a com\", \"piled-to-binary version of ECMAScript, two different efforts at bringing\\nmanaged coding to C++, a hybrid object/functional language called F#, and several more research\\nlanguages.)\\n\\nHowever, Microsoft also sought to make sure that .NET was not a proprietary effort by investing\\nthousands of man-hours into the creation of a series of international specifications\\u2014through the\\nEuropean Computer Manufacturer\\u2019s Association (ECMA2)\\u2014to ensure that C# and \", \"the underlying\\nplatform were both open industry standards. C# was accepted and ratified as ECMA-334, and the\\nunderlying runtime was given the name the \\u201cCommon Language Infrastructure\\u201d (CLI), and accepted\\nand ratified as ECMA-335. Intel, HP, and several other industry participants joined Microsoft in\\nkeeping these specifications up to date with changes to the language and the platform, the most\\nrecent updates3 coming in 2012 for the CLI and 2017 f\", \"or C#.\\n\\nWith the introduction of these specifications in 2001 came an unexpected side-effect: members of\\nthe open-source community began to examine building a \\u201cclean-room\\u201d implementation of them.\\nWhile the CLI Specification didn\\u2019t include any of the Windows-specific features (such as a deep COM\\nintegration) Microsoft wanted for backwards-compatibility and forwards-evolution for their existing\\ndeveloper base, the CLI Specification itself provided \", \"enough integration points to make it interesting\\nto implement on other platforms. Miguel de Icaza, of GNOME fame, began one such project, calling\\nit Mono.\\n\\nThe specification also gave Microsoft some room to do what some within the company had been\\nlooking to do for quite a while: provide a research and experimentation vehicle for the academic and\\nresearch communities to explore. In 2002, Microsoft released a stripped-down version of the CLR\\nsourc\", \"e code, code-named \\u201cRotor,\\u201d distributed under an open-source license they created, called the\\n\\n2 ECMA, it should be noted, also owns the specification for the language commonly known as \\u201cJavaScript,\\u201d but is\\nmore rightly called \\u201cECMAScript,\\u201d governed as ECMA-262.\\n3 CLI: https://www.iso.org/standard/58046.html and http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/\\nEcma-335.htm; C#: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecm\", \"a-334.htm\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n   6\\n\\n\\f\\u201cShared Source\\u201d license, giving it the formal name \\u201cShared Source CLI\\u201d or \\u201cSSCLI.\\u201d While Mono would\\nremain the subject of only fleeting interest to some for many years, and Rotor of even less interest to\\nthose outside the .NET universe, the seeds of an open-source mindset were sown. Over time, Mono\\nwould be purchased by Novell, then spun out into its own company, Xamarin, which would faithfully\\nparallel\", \" the work described by the specifications and periodically try out new ideas for the open-\\nsource community to consider.\\n\\nMicrosoft officially released the first version of C# and the CLR in 2002, and new versions came\\nroughly three years apart after that: C# 2.0 in 2005, and C# 3.0 in 2008. Each was contained in a\\nproduct release of Visual Studio, such that C# 2.0 and version 2.0 of the CLR runtime was released\\nwith Visual Studio 2005, and C# 3.\", \"0 and CLR 3.5 came with Visual Studio 2008. Microsoft then shifted\\nto a two-year release cycle, with Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2015, and most\\nrecently, Visual Studio 2017. However, the versions of C# and the CLR started falling out of lockstep\\nwith Visual Studio, deliberately, for a couple of reasons.\\n\\nThe first was that Microsoft had again seen the writing on the wall, so to speak, and was starting to\\nunbundle its var\", \"ious parts of the .NET ecosystem into constituent, and independent, parts. F#, which\\nfirst shipped \\u201cout of the box\\u201d in Visual Studio 2010, was the first of these to start down the open-\\nsource path, largely because having started life as a Microsoft Research project, it had never really\\nembraced being commercialized (and therefore closed-source) in the first place. Microsoft started\\nworking shortly thereafter on an open-source rewrite of its enti\", \"re compiler toolchain, code-named\\n\\u201cRoslyn.\\u201d By the time of Visual Studio 2015, many parts of the core ecosystem were starting to ship\\nindependently, with Visual Studio releases serving only as a vehicle for developers to gather the parts\\nof the ecosystem they desired more easily. Open-source package management (called NuGet), which\\nbegan life well outside of the Visual Studio organization, was incorporated into Visual Studio so that\\nNuGet came \\u201co\", \"ut of the box,\\u201d much as support for Maven and Ant do in Java IDEs.\\n\\nMono, meanwhile, had started to gain some traction in an unusual place: gaming. In particular, the\\ngaming toolkit Unity had expressed interest in Mono, and soon had the Mono framework running\\ninside the Unity toolkit. Unity-based games could now be written in JavaScript (a distant fork of the\\nJavaScript-on-.NET implementation that Microsoft had done back in 2001), C#, or even a P\", \"ython-\\ninspired .NET language called Boo. Additionally, the open-source community produced another .NET\\nimplementation, the .NET Micro Framework, specifically aimed at embedded software systems and\\nsmall-scale hardware such as the Arduino platform.\\n\\nAll of this, however, was the calm before the storm. In 2008, Microsoft announced that the source\\nfor ASP.NET (the servlet/JSP equivalent) would be accessible to anyone who wanted to look at it. It\\nwa\", \"sn\\u2019t full open-source yet, though, in that they weren\\u2019t accepting pull requests. It was, however,\\nan important step, and in 2014 Microsoft took that final step: It announced that it would completely\\nopen-source all of .NET, hosting it on GitHub, and thus making it available to any platform and accept\\npull requests from any developer so inclined. A new .NET implementation would be completely\\nopen-source and hosted on GitHub, called .NET Core. It a\", \"lso announced the creation of the .NET\\nFoundation, an industry consortium of groups dedicated to the growth of the .NET platform, in\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n   7\\n\\n\\fmuch the same fashion that the Java Community Process governs the continued growth of the Java\\nplatform4.\\n\\nTo be sure, Microsoft made some missteps along the way, and definitely learned a few hard lessons\\nabout its relationship with the open-source community, but by late 2017, Micro\", \"soft was statistically\\nthe biggest contributor on GitHub (measured in terms of total numbers of contributors5), and all\\nof its key components\\u2014language, runtime, libraries, and many of its tools\\u2014were available for\\ndownload on GitHub.\\n\\nMicrosoft also started to get more serious about the cross-platform/portability aspects of the .NET\\necosystem. Xamarin, which by 2009 had started producing tools that could cross-compile .NET\\nbytecode into native app\", \"lications for iOS and Android platforms (the catchy-named \\u201cMonoDroid\\u201d\\nand less-catchy \\u201cMono for iOS\\u201d toolkits), was flourishing, and Microsoft realized that a practical story\\nfor being able to share non-UI portions of code across multiple platforms was necessary if they\\nwanted to avoid developer confusion.\\n\\nWhile the ECMA Specifications had discussed different \\u201cprofiles\\u201d for levels of .NET standardization,\\nthese profiles were in many ways similar\", \" to their \\u201cJava Standard Edition,\\u201d \\u201cJava Micro Edition,\\u201d and\\n\\u201cJava Enterprise Edition\\u201d cousins\\u2014a little unwieldy in a number of ways, but most notably in that\\nthere wasn\\u2019t really a good way to guarantee compatibility across platforms and implementation\\nversions\\u2014if code is compiled by the Java6 compiler, it is safe to assume that it will continue to run on\\nthe Java6 virtual machine from whence it was compiled, but the Java APIs do change from rele\", \"ase to\\nrelease, and this has tripped up the unwary Java developer from time to time.\\n\\nThus, in 2016, Microsoft announced the \\u201c.NET Standard 1.0\\u201d profile, a collection not of relatively\\nvague implementation documents, but an actual API standard, such that a developer who sought\\nto build a library that could be used by a variety of different platforms (across a certain number of\\nversions of that platform, even) could know that anything that impleme\", \"nted .NET Standard 1.0 would\\nbe able to consume that library, regardless of where that code is running\\u2014on a web server, on a\\nmobile device, or even on somebody\\u2019s VR helmet (running a 3D interactive application written with\\nUnity).\\n\\nWhich brings us, now, to the current day.\\n\\n4 Ironically, Microsoft\\u2019s move to the .NET Foundation comes at the same time Oracle is looking to move\\naway from the JCP; both companies have experience with standards organiz\", \"ations, and neither wants to see\\ninnovation stifled in committee.\\n5 http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-open-source-2016-9\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n   8\\n\\n\\fHello, strange new world\\nTo the Java developer, this is a strange, strange world compared to the one they glimpsed into back\\nin 2000.\\n\\nFor starters, the Java world looks wildly different than it once did. Sun no longer exists, acquired\\nby Oracle. Oracle and Google squabble in the \", \"courtroom over the legal implications of Java on\\nAndroid devices. Spring was acquired, then spun out into its own company, Pivotal. JBoss absorbed\\ninto Red Hat. IBM no longer really even tries to push Java much anymore. Does anybody even\\nremember EJB? Or that it was once \\u201ca thing\\u201d? Who would\\u2019ve guessed any of this back in 2001?\\n\\nBut meanwhile, over in the Microsoft world, a new CEO runs the firm, and he has made it clear that\\nMicrosoft is an open\", \"-source player. A new player, to be sure, and still finding its feet in a variety of\\nways, but one committed to the open-source community.

Thus, we can write the traditional \\u201cPerson\\u201d type in C# like so:\\n\\nclass Person\\n{\\n    public string FirstName\\n    {\\n        get { return this.firstName; }\\n        set { this.firstName = value; }\\n    }\\n    private string firstName;\\n\\n    public s\", \"tring LastName\\n    {\\n        get { return this.lastName; }\\n        set { this.lastName = value; }\\n    }\\n    private string lastName;\\n\\n    public int Age\\n    {\\n        get { return this.age; }\\n        set { this.age = value; }\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n 21\\n\\n\\f    }\\n    private int age;\\n    public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\\n    {\\n        this.FirstName = fn;\\n        this.LastName = ln;\\n        this.Age = a;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nProperties can be read-\", \"only by eliminating the \\u201cset\\u201d clause, and write-only (if that makes sense,\\nwhich it rarely does) by eliminating the \\u201cget\\u201d clause.

But what about those scenarios where we want to have the property available\\nto be read by anyone (public access), but only accessible for mutation from within the class (private\\naccess)? The get and set clauses can have different levels of\", \" access, the most common idiom being:\\n\\nclass Person\\n{\\n    public string FirstName { get; private set; }\\n    public string LastName { get; private set; }\\n    public int Age { get; private set; }\\n\\n    public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\\n    {\\n        this.FirstName = fn;\\n        this.LastName = ln;\\n        this.Age = a;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nThis will effectively make the fields immutable from the outside yet still something we can\\nchange from the interi\", \"or of the class. The field itself is synthesized by the compiler (usually with\\na straightforward name such as \\u201c__$<Person>$<FirstName>@5417,\\u201d or something equally non-\\nobvious), and won\\u2019t be directly accessible by code. (Granted, one can always use System.Reflection\\u2014\\nthe .NET direct equivalent to Java\\u2019s java.lang.reflect package\\u2014to access the field at runtime, but\\nthat\\u2019s an awful lot of work to work around something that can be discarded at any t\", \"ime.) For those\\nrare situations where the auto-generated properties don\\u2019t do the right thing, C# developers can\\nalways \\u201cdrop back\\u201d to writing the property clauses out longhand and wrapping a declared field.\\n\\nMethods, meanwhile, work pretty much the same way they do in Java, in terms of their declaration\\nand syntax. Methods can be instance methods or static (although static method invocations must\\nalways go through the class name, whereas Java wil\", \"l allow calling a static method through an\\ninstance variable\\u2014seriously, try it, it\\u2019s weird), and parameters are declared in order with a type and a\\nname:\\n\\npublic class Person\\n{\\n    public string FirstName { get; set; }\\n    public string LastName { get; set; }\\n    public int Age { get; set; }\\n\\n    public Person(string fn, string ln, int a)\\n    {\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  23\\n\\n\\f        this.FirstName = fn;\\n        this.LastName = ln;\\n        this\", \".Age = a;\\n    }\\n    public void SayHello(string recipient)\\n    {\\n        Console.WriteLine(\\\"Hello, {0}, I, {1}, say hello.\\\",\\n            recipient, FirstName);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Program\\n{\\n    static void Main(string[] args)\\n    {\\n        Person p = new Person(\\\"Ted\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 46);\\n        p.SayHello(\\\"Fred\\\");\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nAs you can see, C# follows pretty much exactly the same rules that Java does for method declaration\\nand invocation. But, again, C# all\", \"ows for some interesting variations on this theme.\\n\\nFor starters, C# has had the concept of \\u201cmethod literals\\u201d since 1.0, though the syntax has changed\\nover each successive revision of the language. The first step was \\u201cdelegates,\\u201d essentially the ability\\nto declare a method signature and then assign methods-on-object-instances to a given delegate\\ninstance, like so:\\n\\nclass Person\\n{\\n    // . . .\\n    public delegate void HelloProc(string recipient);\\n\", \"    public HelloProc IndirectSayHello;\\n}\\nclass Program\\n{\\n    static void Main(string[] args)\\n    {\\n        Person p = new Person(\\\"Ted\\\", \\\"Neward\\\", 46);\\n        p.SayHello(\\\"Fred\\\");\\n\\n        p.IndirectSayHello = p.SayHello;\\n        p.IndirectSayHello(\\\"Fred\\\");\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  24\\n\\n\\fThis was a pretty verbose way of doing method-reference-capture, and with successive versions of\\nC#, they simplified it, particularly once the .NET pla\", \"tform introduced generics. (Yes, C# has generics,\\nyes they look syntactically almost identical to Java generics, but no, they don\\u2019t work the same way\\nwhen compiled\\u2014where Java uses \\u201ctype erasure,\\u201d C# uses \\u201creified generics\\u201d and persists the generic\\ndefinition all the way into the compiled bytecode.) The \\u201cdelegate\\u201d keyword here introduces a new\\ntype\\u2014a function pointer, if you will\\u2014and we can declare an instance of the delegate on the Person\\nclass, \", \"assign a method to it, and invoke the assigned method through that delegate.\\n\\nLambdas, type inference, and extension classes\\nBy the time C# 3.0 came around, however, C# supported full-bore lambda syntax, complete with\\nmethod parameter type inference, so that we could write method literals in-line:\\n\\n        p.IndirectSayHello = (recipient) => {\\n            Console.WriteLine(\\\"Hey, {0}. Whatever.\\\", recipient);\\n        };\\n        p.IndirectSayHello(\\\"\", \"Shaggy\\\");\\n\\nLambdas turned out to be a major turning point within the C# language, along with several other\\nfeatures of the C# 3.0 release, including local variable type inference, which simply allows for the\\nkeyword \\u201cvar\\u201d to appear in place of the type in a local variable declaration, like so:\\n\\n        var x = 12;\\n        var y = \\\"Fred\\\";\\n        var z = p.IndirectSayHello;\\n        z(\\\"Wilma\\\");\\n\\nThe \\u201cvar\\u201d keyword does not, as some in the Java world\", \" theorized at its introduction, create an\\nuntyped variable; the C# compiler simply infers the variable\\u2019s type from the right-hand-side\\nexpression, and assigns that to the variable type. Thus, the \\u201cx\\u201d variable is strongly typed as an\\ninteger (since that is an integer literally on the right-hand side), \\u201cy\\u201d is a string, and \\u201cz\\u201d is a delegate\\nthat accepts a method reference that takes a single string parameter and returns void. All the\\n\\u201cvar\\u201d keyword \", \"does, simply, is allow the C# developer a brief respite from having to type out type\\nsignatures in places where the compiler could figure it out on its own.\\n\\nOn top of this, Microsoft also introduced a fascinating feature called \\u201cextension classes,\\u201d which has\\nfound its way into other languages such as Swift.

Somewhat confus\", \"ingly, however, all three are referred to by the name \\u201cASP.NET.\\u201d\\n\\n(Note to those who recognize the \\u201cASP\\u201d moniker from the early days of the Sun/Microsoft rivalry: In\\nthe COM days, Microsoft\\u2019s web technology was called \\u201cActive Server Pages,\\u201d ASP for short, named\\nafter ActiveX, one of the marketing names for COM. When Microsoft started working on the CLR\\ninternally, one of its most important consumers was the ASP team, who sought to create a system\", \"\\nsimilar to JSP to replace ASP.

It was designed to try to bring a VisualBasic-style design philosophy\\nto the web, but by .NET 3.0, the Microsoft community had come to understand the design\\nadvantages of an MVC-style design approach, and all work on WebForms essentially ceased.\\nIronically, about the time that interest in WebForms was ending, the Java community was building\\nup JSF, the equivalent to WebForms in Java.\\n\\n\\u2022  ASP.NET MVC: Based on the class\", \"ic \\u201cModel-View-Controller\\u201d principles that the Sun \\u201cModel 2\\u201d\\n\\ndesign for servlets and JSP first laid out, Microsoft created ASP.NET MVC, released the source code\\nfor it shortly after its initial release, and has considered this to be its first-class server-side web\\nframework ever since. ASP.NET MVC was rebranded (and refactored) to be \\u201cASP.NET Core MVC\\u201d in\\n2015, in keeping with the \\u201c.NET Core\\u201d naming for the cross-platform runtime, and has made s\", \"ome\\nconceptual shifts as new frameworks\\u2014such as Ruby-on-Rails\\u2014gained popularity and created\\nsome new patterns (such as routing tables).\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  29\\n\\n\\f\\u2022  ASP.NET MVC Web API: While the name certainly gets no points for brevity, it does accurately\\nreflect the idea that this framework is built off of the same concepts that underlie the ASP.NET\\nMVC library, but with the intent of producing JSON data instead of HTML. When ASP.NET M\", \"VC was\\ntagged with the \\u201cCore\\u201d moniker, the \\u201cMVC\\u201d was formally dropped from Web API projects, so that\\nnow they are simply \\u201cASP.NET Core Web API,\\u201d or more informally, \\u201cWeb API\\u201d projects.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s have a look at a quick ASP.NET Core Web API application\\u2014the ubiquitous TODO list\\u2014and then\\nwe\\u2019ll have a quick look at an MVC application before we look at Microsoft\\u2019s data-storage framework,\\nEntity Framework.\\n\\nASP.NET Core Web API\\nTo get started with Core Web\", \" API, we first need to scaffold out the Web API template; this can be\\ndone either via \\u201cFile|New\\u201d in one of the Visual Studio IDEs, or from the command-line using the .NET\\nCore CLI tools by executing \\u201cdotnet new webapi -o todoapi.\\u201d This will create a subdirectory called\\n\\u201ctodoapi\\u201d and install the .NET Core Web API project inside of it. Out of the box, it scaffolds out a\\nsimple API that has one controller to hand back arbitrary \\u201cvalue\\u201d objects, acce\", \"ssible at\\nhttp://localhost:5000/api/values. Before we make any changes to the code, it\\u2019s always good to make\\nsure the scaffold is working, so execute a \\u201cdotnet run\\u201d from within the \\u201ctodoapi\\u201d directory, and\\nnavigate to the given URL; the response should be a dirt-simple JSON array containing two strings.\\n\\nA Web API project, like its cousin the MVC application, is broken into models and controllers, with\\nthe \\u201cview\\u201d assumed to be an automated conver\", \"sion from a model object into JSON. Thus, in a Web\\nAPI project, the goal will be to accept incoming requests, perform the necessary business logic, and\\nreturn the appropriate model type, usually corresponding to the resource type in the URL, to be\\nconverted to JSON.\\n\\nThe Controllers directory contains the code for the ValuesController, which is the default-scaffolded\\ncode. It doesn\\u2019t use any model objects, which means it\\u2019s clearly inferior. Let\\u2019s\", \" delete it, and replace it\\nwith something that\\u2019s a little more \\u201cMV\\u201d-like. That means, first of all, that we need a model object to\\nrepresent a TODO item, which is a pretty simple domain object:\\n\\npublic class Todo\\n{\\n    public long ID { get; set; }\\n    public string Description { get; set; }\\n    public bool Completed { get; set; }\\n\\n    public Todo()\\n    {\\n        Completed = false;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  30\\n\\n\\f(Note that it would be a\", \" bit irregular to call this a POJO, since it\\u2019s not a Java object, but that\\u2019s basically\\nexactly what this is.

Definitely doesn\\u2019t roll off the tongue like POJOs, but we do\\nwhat we can.)\\n\\nHaving a domain object, it now remains to build a controller that will respond to the appropriate\\nURL (which, by convention, will be prefixed by \\u201c/ap\", \"i,\\u201d but is of course configurable). The Web API\\nexpectation is that a controller will be a class that has a number of public methods that obey some\\nconventions, in terms of both method names and parameter sets, like Java has done with later\\nversions of the Servlet and EJB specifications.\\n\\n    [Route(\\\"api/[controller]\\\")]\\n    public class TodosController : Controller\\n    {\\n        private List<Todo> todos = new List<Todo>() {\\n          new Todo() {\", \" ID=0, Description=\\\"Get milk\\\", Completed=true },\\n          new Todo() { ID=1, Description=\\\"Get pet food\\\" },\\n          new Todo() { ID=2, Description=\\\"Learn .NET Core\\\" },\\n          new Todo() { ID=3, Description=\\\"Write billion-dollar app\\\" }\\n        };\\n\\n        // GET api/todos\\n        [HttpGet]\\n        public IEnumerable<Todo> Get()\\n        {\\n            return todos;\\n        }\\n\\n        // GET api/todos/5\\n        [HttpGet(\\\"{id}\\\")]\\n        public T\", \"odo Get(int id)\\n        {\\n            return todos.First((t) => t.ID == id);\\n        }\\n\\n        // POST api/todos\\n        [HttpPost]\\n        public void Post([FromBody]Todo value)\\n        {\\n            todos.Add(value);\\n        }\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  31\\n\\n\\f        // PUT api/todos/5\\n        [HttpPut(\\\"{id}\\\")]\\n        public void Put(int id, [FromBody]Todo value)\\n        {\\n            var todo = todos.First((t) => t.ID == id);\\n            to\", \"do.Description = value.Description;\\n            todo.Completed = value.Completed;\\n        }\\n\\n        // DELETE api/todos/5\\n        [HttpDelete(\\\"{id}\\\")]\\n        public void Delete(int id)\\n        {\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\nTo understand this class, it\\u2019s important to understand a few things: First, the square-bracketed\\ndeclarations outside each method are what .NET calls \\u201ccustom attributes,\\u201d which, true story, figured\\nprominently in the design for JSR-175 \", \"annotations. The attributes provide information (via reflection,\\nsame way annotations do) about how HTTP verbs should match against the methods\\u2014so, for\\nexample, the ASP.NET runtime can know that the two Get() methods should both be invoked when\\nan incoming GET request is made.\\n\\nThe other half of that binding, of course, is knowing the partial URL pattern that should trigger the\\nmethod. Notice that the controller class itself has an attribute, \\u201cRo\", \"uting,\\u201d which contains the string\\n\\u201capi/[controller].\\u201d The square-bracketed \\u201ccontroller\\u201d is to tell the ASP.NET runtime to use the name\\nof the class, minus its \\u201c-Controller\\u201d suffix, so the URL pattern for all of these API endpoints is \\u201capi/\\ntodos.\\u201d From here, standard REST conventions kick in\\u2014a GET to \\u201capi/todos\\u201d should return all of the\\nTODO items, so the Get() method taking no parameters and returning an IEnumerable<Todo> (think\\nof it as a high-\", \"level iterator interface) is the right one to invoke here. If, on the other hand, a caller\\nwants a single TODO, they\\u2019ll issue a request with a URL pattern of \\u201capi/todos/\\u201d plus the ID of the\\nTODO requested. The second Get() method indicates that the URL pattern includes \\u201c{id},\\u201d so \\u201capi/\\ntodos/3\\u201d will extract \\u201c3\\u201d and pass it for the value of \\u201cid\\u201d to the method. Ditto for the Put and Delete\\nmethods.\\n\\nThe full details of routing are in the ASP.NET do\", \"cumentation, but this should be sufficient to\\nunderstand what\\u2019s happening here.

It\\u2019s the same MVC\\nwe find in most modern web frameworks; views are rendered using a particular template syntax,\\ncalled \\u201cRazor\\u201d (or \\u201cRazor pages\\u201d) that is designed to be expressive yet terse. It\\u2019s a syntax inspired\\nfrom other similar frameworks, particularly JSP and Ruby-on-Rails, but also tried to be reasonably\\nfamiliar to generations of ASP and ASP.NET WebForms developers.\", \" Controllers look almost the same\\nas they do in the API scenario, and models, of course, are just C# classes representing the domain.\\n\\nRazor templates use a .cshtml extension, and like JSP, they use different syntax to indicate which\\nparts of the page are to be interpreted in a code-aware manner, as opposed to being taken literally\\nas output format. Razor syntax uses the \\u201c@\\u201d symbol to set off code blocks or other processing\\nstatements in several \", \"different ways; for example, to do a simple \\u201cfor\\u201d loop within a page, Razor uses\\nan \\u201c@for\\u201d to set off the loop. Unlike JSP, however, the Razor syntax is clear enough that there isn\\u2019t a\\nneed to require explicit symbols to set off between code and HTML output:\\n\\n<h2>Welcome</h2>\\n\\n<ul>\\n    @for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)\\n    {\\n        <li>Beetlejuice</li>\\n    }\\n</ul>\\n\\nViews, of course, can make use of objects and data provided by a controller, often by \", \"making use\\nof a predefined key-value map called ViewData. If we want the message and the number of times\\nit should be printed to be set up by a controller (perhaps the controller is obtaining it from HTML\\nquery parameters or a database), then the controller can set those by using the keys \\u201cMessage\\u201d and\\n\\u201cNumTimes\\u201d in the ViewData dictionary, respectively. The view can then display them like this:\\n\\n<h2>Welcome</h2>\\n\\n<ul>\\n    @for (int i = 0; i < (i\", \"nt)ViewData[\\\"NumTimes\\\"]; i++)\\n    {\\n        <li>@ViewData[\\\"Message\\\"]</li>\\n    }\\n</ul>\\n\\nIn essence, ViewData is the ASP.NET equivalent to Servlet \\u201crequest\\u201d scope.\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  33\\n\\n\\fThe controller perspective that drives this looks remarkably similar to what a servlet controller would\\ndo, with a few differences:\\n\\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\\nusing System.Text.Encodings.Web;\\n\\nnamespace MvcMovie.Controllers\\n{\\n    public class Hello\", \"WorldController : Controller\\n    {\\n        public IActionResult Welcome(string name, int numTimes = 1)\\n        {\\n            ViewData[\\\"Message\\\"] = \\\"Hello \\\" + name;\\n            ViewData[\\\"NumTimes\\\"] = numTimes;\\n\\n            return View();\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nNotice that the Welcome method takes two parameters, which will be filled in from HTML query\\nparameters, fills in the ViewData dictionary, and then calls \\u201cView,\\u201d which then looks for a Razor pag\", \"e\\nfile whose name matches that of the method\\u2014in this case, it will be looking for \\u201cWelcome.cshtml.\\u201d\\nASP.NET Core MVC has a number of ways to adjust and change these conventions, but out of the\\nbox, the convention-based approach makes it simpler and easier than the configuration descriptor\\napproach of older Servlet versions.\\n\\nASP.NET Core MVC obviously consists of a great deal more than just what we\\u2019ve discussed here, but\\nthe underlying message sh\", \"ould be clear: ASP.NET Core (both the MVC and the Web API versions)\\nlearned a great deal from its contemporaries, including those in the Servlet world (JSP, the Play\\nframework, and more), and as such, it will be very straightforward for a Java developer to pick up and\\nexplore.\\n\\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into the code above, consider having a look into this tutorial:\\nhttps://aka.ms/first-web-api.\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  34\\n\\n\\fEntit\", \"y Framework Core\\nOf course, being able to access the server and pass JSON back and forth is only half the story; the\\nother half is taking that data and storing it. Or rather, storing it, indexing it, searching it, collating\\nit, sorting it, drawing pretty graphs with it, and more. When working with a relational database,\\nthe technology Microsoft offers its .NET constituents is called Entity Framework, or EF, and in many\\nrespects it works like any \", \"other object/relational mapping framework does. Thanks to some of the\\nlanguage features in C#, however, in many cases working with EF is actually easier than working with\\nJPA or Hibernate.\\n\\nLike much in the .NET universe, Entity Framework is undergoing a bit of a reshuffle; what used to\\nbe a closed, proprietary source base is now open, and as EF was opened to the world, the project\\nowners thought a (slight) rebrand seemed appropriate. As a result\", \", the open-source version of EF is\\ncalled \\u201cEntity Framework Core,\\u201d and to begin using it, we need to install it into the project via NuGet,\\neither by using the Package Manager in Visual Studio, or by using the command-line for .NET Core by\\nentering:\\n\\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\\n\\nThis is, of course, assuming we are using SQLServer\\u2014since not everybody uses SQL Server, however,\\na number of different EF database provide\", \"rs are available, including MySQL, Postgres, SQLite,\\nFirebase, and a few more. (Third-party vendors are constantly introducing new ones, in a manner\\nsimilar to the JDBC driver ecosystem, so bear in mind that Microsoft may not even know all the EF\\nproviders in the world.)\\n\\nThere\\u2019re a few \\u201cmanagement\\u201d tasks that will be easier to do from the command-line, and EF has a\\ncommand-line package that installs \\u201cinside\\u201d the standard .NET Core command-line t\", \"ool, but as of this\\nwriting, making use of it requires adding a line by hand to the project\\u2019s .csproj file:\\n\\n<ItemGroup>\\n  <DotNetCliToolReference\\n     Include=\\\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet\\\"\\n     Version=\\\"2.0.0\\\" />\\n</ItemGroup>\\n\\nIn addition, the EF Core command-ling tooling requires another dependent package:\\n\\ndotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design\\n\\nAt this point, EF should be installed and ready to go. More detaile\", \"d instructions can be found on the\\nMicrosoft docs site at https://aka.ms/ef-install.\\n\\nFundamentally, the most critical element to using EF from a project is the DbContext. This is a class\\nfrom which a project will create a derived class that represents the \\u201ccontext\\u201d for this project against\\nthe database\\u2014it will be a repository, session, and gateway, all rolled into one. Like many object/\\nrelational tools, it also provides some core behavior, incl\", \"uding some migration capabilities (database\\nversioning).\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  35\\n\\n\\fLike Hibernate or JPA, EF uses classes to represent entities in the database, and these classes are\\noften referred to as \\u201cmodel\\u201d objects, since they typically serve that purpose in an MVC and/or Web\\nAPI application. These will usually look like \\u201cplain old C# objects,\\u201d with the odd custom attribute to\\nhelp give EF some additional hints about how to map to th\", \"e database table they represent.\\n\\nFor example, if the application is a blog, then we will want classes representing a blog, and blog\\npost, representing a single blog entry. But there\\u2019s also some blog metadata we might want to track\\nthat wouldn\\u2019t be appropriate to store in the database (such as whether the blog was stored in the\\ndatabase), which we will want Entity Framework to ignore entirely. One way to do this is to use a\\ncustom attribute, or t\", \"he EF Fluent API can indicate that the blog metadata class should be ignored\\nusing the \\u201cOnModelCreating\\u201d method, invoked when the database schema is created.\\n\\npublic class BloggingContext : DbContext\\n{\\n    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }\\n\\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\\n    {\\n        modelBuilder.Ignore<BlogMetadata>();\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npublic class Blog\\n{\\n    public int BlogId { get; set; }\\n    public string\", \" Url { get; set; }\\n\\n    public List<Post> Posts { get; set; }\\n\\n    public BlogMetadata Metadata { get; set; }\\n}\\n\\npublic class Post\\n{\\n    public int PostId { get; set; }\\n    public string Title { get; set; }\\n    public string Content { get; set; }\\n\\n    public Blog Blog { get; set; }\\n}\\npublic class BlogMetadata\\n{\\n    public DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; }\\n}\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  36\\n\\n\\fThe \\u201cId\\u201d fields, of course, are typically primar\", \"y key integer columns in the database, and the List\\nof Posts is a classic one-to-many relationship. All of this will be eminently familiar to any user of\\nHibernate, JPA, or other object-relational modeling system. What will be different will be the way in\\nwhich queries and modifiers are run; thanks to LINQ, Entity Framework uses an entirely new style of\\nquery starting from the DbSet fields modeled on the DbContext-inheriting class. To do a query \", \"to\\nfetch all the blogs from the system, we simply create an instance of the context inside of a \\u201cusing\\u201d\\nblock (which is the inspiration for the try-with-resources block in Java7), and use that instance to\\nobtain the set of Blog instances and iterate through them:\\n\\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext())\\n{\\n    foreach (var blog in context.Blogs) {\\n        // do something with the blog\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nContrary to what we experienced during the heyday \", \"of EJB Entity Beans, however, this isn\\u2019t a case\\nof early loading or late loading; under the hood, Entity Framework is making use of \\u201cenumerator\\nobjects\\u201d (very similar to Java8 streams and the Java Iterable<T> interface) to fetch objects in batches,\\njust as a typical database cursor would do.\\n\\nIn the Java world, however, filtering that list of blogs to include only those that have \\u201cdotnet\\u201d in\\nthe URL presented problems\\u2014either the filtering happens\", \" on the database side, in which case the\\nquery has to be translated to SQL, or the filtering happens on the client side, which means the entire\\ncollection has to be brought over the network. With LINQ, however, this looks like this:\\n\\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext())\\n{\\n    foreach (var blog in context.Blogs\\n        .Where(b => b.Url.Contains(\\\"dotnet\\\"))) {\\n        // do something with the blog\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nBut this has the same drawbacks as \", \"before; instead, we can use an \\u201cexpression tree,\\u201d a feature of\\nLINQ that compiles into a runtime structure that reflects the compiled code:\\n\\nusing (var context = new BloggingContext())\\n{\\n    var allDotnetBlogUrls = from blog in context.Blogs\\n        where blog.Url.Contains(\\\"dotnet\\\")\\n        select blog.Url;\\n\\n.NET for Java Developers\\n\\n  37\\n\\n\\f    foreach (var url in allDotnetBlogUrls) {\\n        // do something with the blog URL\\n        // note we d\", \"on't have the entire Blog, just the Url\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nThis \\u201cfrom-where-select\\u201d syntax that looks so much like SQL isn\\u2019t; it\\u2019s a syntax that\\u2019s designed to look\\nsimilar to SQL and offer many of the same kinds of operators and options. However, this isn\\u2019t an SQL\\nquery\\u2014it will not be sent to the database. Instead, the expression tree is analyzed\\u2014and optimized\\u2014\\nby the EF plumbing to generate an efficient SQL statement, on a driver-by-driver basis. This mea\", \"ns\\nthat the query filters and restrictions are analyzed on the client side, but sent to the database to be\\nexecuted\\u2014for example, the above turns into a \\u201cSELECT url FROM blog WHERE\\u2026\\u201d using whatever\\nprimitives to do a string-containment check that the database and EF provider offers. This is really\\nthe best-of-both-worlds scenario. Couple that with the compile-time type checking that the C#\\ncompiler provides against the model objects, and you have \", \"a solution that is entirely new to the Java\\nworld.
