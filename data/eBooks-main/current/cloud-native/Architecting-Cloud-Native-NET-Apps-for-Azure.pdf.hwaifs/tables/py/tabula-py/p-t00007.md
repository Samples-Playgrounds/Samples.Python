|  0 | Reliability  |          | Build workloads that are both resilient and       |
|  1 |              |          | available. Resiliency enables workloads to        |
|  2 |              |          | recover from failures and continue functioning.   |
|  3 |              |          | Availability ensures users access to your         |
|  4 |              |          | workload at all times. Design applications to     |
|  5 |              |          | expect failures and recover from them.            |
|  6 | Security     |          | Implement security across the entire lifecycle of |
|  7 |              |          | an application, from design and implementation    |
|  8 |              |          | to deployment and operations. Pay close           |
|  9 |              |          | attention to identity management, infrastructure  |
| 10 |              |          | access, application security, and data            |
| 11 |              |          | sovereignty and encryption.                       |
