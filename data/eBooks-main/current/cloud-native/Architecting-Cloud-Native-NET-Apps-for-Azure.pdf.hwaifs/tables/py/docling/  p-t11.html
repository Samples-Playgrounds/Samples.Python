    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>5 - Build, Release, Run</td>
      <td>Each release must enforce a strict separation across the build, release, and run stages. Each should be tagged with a unique ID and support the ability to roll back. Modern CI/CD systems help fulfill this principle.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>6 - Processes</td>
      <td>Each microservice should execute in its own process, isolated from other running services. Externalize required state to a backing service such as a distributed cache or data store.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>7 - Port Binding</td>
      <td>Each microservice should be self-contained with its interfaces and functionality exposed on its own port. Doing so provides isolation from other microservices.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>8 - Concurrency</td>
      <td>When capacity needs to increase, scale out services horizontally across multiple identical processes (copies) as opposed to scaling-up a single large instance on the most powerful machine available. Develop the application to be concurrent making scaling out in cloud environments seamless.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>9 - Disposability</td>
      <td>Service instances should be disposable. Favor fast startup to increase scalability opportunities and graceful shutdowns to leave the system in a correct state. Docker containers along with an orchestrator inherently satisfy this requirement.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>10 - Dev/Prod Parity</td>
      <td>Keep environments across the application lifecycle as similar as possible, avoiding costly shortcuts. Here, the adoption of containers can greatly contribute by promoting the same execution environment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>6</th>
      <td>11 - Logging</td>
      <td>Treat logs generated by microservices as event streams. Process them with an event aggregator. Propagate log data to data- mining/log management tools like Azure Monitor or Splunk and eventually to long-term archival.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>7</th>
      <td>12 - Admin Processes</td>
      <td>Run administrative/management tasks, such as data cleanup or computing analytics, as one-off processes. Use independent tools to invoke these tasks from the production environment, but separately from the application.</td>
