|  0 | 1 - Code Base        | A single code base for each microservice, stored in its own repository. Tracked with version control, it can deploy to multiple environments (QA, Staging, Production).                                                                |
|  1 | 2 - Dependencies     | Each microservice isolates and packages its own dependencies, embracing changes without impacting the entire system.                                                                                                                   |
|  2 | 3 - Configurations   | Configuration information is moved out of the microservice and externalized through a configuration management tool outside of the code. The same deployment can propagate across environments with the correct configuration applied. |
|  3 | 4 - Backing Services | Ancillary resources (data stores, caches, message brokers) should be exposed via an addressable URL. Doing so decouples the resource from the application, enabling it to be interchangeable.                                          |
