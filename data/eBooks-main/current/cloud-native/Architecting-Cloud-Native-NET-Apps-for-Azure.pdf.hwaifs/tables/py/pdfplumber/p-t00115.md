|  0 | Consistency Level | Description                                       |
|  1 | Eventual          | No ordering guarantee for reads. Replicas will    |
|    |                   | eventually converge.                              |
|  2 | Constant Prefix   | Reads are still eventual, but data is returned in |
|    |                   | the ordering in which it is written.              |
|  3 | Session           | Guarantees you can read any data written          |
|    |                   | during the current session. It is the default     |
|    |                   | consistency level.                                |
|  4 | Bounded Staleness | Reads trail writes by interval that you specify.  |
|  5 | Strong            | Reads are guaranteed to return most recent        |
|    |                   | committed version of an item. A client never      |
|    |                   | sees an uncommitted or partial read.              |
