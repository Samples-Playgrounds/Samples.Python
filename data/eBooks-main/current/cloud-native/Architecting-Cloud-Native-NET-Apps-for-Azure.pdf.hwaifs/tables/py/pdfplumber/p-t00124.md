|  1 | Retry           | Configures retry operations on designated         |
|    |                 | operations.                                       |
|  2 | Circuit Breaker | Blocks requested operations for a predefined      |
|    |                 | period when faults exceed a configured            |
|    |                 | threshold                                         |
|  3 | Timeout         | Places limit on the duration for which a caller   |
|    |                 | can wait for a response.                          |
|  4 | Bulkhead        | Constrains actions to fixed-size resource pool to |
|    |                 | prevent failing calls from swamping a resource.   |
|  5 | Cache           | Stores responses automatically.                   |
|  6 | Fallback        | Defines structured behavior upon a failure.       |
