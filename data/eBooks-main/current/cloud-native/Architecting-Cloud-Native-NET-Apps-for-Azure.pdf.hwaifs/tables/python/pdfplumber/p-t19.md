|  1 | Reliability | Build workloads that are both resilient and       |
|    |             | available. Resiliency enables workloads to        |
|    |             | recover from failures and continue functioning.   |
|    |             | Availability ensures users access to your         |
|    |             | workload at all times. Design applications to     |
|    |             | expect failures and recover from them.            |
|  2 | Security    | Implement security across the entire lifecycle of |
|    |             | an application, from design and implementation    |
|    |             | to deployment and operations. Pay close           |
|    |             | attention to identity management, infrastructure  |
|    |             | access, application security, and data            |
|    |             | sovereignty and encryption.                       |
