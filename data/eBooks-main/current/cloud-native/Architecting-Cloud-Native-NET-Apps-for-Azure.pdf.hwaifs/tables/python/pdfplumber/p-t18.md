|  1 | 13 - API First                     | Make everything a service. Assume your code      |
|    |                                    | will be consumed by a front-end client, gateway, |
|    |                                    | or another service.                              |
|  2 | 14 - Telemetry                     | On a workstation, you have deep visibility into  |
|    |                                    | your application and its behavior. In the cloud, |
|    |                                    | you don’t. Make sure your design includes the    |
|    |                                    | collection of monitoring, domain-specific, and   |
|    |                                    | health/system data.                              |
|  3 | 15 - Authentication/ Authorization | Implement identity from the start. Consider      |
|    |                                    | RBAC (role-based access control) features        |
|    |                                    | available in public clouds.                      |
