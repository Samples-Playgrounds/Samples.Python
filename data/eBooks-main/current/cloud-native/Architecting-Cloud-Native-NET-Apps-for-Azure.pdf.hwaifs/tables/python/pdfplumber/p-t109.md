|  0 | Consider a NoSQL datastore when:                 | Consider a relational database when:                |
|  1 | You have high volume workloads that require      | Your workload volume generally fits within          |
|    | predictable latency at large scale (for example, | thousands of transactions per second                |
|    | latency measured in milliseconds while           |                                                     |
|    | performing millions of transactions per second)  |                                                     |
|  2 | Your data is dynamic and frequently changes      | Your data is highly structured and requires         |
|    |                                                  | referential integrity                               |
|  3 | Relationships can be de-normalized data          | Relationships are expressed through table joins     |
|    | models                                           | on normalized data models                           |
|  4 | Data retrieval is simple and expressed without   | You work with complex queries and reports           |
|    | table joins                                      |                                                     |
|  5 | Data is typically replicated across geographies  | Data is typically centralized, or can be replicated |
|    | and requires finer control over consistency,     | regions asynchronously                              |
|    | availability, and performance                    |                                                     |
