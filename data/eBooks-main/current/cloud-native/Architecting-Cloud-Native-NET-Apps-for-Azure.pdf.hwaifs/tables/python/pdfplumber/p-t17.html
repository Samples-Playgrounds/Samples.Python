      <th>1</th>
      <td>5 - Build, Release, Run</td>
      <td>Each release must enforce a strict separation\nacross the build, release, and run stages. Each\nshould be tagged with a unique ID and support\nthe ability to roll back. Modern CI/CD systems\nhelp fulfill this principle.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>6 - Processes</td>
      <td>Each microservice should execute in its own\nprocess, isolated from other running services.\nExternalize required state to a backing service\nsuch as a distributed cache or data store.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>7 - Port Binding</td>
      <td>Each microservice should be self-contained with\nits interfaces and functionality exposed on its\nown port. Doing so provides isolation from\nother microservices.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>8 - Concurrency</td>
      <td>When capacity needs to increase, scale out\nservices horizontally across multiple identical\nprocesses (copies) as opposed to scaling-up a\nsingle large instance on the most powerful\nmachine available. Develop the application to be\nconcurrent making scaling out in cloud\nenvironments seamless.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>9 - Disposability</td>
      <td>Service instances should be disposable. Favor\nfast startup to increase scalability opportunities\nand graceful shutdowns to leave the system in a\ncorrect state. Docker containers along with an\norchestrator inherently satisfy this requirement.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>6</th>
      <td>10 - Dev/Prod Parity</td>
      <td>Keep environments across the application\nlifecycle as similar as possible, avoiding costly\nshortcuts. Here, the adoption of containers can\ngreatly contribute by promoting the same\nexecution environment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>7</th>
      <td>11 - Logging</td>
      <td>Treat logs generated by microservices as event\nstreams. Process them with an event\naggregator. Propagate log data to data-\nmining/log management tools like Azure\nMonitor or Splunk and eventually to long-term\narchival.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>8</th>
      <td>12 - Admin Processes</td>
      <td>Run administrative/management tasks, such as\ndata cleanup or computing analytics, as one-off\nprocesses. Use independent tools to invoke\nthese tasks from the production environment,\nbut separately from the application.</td>
