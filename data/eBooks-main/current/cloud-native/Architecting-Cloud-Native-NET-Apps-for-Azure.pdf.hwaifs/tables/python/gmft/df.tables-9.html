      <td>1 - Code Base</td>
      <td>A single code base for each microservice, stored in its own repository. Tracked with version control, it can deploy to multiple environments (QA, Staging, Production).</td>

      <th>1</th>
      <td>2 - Dependencies</td>
      <td>Each microservice isolates and packages its own dependencies, embracing changes without impacting the entire system.</td>

      <th>2</th>
      <td>3 - Configurations</td>
      <td>Configuration information is moved out of the microservice and externalized through a configuration management tool outside of the code. The same deployment can propagate across environments with the correct configuration applied.</td>

      <th>3</th>
      <td>4 - Backing Services</td>
      <td>Ancillary resources (data stores, caches, message brokers) should be exposed via an addressable URL. Doing so decouples the resource from the application, enabling it to be interchangeable.</td>
