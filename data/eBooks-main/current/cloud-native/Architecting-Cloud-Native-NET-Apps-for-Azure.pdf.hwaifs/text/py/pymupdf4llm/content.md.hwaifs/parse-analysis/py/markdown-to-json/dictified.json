Cloud-native foundational pillars_\n\nLet\u2019s take some time to better understand the significance of each pillar.", "**The cloud**": "Cloud-native systems take full advantage of the cloud service model.\n\nDesigned to thrive in a dynamic, virtualized cloud environment, these systems make extensive use of\n[Platform as a Service (PaaS) compute infrastructure and managed services. They treat the underlying](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas/)\ninfrastructure as _disposable_ - provisioned in minutes and resized, scaled, or destroyed on demand \u2013\nvia automation.\n\n[Consider the widely accepted DevOps concept of Pets vs. Cattle. In a traditional data center, servers](https://medium.com/@Joachim8675309/devops-concepts-pets-vs-cattle-2380b5aab313)\nare treated as _Pets_ : a physical machine, given a meaningful name, and _cared_ for. You scale by adding\nmore resources to the same machine (scaling up). If the server becomes sick, you nurse it back to\nhealth. Should the server become unavailable, everyone notices.\n\nThe _Cattle_ service model is different. You provision each instance as a virtual machine or container.\nThey\u2019re identical and assigned a system identifier such as Service-01, Service-02, and so on.

What would your architecture look like? To what\nprinciples, patterns, and best practices would you adhere? What infrastructure and operational\nconcerns would be important?\n\n**The Twelve-Factor Application**\n\n[A widely accepted methodology for constructing cloud-based applications is the Twelve-Factor](https://12factor.net/)\n[Application. It describes a set of principles and practices that developers follow to construct](https://12factor.net/)\napplications optimized for modern cloud environments. Special attention is given to portability across\nenvironments and declarative automation.\n\nWhile applicable to any web-based application, many practitioners consider Twelve-Factor a solid\nfoundation for building cloud-native apps. Systems built upon these principles can deploy and scale\nrapidly and add features to react quickly to market changes.\n\nThe following table highlights the Twelve-Factor methodology:\n\n|Factor|Explanation|\n|---|---|\n|1 - Code Base|A single code base for each microservice, stored<br>in its own repository. Tracked with version<br>control, it can deploy to multiple environments<br>(QA, Staging, Production).|\n|2 - Dependencies|Each microservice isolates and packages its own<br>dependencies, embracing changes without<br>impacting the entire system.|\n|3 - Configurations|Configuration information is moved out of the<br>microservice and externalized through a<br>configuration management tool outside of the<br>code. The same deployment can propagate<br>across environments with the correct<br>configuration applied.|\n|4 - Backing Services|Ancillary resources (data stores, caches,<br>message brokers) should be exposed via an<br>addressable URL. Doing so decouples the<br>resource from the application, enabling it to be<br>interchangeable.|\n\n6 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\n|Factor|Explanation|\n|---|---|\n|5 - Build, Release, Run|Each release must enforce a strict separation<br>across the build, release, and run stages. Each<br>should be tagged with a unique ID and support<br>the ability to roll back. Modern CI/CD systems<br>help fulfill this principle.|\n|6 - Processes|Each microservice should execute in its own<br>process, isolated from other running services.<br>Externalize required state to a backing service<br>such as a distributed cache or data store.|\n|7 - Port Binding|Each microservice should be self-contained with<br>its interfaces and functionality exposed on its<br>own port. Doing so provides isolation from<br>other microservices.|\n|8 - Concurrency|When capacity needs to increase, scale out<br>services horizontally across multiple identical<br>processes (copies) as opposed to scaling-up a<br>single large instance on the most powerful<br>machine available. Develop the application to be<br>concurrent making scaling out in cloud<br>environments seamless.|\n|9 - Disposability|Service instances should be disposable. Favor<br>fast startup to increase scalability opportunities<br>and graceful shutdowns to leave the system in a<br>correct state. Docker containers along with an<br>orchestrator inherently satisfy this requirement.|\n|10 - Dev/Prod Parity|Keep environments across the application<br>lifecycle as similar as possible, avoiding costly<br>shortcuts. Here, the adoption of containers can<br>greatly contribute by promoting the same<br>execution environment.|\n|11 - Logging|Treat logs generated by microservices as event<br>streams. Process them with an event<br>aggregator. Propagate log data to data-<br>mining/log management tools like Azure<br>Monitor or Splunk and eventually to long-term<br>archival.|\n|12 - Admin Processes|Run administrative/management tasks, such as<br>data cleanup or computing analytics, as one-off<br>processes. Use independent tools to invoke<br>these tasks from the production environment,<br>but separately from the application.|\n\n7 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\n[In the book, Beyond the Twelve-Factor App, author Kevin Hoffman details each of the original 12](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/beyond-the-twelve-factor-app)\nfactors (written in 2011).

In the cloud,<br>you don\u2019t. Make sure your design includes the<br>collection of monitoring, domain-specific, and<br>health/system data.|\n|15 - Authentication/ Authorization|Implement identity from the start.

Microsoft provides industry standard best practices to help you and your\nteam deliver robust cloud solutions.\n\n[The Microsoft Well-Architected Framework provides a set of guiding tenets that can be used to](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/)\nimprove the quality of a cloud-native workload. The framework consists of five pillars of architecture\n\n|excellence:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|**Tenets**|**Description**|\n|Cost management|Focus on generating incremental value early.<br>Apply_Build-Measure-Learn_ principles to<br>accelerate time to market while avoiding<br>capital-intensive solutions.

Pay close<br>attention to identity management, infrastructure<br>access, application security, and data<br>sovereignty and encryption.|\n\n[To get started, Microsoft provides a set of online assessments](https://docs.microsoft.com/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&session=local) to help you assess your current cloud\nworkloads against the five well-architected pillars.", "**Microservices**": "Cloud-native systems embrace microservices, a popular architectural style for constructing modern\napplications.\n\nBuilt as a distributed set of small, independent services that interact through a shared fabric,\nmicroservices share the following characteristics:\n\n['Each implements a specific business capability within a larger domain context.']\n\n['Each is developed autonomously and can be deployed independently.']\n\n['Each is self-contained encapsulating its own data storage technology, dependencies, and\\nprogramming platform.']\n\n['Each runs in its own process and communicates with others using standard communication\\n[protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, gRPC, WebSockets, or AMQP.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol)']\n\n['They compose together to form an application.']\n\nFigure 1-4 contrasts a monolithic application approach with a microservices approach. Note how the\nmonolith is composed of a layered architecture, which executes in a single process. It typically\nconsumes a relational database. The microservice approach, however, segregates functionality into\nindependent services, each with its own logic, state, and data. Each microservice hosts its own\ndatastore.\n\n9 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\n_Figure 1-4. Monolithic versus microservices architecture_\n\nNote how microservices promote the **Processes** [principle from the Twelve-Factor Application,](https://12factor.net/)\ndiscussed earlier in the chapter.\n\n_Factor #6 specifies \u201cEach microservice should execute in its own process, isolated from other running_\n_services.\u201d_\n\n**Why microservices?**\n\nMicroservices provide agility.\n\nEarlier in the chapter, we compared an eCommerce application built as a monolith to that with\nmicroservices. In the example, we saw some clear benefits:\n\n['Each microservice has an autonomous lifecycle and can evolve independently and deploy\\nfrequently. You don\u2019t have to wait for a quarterly release to deploy a new feature or update.\\nYou can update a small area of a live application with less risk of disrupting the entire system.\\nThe update can be made without a full redeployment of the application.']\n\n['Each microservice can scale independently. Instead of scaling the entire application as a single\\nunit, you scale out only those services that require more processing power to meet desired\\nperformance levels and service-level agreements. Fine-grained scaling provides for greater\\ncontrol of your system and helps reduce overall costs as you scale portions of your system,\\nnot everything.']\n\n[An excellent reference guide for understanding microservices is .NET Microservices: Architecture for](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/microservices-architecture-ebook)\n[Containerized .NET Applications. The book deep dives into microservices design and architecture.

Free and open source, it has many built-in features\nthat simplify microservice development. .NET is cross-platform. Applications can be built and run on\nWindows, macOS, and most flavors of Linux.\n\n.NET is highly performant and has scored well in comparison to Node.js and other competing\n[platforms. Interestingly, TechEmpower conducted an extensive set of performance benchmarks across](https://www.techempower.com/)\nmany web application platforms and frameworks. .NET scored in the top 10 - well above Node.js and\nother competing platforms.\n\n[.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core) is maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub.\n\n**Microservice challenges**\n\nWhile distributed cloud-native microservices can provide immense agility and speed, they present\nmany challenges:\n\n_**Communication**_\n\nHow will front-end client applications communicate with backed-end core microservices? Will you\nallow direct communication? Or, might you abstract the back-end microservices with a gateway\nfacade that provides flexibility, control, and security?\n\nHow will back-end core microservices communicate with each other? Will you allow direct HTTP calls\nthat can increase coupling and impact performance and agility? Or might you consider decoupled\nmessaging with queue and topic technologies?\n\nCommunication is covered in the Cloud-native communication patterns chapter.\n\n_**Resiliency**_\n\nA microservices architecture moves your system from in-process to out-of-process network\ncommunication. In a distributed architecture, what happens when Service B isn\u2019t responding to a\nnetwork call from Service A? Or, what happens when Service C becomes temporarily unavailable and\nother services calling it become blocked?\n\nResiliency is covered in the Cloud-native resiliency chapter.\n\n_**Distributed Data**_\n\nBy design, each microservice encapsulates its own data, exposing operations via its public interface. If\nso, how do you query data or implement a transaction across multiple services?\n\nDistributed data is covered in the Cloud-native data patterns chapter.\n\n_**Secrets**_\n\nHow will your microservices securely store and manage secrets and sensitive configuration data?\n\nSecrets are covered in detail Cloud-native security.\n\n11 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\n**Manage Complexity with Dapr**\n\n[Dapr](https://dapr.io/) is a distributed, open-source application runtime. Through an architecture of pluggable\ncomponents, it dramatically simplifies the _plumbing_ behind distributed applications. It provides a\n**dynamic glue** that binds your application with pre-built infrastructure capabilities and components\nfrom the Dapr runtime. Figure 1-5 shows Dapr from 20,000 feet.\n\n_Figure 1-5. Dapr at 20,000 feet._\n\n[In the top row of the figure, note how Dapr provides language-specific SDKs for popular development](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/)\nplatforms. Dapr v1 includes support for .NET, Go, Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, and JavaScript.\n\nWhile language-specific SDKs enhance the developer experience, Dapr is platform agnostic. Under the\nhood, Dapr\u2019s programming model exposes capabilities through standard HTTP/gRPC communication\nprotocols. Any programming platform can call Dapr via its native HTTP and gRPC APIs.\n\nThe blue boxes across the center of the figure represent the Dapr building blocks. Each exposes prebuilt plumbing code for a distributed application capability that your application can consume.\n\nThe components row represents a large set of pre-defined infrastructure components that your\napplication can consume. Think of components as infrastructure code you don\u2019t have to write.\n\nThe bottom row highlights the portability of Dapr and the diverse environments across which it can\nrun.\n\n[Microsoft features a free ebook Dapr for .NET Developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/dapr-for-net-developers/) for learning Dapr.\n\nLooking ahead, Dapr has the potential to have a profound impact on cloud-native application\ndevelopment.", "**Containers**": "It\u2019s natural to hear the term _container_ mentioned in any _cloud native_ [conversation. In the book, Cloud](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-patterns)\n[Native Patterns, author Cornelia Davis observes that, \u201cContainers are a great enabler of cloud-native](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-patterns)\n\n12 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\nsoftware.\u201d The Cloud Native Computing Foundation places microservice containerization as the first\n[step in their Cloud-Native Trail Map - guidance for enterprises beginning their cloud-native journey.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/trailmap/master/CNCF_TrailMap_latest.png)\n\nContainerizing a microservice is simple and straightforward. The code, its dependencies, and runtime\n[are packaged into a binary called a container image. Images are stored in a container registry, which](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=image)\nacts as a repository or library for images. A registry can be located on your development computer, in\n[your data center, or in a public cloud. Docker itself maintains a public registry via Docker Hub. The](https://hub.docker.com/)\n[Azure cloud features a private container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/) to store container images close to the cloud\napplications that will run them.\n\nWhen an application starts or scales, you transform the container image into a running container\n[instance. The instance runs on any computer that has a container runtime](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/) engine installed. You can\nhave as many instances of the containerized service as needed.\n\nFigure 1-6 shows three different microservices, each in its own container, all running on a single host.\n\n_Figure 1-6. Multiple containers running on a container host_\n\nNote how each container maintains its own set of dependencies and runtime, which can be different\nfrom one another. Here, we see different versions of the Product microservice running on the same\nhost. Each container shares a slice of the underlying host operating system, memory, and processor,\nbut is isolated from one another.\n\nNote how well the container model embraces the **Dependencies** [principle from the Twelve-Factor](https://12factor.net/)\n[Application.](https://12factor.net/)\n\n_Factor #2 specifies that \u201cEach microservice isolates and packages its own dependencies, embracing_\n_changes without impacting the entire system.\u201d_\n\nContainers support both Linux and Windows workloads. The Azure cloud openly embraces both.\nInterestingly, it\u2019s Linux, not Windows Server, that has become the more popular operating system in\nAzure.\n\n13 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\n[While several container vendors exist, Docker](https://www.docker.com/) has captured the lion\u2019s share of the market. The\ncompany has been driving the software container movement. It has become the de facto standard for\npackaging, deploying, and running cloud-native applications.\n\n**Why containers?**\n\nContainers provide portability and guarantee consistency across environments. By encapsulating\neverything into a single package, you _isolate_ the microservice and its dependencies from the\nunderlying infrastructure.\n\nYou can deploy the container in any environment that hosts the Docker runtime engine. Containerized\nworkloads also eliminate the expense of pre-configuring each environment with frameworks, software\nlibraries, and runtime engines.\n\nBy sharing the underlying operating system and host resources, a container has a much smaller\nfootprint than a full virtual machine. The smaller size increases the _density_, or number of\nmicroservices, that a given host can run at one time.\n\n**Container orchestration**\n\nWhile tools such as Docker create images and run containers, you also need tools to manage them.\nContainer management is done with a special software program called a **container orchestrator** .\nWhen operating at scale with many independent running containers, orchestration is essential.\n\nFigure 1-7 shows management tasks that container orchestrators automate.\n\n_Figure 1-7. What container orchestrators do_\n\nThe following table describes common orchestration tasks.\n\n|Tasks|Explanation|\n|---|---|\n|Scheduling|Automatically provision container instances.|\n|Affinity/anti-affinity|Provision containers nearby or far apart from<br>each other, helping availability and<br>performance.|\n|Health monitoring|Automatically detect and correct failures.|\n|Failover|Automatically reprovision a failed instance to a<br>healthy machine.|\n\n14 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\n|Tasks|Explanation|\n|---|---|\n|Scaling|Automatically add or remove a container<br>instance to meet demand.|\n|Networking|Manage a networking overlay for container<br>communication.|\n|Service Discovery|Enable containers to locate each other.|\n|Rolling Upgrades|Coordinate incremental upgrades with zero<br>downtime deployment. Automatically roll back<br>problematic changes.|\n\nNote how container orchestrators embrace the **Disposability** and **Concurrency** principles from the\n[Twelve-Factor Application.](https://12factor.net/)\n\n_Factor #9 specifies that \u201cService instances should be disposable, favoring fast startups to increase_\n_scalability opportunities and graceful shutdowns to leave the system in a correct state.\u201d_ Docker\ncontainers along with an orchestrator inherently satisfy this requirement.\u201d\n\n_Factor #8 specifies that \u201cServices scale out across a large number of small identical processes (copies) as_\n_opposed to scaling-up a single large instance on the most powerful machine available.\u201d_\n\n[While several container orchestrators exist, Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) has become the de facto standard for the\ncloud-native world. It\u2019s a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized\nworkloads.\n\nYou could host your own instance of Kubernetes, but then you\u2019d be responsible for provisioning and\nmanaging its resources - which can be complex. The Azure cloud features Kubernetes as a managed\n[service. Both Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/) enable you to fully\nleverage the features and power of Kubernetes as a managed service, without having to install and\nmaintain it.\n\nContainer orchestration is covered in detail in Scaling Cloud-Native Applications.", "**Backing services**": "Cloud-native systems depend upon many different ancillary resources, such as data stores, message\n[brokers, monitoring, and identity services. These services are known as backing services.](https://12factor.net/backing-services)\n\nFigure 1-8 shows many common backing services that cloud-native systems consume.\n\n15 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\n_Figure 1-8. Common backing services_\n\nYou could host your own backing services, but then you\u2019d be responsible for licensing, provisioning,\nand managing those resources.\n\nCloud providers offer a rich assortment of _managed backing services._ Instead of owning the service,\nyou simply consume it. The cloud provider operates the resource at scale and bears the responsibility\nfor performance, security, and maintenance. Monitoring, redundancy, and availability are built into the\nservice. Providers guarantee service level performance and fully support their managed services open a ticket and they fix your issue.\n\nCloud-native systems favor managed backing services from cloud vendors. The savings in time and\nlabor can be significant. The operational risk of hosting your own and experiencing trouble can get\nexpensive fast.\n\nA best practice is to treat a backing service as an **attached resource**, dynamically bound to a\nmicroservice with configuration information (a URL and credentials) stored in an external\n[configuration. This guidance is spelled out in the Twelve-Factor Application, discussed earlier in the](https://12factor.net/)\nchapter.\n\n_Factor #4_ specifies that backing services \u201cshould be exposed via an addressable URL. Doing so\ndecouples the resource from the application, enabling it to be interchangeable.\u201d\n\n_Factor #3_ specifies that \u201cConfiguration information is moved out of the microservice and externalized\nthrough a configuration management tool outside of the code.\u201d\n\nWith this pattern, a backing service can be attached and detached without code changes. You might\npromote a microservice from QA to a staging environment. You update the microservice\nconfiguration to point to the backing services in staging and inject the settings into your container\nthrough an environment variable.\n\n16 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\nCloud vendors provide APIs for you to communicate with their proprietary backing services. These\nlibraries encapsulate the proprietary plumbing and complexity. However, communicating directly with\nthese APIs will tightly couple your code to that specific backing service. It\u2019s a widely accepted practice\nto insulate the implementation details of the vendor API. Introduce an intermediation layer, or\nintermediate API, exposing generic operations to your service code and wrap the vendor code inside\nit. This loose coupling enables you to swap out one backing service for another or move your code to\na different cloud environment without having to make changes to the mainline service code. Dapr,\n[discussed earlier, follows this model with its set of prebuilt building blocks.](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/)\n\nOn a final thought, backing services also promote the **Statelessness** [principle from the Twelve-Factor](https://12factor.net/)\n[Application, discussed earlier in the chapter.](https://12factor.net/)\n\n_Factor #6_ specifies that, \u201cEach microservice should execute in its own process, isolated from other\nrunning services. Externalize required state to a backing service such as a distributed cache or data\nstore.\u201d\n\nBacking services are discussed in Cloud-native data patterns and Cloud-native communication\npatterns.", "**Automation**": "As you\u2019ve seen, cloud-native systems embrace microservices, containers, and modern system design\nto achieve speed and agility. But, that\u2019s only part of the story. How do you provision the cloud\nenvironments upon which these systems run? How do you rapidly deploy app features and updates?\nHow do you round out the full picture?\n\n[Enter the widely accepted practice of Infrastructure as Code, or IaC.](https://docs.microsoft.com/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)\n\nWith IaC, you automate platform provisioning and application deployment. You essentially apply\nsoftware engineering practices such as testing and versioning to your DevOps practices. Your\ninfrastructure and deployments are automated, consistent, and repeatable.\n\n**Automating infrastructure**\n\n[Tools like Azure Resource Manager, Azure Bicep,](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) [from HashiCorp, and the Azure CLI, enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/)\nyou to declaratively script the cloud infrastructure you require. Resource names, locations, capacities,\nand secrets are parameterized and dynamic. The script is versioned and checked into source control\nas an artifact of your project. You invoke the script to provision a consistent and repeatable\ninfrastructure across system environments, such as QA, staging, and production.\n\nUnder the hood, IaC is idempotent, meaning that you can run the same script over and over without\nside effects. If the team needs to make a change, they edit and rerun the script. Only the updated\nresources are affected.\n\n[In the article, What is Infrastructure as Code, Author Sam Guckenheimer describes how, \u201cTeams who](https://docs.microsoft.com/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)\nimplement IaC can deliver stable environments rapidly and at scale. They avoid manual configuration\nof environments and enforce consistency by representing the desired state of their environments via\ncode. Infrastructure deployments with IaC are repeatable and prevent runtime issues caused by\nconfiguration drift or missing dependencies. DevOps teams can work together with a unified set of\n\n17 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\npractices and tools to deliver applications and their supporting infrastructure rapidly, reliably, and at\nscale.\u201d\n\n**Automating deployments**\n\n[The Twelve-Factor Application, discussed earlier, calls for separate steps when transforming](https://12factor.net/)\ncompleted code into a running application.\n\n_Factor #5_ specifies that \u201cEach release must enforce a strict separation across the build, release and run\nstages. Each should be tagged with a unique ID and support the ability to roll back.\u201d\n\nModern CI/CD systems help fulfill this principle. They provide separate build and delivery steps that\nhelp ensure consistent and quality code that\u2019s readily available to users.\n\nFigure 1-9 shows the separation across the deployment process.\n\n_Figure 1-9. Deployment steps in a CI/CD Pipeline_\n\nIn the previous figure, pay special attention to separation of tasks:\n\n['The developer constructs a feature in their development environment, iterating through what\\nis called the \u201cinner loop\u201d of code, run, and debug.', 'When complete, that code is _pushed_ into a code repository, such as GitHub, Azure DevOps, or\\nBitBucket.', 'The push triggers a build stage that transforms the code into a binary artifact.

Releases are\\nimmutable meaning that any change must create a new release.']\n\nApplying these practices, organizations have radically evolved how they ship software. Many have\nmoved from quarterly releases to on-demand updates. The goal is to catch problems early in the\ndevelopment cycle when they\u2019re less expensive to fix. The longer the duration between integrations,\nthe more expensive problems become to resolve.

Here, the on-premises workload is rehosted to a cloud-based VM, without changes.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/modernize-with-azure-containers/lift-and-shift-existing-apps-azure-iaas)\n[This approach uses the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) model. Azure includes several tools such as](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-iaas/)\n[Azure Migrate,](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-migrate/) [Azure Site Recovery, and Azure Database Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery/) to help streamline the\nmove. While this strategy can yield some cost savings, such applications typically weren\u2019t designed to\nunlock and leverage the benefits of cloud computing.\n\nLegacy apps that are critical to the business often benefit from an enhanced **Cloud Optimized**\nmigration. This approach includes deployment optimizations that enable key cloud services - without\n[changing the core architecture of the application. For example, you might containerize the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/)\n[and deploy it to a container orchestrator, like Azure Kubernetes Services, discussed later in this book.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/)\nOnce in the cloud, the application can consume cloud backing services such as databases, message\nqueues, monitoring, and distributed caching.\n\nFinally, monolithic apps that provide strategic enterprise functions might best benefit from a _Cloud-_\n_Native_ approach, the subject of this book. This approach provides agility and velocity. But, it comes at\na cost of replatforming, rearchitecting, and rewriting code. Over time, a legacy application could be\ndecomposed into microservices, containerized, and ultimately _replatformed_ into a cloud-native\narchitecture.\n\nIf you and your team believe a cloud-native approach is appropriate, it behooves you to rationalize\nthe decision with your organization. What exactly is the business problem that a cloud-native\napproach will solve? How would it align with business needs?\n\n['Rapid releases of features with increased confidence?']\n\n['Fine-grained scalability - more efficient usage of resources?']\n\n20 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to cloud-native applications\n\n['Improved system resiliency?']\n\n['Improved system performance?']\n\n['More visibility into operations?']\n\n['Blend development platforms and data stores to arrive at the best tool for the job?']\n\n['Future-proof application investment?']\n\nThe right migration strategy depends on organizational priorities and the systems you\u2019re targeting.\nFor many, it may be more cost effective to cloud-optimize a monolithic application or add coarsegrained services to an N-Tier app. In these cases, you can still make full use of cloud PaaS capabilities\nlike the ones offered by Azure App Service.", "**Summary**": "In this chapter, we introduced cloud-native computing. We provided a definition along with the key\ncapabilities that drive a cloud-native application.

The eShopOnContainers\napplication represents an online store that sells various physical products like t-shirts and coffee\nmugs. If you\u2019ve bought anything online before, the experience of using the store should be relatively\nfamiliar. Here are some of the basic features the store implements:\n\n['List catalog items', 'Filter items by type', 'Filter items by brand', 'Add items to the shopping basket', 'Edit or remove items from the basket', 'Checkout', 'Register an account', 'Sign in', 'Sign out', 'Review orders']\n\nThe application also has the following non-functional requirements:\n\n['It needs to be highly available and it must scale automatically to meet increased traffic (and\\nscale back down once traffic subsides).', 'It should provide easy-to-use monitoring of its health and diagnostic logs to help\\ntroubleshoot any issues it encounters.', 'It should support an agile development process, including support for continuous integration\\nand deployment (CI/CD).', 'In addition to the two web front ends (traditional and Single Page Application), the\\napplication must also support mobile client apps running different kinds of operating\\nsystems.', 'It should support cross-platform hosting and cross-platform development.']\n\n23 CHAPTER 2 | Introducing eShopOnContainers reference app\n\n_Figure 2-2. eShopOnContainers reference application development architecture._\n\nThe eShopOnContainers application is accessible from web or mobile clients that access the\napplication over HTTPS targeting either the ASP.NET Core MVC server application or an appropriate\nAPI Gateway. API Gateways offer several advantages, such as decoupling back-end services from\nindividual front-end clients and providing better security. The application also makes use of a related\npattern known as Backends-for-Frontends (BFF), which recommends creating separate API gateways\nfor each front-end client. The reference architecture demonstrates breaking up the API gateways\nbased on whether the request is coming from a web or mobile client.\n\nThe application\u2019s functionality is broken up into many distinct microservices. There are services\nresponsible for authentication and identity, listing items from the product catalog, managing users\u2019\nshopping baskets, and placing orders. Each of these separate services has its own persistent storage.\nThere\u2019s no single primary data store with which all services interact. Instead, coordination and\ncommunication between the services is done on an as-needed basis and by using a message bus.\n\nEach of the different microservices is designed differently, based on their individual requirements. This\naspect means their technology stack may differ, although they\u2019re all built using .NET and designed for\nthe cloud. Simpler services provide basic Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) access to the underlying\ndata stores, while more advanced services use Domain-Driven Design approaches and patterns to\nmanage business complexity.\n\n24 CHAPTER 2 | Introducing eShopOnContainers reference app\n\n_Figure 2-3. Different kinds of microservices._", "Overview of the code": "Because it uses microservices, the eShopOnContainers app includes quite a few separate projects and\nsolutions in its GitHub repository. In addition to separate solutions and executable files, the various\nservices are designed to run inside their own containers, both during local development and at run\ntime in production. Figure 2-4 shows the full Visual Studio solution, in which the various different\nprojects are organized.\n\n25 CHAPTER 2 | Introducing eShopOnContainers reference app\n\n26 CHAPTER 2 | Introducing eShopOnContainers reference app\n\n_Figure 2-4. Projects in Visual Studio solution._\n\nThe code is organized to support the different microservices, and within each microservice, the code is\nbroken up into domain logic, infrastructure concerns, and user interface or service endpoint. In many\ncases, each service\u2019s dependencies can be fulfilled by Azure services in production, and alternative\noptions for local development. Let\u2019s examine how the application\u2019s requirements map to Azure\nservices.", "Understanding microservices": "This book focuses on cloud-native applications built using Azure technology. To learn more about\nmicroservices best practices and how to architect microservice-based applications, read the\n[companion book, .NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/microservices-architecture-ebook)", "Mapping eShopOnContainers to Azure Services": {"**Container orchestration and clustering**": "The application\u2019s container-hosted services, from ASP.NET Core MVC apps to individual Catalog and\nOrdering microservices, can be hosted and managed in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The\napplication can run locally on Docker and Kubernetes, and the same containers can then be deployed\nto staging and production environments hosted in AKS. This process can be automated as we\u2019ll see in\nthe next section.\n\nAKS provides management services for individual clusters of containers. The application will deploy\nseparate containers for each microservice in the AKS cluster, as shown in the architecture diagram\nabove. This approach allows each individual service to scale independently according to its resource\ndemands. Each microservice can also be deployed independently, and ideally such deployments\nshould incur zero system downtime.", "**API Gateway**": "The eShopOnContainers application has multiple front-end clients and multiple different back-end\nservices. There\u2019s no one-to-one correspondence between the client applications and the microservices\nthat support them. In such a scenario, there may be a great deal of complexity when writing client\nsoftware to interface with the various back-end services in a secure manner. Each client would need to\naddress this complexity on its own, resulting in duplication and many places in which to make updates\nas services change or new policies are implemented.\n\nAzure API Management (APIM) helps organizations publish APIs in a consistent, manageable fashion.\nAPIM consists of three components: the API Gateway, and administration portal (the Azure portal),\nand a developer portal.\n\n28 CHAPTER 2 | Introducing eShopOnContainers reference app\n\nThe API Gateway accepts API calls and routes them to the appropriate back-end API. It can also\nprovide additional services like verification of API keys or JWT tokens and API transformation on the\nfly without code modifications (for instance, to accommodate clients expecting an older interface).\n\nThe Azure portal is where you define the API schema and package different APIs into products. You\nalso configure user access, view reports, and configure policies for quotas or transformations.\n\nThe developer portal serves as the main resource for developers. It provides developers with API\ndocumentation, an interactive test console, and reports on their own usage. Developers also use the\nportal to create and manage their own accounts, including subscription and API key support.\n\nUsing APIM, applications can expose several different groups of services, each providing a back end\nfor a particular front-end client. APIM is recommended for complex scenarios. For simpler needs, the\nlightweight API Gateway Ocelot can be used. The eShopOnContainers app uses Ocelot because of its\nsimplicity and because it can be deployed into the same application environment as the application\n[itself.

This approach allows your cluster to integrate with an Azure Application\n[Gateway, allowing the gateway to load-balance traffic to the AKS pods. Learn more about the Azure](https://github.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress)\n[Gateway Ingress Controller for AKS.](https://github.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress)", "**Data**": "The various back-end services used by eShopOnContainers have different storage requirements.\nSeveral microservices use SQL Server databases. The Basket microservice leverages a Redis cache for\nits persistence. The Locations microservice expects a MongoDB API for its data. Azure supports each\nof these data formats.\n\nFor SQL Server database support, Azure has products for everything from single databases up to\nhighly scalable SQL Database elastic pools. Individual microservices can be configured to\ncommunicate with their own individual SQL Server databases quickly and easily. These databases can\nbe scaled as needed to support each separate microservice according to its needs.\n\nThe eShopOnContainers application stores the user\u2019s current shopping basket between requests. This\naspect is managed by the Basket microservice that stores the data in a Redis cache. In development,\nthis cache can be deployed in a container, while in production it can utilize Azure Cache for Redis.\nAzure Cache for Redis is a fully managed service offering high performance and reliability without the\nneed to deploy and manage Redis instances or containers on your own.\n\nThe Locations microservice uses a MongoDB NoSQL database for its persistence. During\ndevelopment, the database can be deployed in its own container, while in production the service can\n[leverage Azure Cosmos DB\u2019s API for MongoDB. One of the benefits of Azure Cosmos DB is its ability](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-introduction)\nto leverage multiple different communication protocols, including a SQL API and common NoSQL\nAPIs including MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, and Azure Table Storage. Azure Cosmos DB offers a\nfully managed and globally distributed database as a service that can scale to meet the needs of the\nservices that use it.\n\nDistributed data in cloud-native applications is covered in more detail in chapter 5.\n\n29 CHAPTER 2 | Introducing eShopOnContainers reference app", "**Event Bus**": "The application uses events to communicate changes between different services. This functionality can\nbe implemented with various implementations, and locally the eShopOnContainers application uses\n[RabbitMQ. When hosted in Azure, the application would leverage Azure Service Bus for its messaging.](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)\nAzure Service Bus is a fully managed integration message broker that allows applications and services\nto communicate with one another in a decoupled, reliable, asynchronous manner. Azure Service Bus\nsupports individual queues as well as separate _topics_ to support publisher-subscriber scenarios. The\neShopOnContainers application would leverage topics with Azure Service Bus to support distributing\nmessages from one microservice to any other microservice that needed to react to a given message.", "**Resiliency**": "Once deployed to production, the eShopOnContainers application would be able to take advantage\nof several Azure services available to improve its resiliency. The application publishes health checks,\nwhich can be integrated with Application Insights to provide reporting and alerts based on the app\u2019s\navailability. Azure resources also provide diagnostic logs that can be used to identify and correct bugs\nand performance issues. Resource logs provide detailed information on when and how different Azure\nresources are used by the application.

To do so, you might use the Azure\nportal, which will walk you through the required steps. You could also create a cluster from the Azure\nCLI, taking care to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and application routing. The\neShopOnContainers\u2019 documentation details the steps for creating your own AKS cluster. Once created,\nyou can access and manage the cluster from the Kubernetes dashboard.\n\nYou can now deploy the eShop application to the cluster using Helm.", "**Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service using Helm**": "Helm is an application package manager tool that works directly with Kubernetes. It helps you define,\ninstall, and upgrade Kubernetes applications. While simple apps can be deployed to AKS with custom\nCLI scripts or simple deployment files, complex apps can contain many Kubernetes objects and benefit\nfrom Helm.\n\nUsing Helm, applications include text-based configuration files, called Helm charts, which declaratively\ndescribe the application and configuration in Helm packages. Charts use standard YAML-formatted\n\n30 CHAPTER 2 | Introducing eShopOnContainers reference app\n\nfiles to describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. They\u2019re versioned alongside the application\ncode they describe. Helm Charts range from simple to complex depending on the requirements of the\ninstallation they describe.\n\nHelm is composed of a command-line client tool, which consumes helm charts and launches\ncommands to a server component named, Tiller. Tiller communicates with the Kubernetes API to\nensure the correct provisioning of your containerized workloads. Helm is maintained by the Cloudnative Computing Foundation.\n\nThe following yaml file presents a Helm template:\n\nNote how the template describes a dynamic set of key/value pairs. When the template is invoked,\nvalues that enclosed in curly braces are pulled in from other yaml-based configuration files.\n\nYou\u2019ll find the eShopOnContainers helm charts in the /k8s/helm folder.

The point-intime snapshot feature enables you to reconstruct the history of a setting and even rollback for a failed\ndeployment.\n\nApp Configuration automatically caches each setting to avoid excessive calls to the configuration\nstore.

You can create App Configuration values that\nreference secrets stored in a Key Vault.", "**Azure Key Vault**": "Key Vault is a managed service for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you\nwant to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. A vault is a logical group\nof secrets.\n\nKey Vault greatly reduces the chances that secrets may be accidentally leaked. When using Key Vault,\napplication developers no longer need to store security information in their application. This practice\neliminates the need to store this information inside your code. For example, an application may need\nto connect to a database. Instead of storing the connection string in the app\u2019s code, you can store it\nsecurely in Key Vault.\n\nYour applications can securely access the information they need by using URIs. These URIs allow the\napplications to retrieve specific versions of a secret. There\u2019s no need to write custom code to protect\nany of the secret information stored in Key Vault.\n\nAccess to Key Vault requires proper caller authentication and authorization.

Such applications are referred to\nas a monolith. This general approach of deploying applications as single units even if they\u2019re\ncomposed of multiple modules or assemblies is known as monolithic architecture, as shown in Figure\n3-1.\n\n36 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\n_Figure 3-1. Monolithic architecture._\n\nAlthough they have the benefit of simplicity, monolithic architectures face many challenges:\n\n**Deployment**\n\nAdditionally, they require a restart of the application, which may temporarily impact availability if\nzero-downtime techniques are not applied while deploying.\n\n**Scaling**\n\nA monolithic application is hosted entirely on a single machine instance, often requiring highcapability hardware. If any part of the monolith requires scaling, another copy of the entire application\nmust be deployed to another machine. With a monolith, you can\u2019t scale application components\nindividually - it\u2019s all or nothing. Scaling components that don\u2019t require scaling results in inefficient and\ncostly resource usage.\n\n**Environment**\n\nMonolithic applications are typically deployed to a hosting environment with a pre-installed operating\nsystem, runtime, and library dependencies. This environment may not match that upon which the\napplication was developed or tested. Inconsistencies across application environments are a common\nsource of problems for monolithic deployments.\n\n**Coupling**\n\nA monolithic application is likely to experience high coupling across its functional components.\nWithout hard boundaries, system changes often result in unintended and costly side effects. New\nfeatures/fixes become tricky, time-consuming, and expensive to implement. Updates require extensive\ntesting. Coupling also makes it difficult to refactor components or swap in alternative\nimplementations. Even when constructed with a strict separation of concerns, architectural erosion\nsets in as the monolithic code base deteriorates with never-ending \u201cspecial cases.\u201d\n\n37 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\n**Platform lock-in**\n\nA monolithic application is constructed with a single technology stack. While offering uniformity, this\ncommitment can become a barrier to innovation. New features and components will be built using\nthe application\u2019s current stack - even when more modern technologies may be a better choice. A\nlonger-term risk is your technology stack becoming outdated and obsolete. Rearchitecting an entire\napplication to a new, more modern platform is at best expensive and risky.", "**What are the benefits of containers and orchestrators?**": "We introduced containers in Chapter 1. We highlighted how the Cloud Native Computing Foundation\n[(CNCF) ranks containerization as the first step in their Cloud-Native Trail Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/trailmap/master/CNCF_TrailMap_latest.png) - guidance for\nenterprises beginning their cloud-native journey. In this section, we discuss the benefits of containers.\n\nDocker is the most popular container management platform. It works with containers on both Linux or\nWindows. Containers provide separate but reproducible application environments that run the same\nway on any system. This aspect makes them perfect for developing and hosting cloud-native services.\nContainers are isolated from one another. Two containers on the same host hardware can have\ndifferent versions of software, without causing conflicts.\n\nContainers are defined by simple text-based files that become project artifacts and are checked into\nsource control. While full servers and virtual machines require manual effort to update, containers are\neasily version-controlled. Apps built to run in containers can be developed, tested, and deployed\nusing automated tools as part of a build pipeline.\n\nContainers are immutable. Once you define a container, you can recreate and run it exactly the same\nway. This immutability lends itself to component-based design. If some parts of an application evolve\ndifferently than others, why redeploy the entire app when you can just deploy the parts that change\nmost frequently? Different features and cross-cutting concerns of an app can be broken up into\nseparate units. Figure 3-2 shows how a monolithic app can take advantage of containers and\nmicroservices by delegating certain features or functionality. The remaining functionality in the app\nitself has also been containerized.\n\n38 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\n_Figure 3-2. Decomposing a monolithic app to embrace microservices._\n\nEach cloud-native service is built and deployed in a separate container. Each can update as needed.\nIndividual services can be hosted on nodes with resources appropriate to each service. The\nenvironment each service runs in is immutable, shared across dev, test, and production environments,\nand easily versioned. Coupling between different areas of the application occurs explicitly as calls or\nmessages between services, not compile-time dependencies within the monolith. You can also choose\nthe technology that best suites a given capability without requiring changes to the rest of the app.\n\nContainerized services require automated management. It wouldn\u2019t be feasible to manually administer\na large set of independently deployed containers. For example, consider the following tasks:\n\n['How will container instances be provisioned across a cluster of many machines?', 'Once deployed, how will containers discover and communicate with each other?', 'How can containers scale in or out on-demand?', 'How do you monitor the health of each container?', 'How do you protect a container against hardware and software failures?', 'How do upgrade containers for a live application with zero downtime?']\n\nContainer orchestrators address and automate these and other concerns.\n\nIn the cloud-native eco-system, Kubernetes has become the de facto container orchestrator. It\u2019s an\nopen-source platform managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes\nautomates the deployment, scaling, and operational concerns of containerized workloads across a\nmachine cluster. However, installing and managing Kubernetes is notoriously complex.\n\n39 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\nA much better approach is to leverage Kubernetes as a managed service from a cloud vendor. The\n[Azure cloud features a fully managed Kubernetes platform entitled Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/)\nAKS abstracts the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes. You consume\nKubernetes as a cloud service; Microsoft takes responsibility for managing and supporting it. AKS also\ntightly integrates with other Azure services and dev tools.\n\nAKS is a cluster-based technology. A pool of federated virtual machines, or nodes, is deployed to the\nAzure cloud. Together they form a highly available environment, or cluster. The cluster appears as a\nseamless, single entity to your cloud-native application. Under the hood, AKS deploys your\ncontainerized services across these nodes following a predefined strategy that evenly distributes the\nload.", "**What are the scaling benefits?**": "Services built on containers can leverage scaling benefits provided by orchestration tools like\nKubernetes. By design containers only know about themselves. Once you have multiple containers\nthat need to work together, you should organize them at a higher level. Organizing large numbers of\ncontainers and their shared dependencies, such as network configuration, is where orchestration tools\ncome in to save the day! Kubernetes creates an abstraction layer over groups of containers and\norganizes them into _pods_ . Pods run on worker machines referred to as _nodes_ . This organized structure\nis referred to as a _cluster_ . Figure 3-3 shows the different components of a Kubernetes cluster.\n\n_Figure 3-3. Kubernetes cluster components._\n\nScaling containerized workloads is a key feature of container orchestrators. AKS supports automatic\nscaling across two dimensions: Container instances and compute nodes. Together they give AKS the\nability to quickly and efficiently respond to spikes in demand and add additional resources. We\ndiscuss scaling in AKS later in this chapter.\n\n40 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\n**Declarative versus imperative**\n\nKubernetes supports both declarative and imperative configuration. The imperative approach involves\nrunning various commands that tell Kubernetes what to do each step of the way. Run this image.\nDelete this pod. Expose this port. With the declarative approach, you create a configuration file, called\na manifest, to describe what you want instead of what to do. Kubernetes reads the manifest and\ntransforms your desired end state into actual end state.\n\nImperative commands are great for learning and interactive experimentation. However, you\u2019ll want to\ndeclaratively create Kubernetes manifest files to embrace an infrastructure as code approach,\nproviding for reliable and repeatable deployments. The manifest file becomes a project artifact and is\nused in your CI/CD pipeline for automating Kubernetes deployments.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already configured your cluster using imperative commands, you can export a declarative\nmanifest by using kubectl get svc SERVICENAME -o yaml > service.yaml. This command produces a\nmanifest similar to one shown below:\n\nWhen using declarative configuration, you can preview the changes that will be made before\ncommitting them by using kubectl diff -f FOLDERNAME against the folder where your configuration\nfiles are located. Once you\u2019re sure you want to apply the changes, run kubectl apply -f FOLDERNAME.\nAdd -R to recursively process a folder hierarchy.\n\nYou can also use declarative configuration with other Kubernetes features, one of which being\ndeployments. Declarative deployments help manage releases, updates, and scaling. They instruct the\nKubernetes deployment controller on how to deploy new changes, scale out load, or roll back to a\nprevious revision. If a cluster is unstable, a declarative deployment will automatically return the cluster\nback to a desired state. For example, if a node should crash, the deployment mechanism will redeploy\na replacement to achieve your desired state\n\n41 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\nUsing declarative configuration allows infrastructure to be represented as code that can be checked in\nand versioned alongside the application code.

The use of Kubernetes clusters ensures such apps can also scale on demand and recover\nautomatically from node failures.\n\n**Large numbers of applications**\n\nOrganizations that deploy and maintain large numbers of applications benefit from containers and\norchestrators. The up front effort of setting up containerized environments and Kubernetes clusters is\nprimarily a fixed cost.

While you may work on individual microservices independently, there\nmay be times when you\u2019ll need to run the entire system locally - just as it will run when deployed to\nproduction. There are several tools that can help: Minikube and Docker Desktop. Visual Studio also\nprovides tooling for Docker development.\n\n42 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\n**Minikube**\n\nWhat is Minikube?

Once the cluster is started, you interact\nwith it using the standard Kubernetes kubectl commands.\n\n**Docker Desktop**\n\nYou can also work with Kubernetes directly from Docker Desktop on Windows. It is your only option if\nyou\u2019re using Windows Containers, and is a great choice for non-Windows containers as well. Figure 34 shows how to enable local Kubernetes support when running Docker Desktop.\n\n_Figure 3-4. Configuring Kubernetes in Docker Desktop._\n\n43 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\nDocker Desktop is the most popular tool for configuring and running containerized apps locally.\nWhen you work with Docker Desktop, you can develop locally against the exact same set of Docker\ncontainer images that you\u2019ll deploy to production. Docker Desktop is designed to \u201cbuild, test, and\nship\u201d containerized apps locally. It supports both Linux and Windows containers. Once you push your\nimages to an image registry, like Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub, AKS can pull and deploy\nthem to production.\n\n**Visual Studio Docker Tooling**\n\nVisual Studio supports Docker development for web-based applications. When you create a new\nASP.NET Core application, you have an option to configure it with Docker support, as shown in Figure\n3-5.\n\n_Figure 3-5. Visual Studio Enable Docker Support_\n\nWhen this option is selected, the project is created with a Dockerfile in its root, which can be used to\nbuild and host the app in a Docker container. An example Dockerfile is shown in Figure 3-6.\n\n44 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\n_Figure 3-6. Visual Studio generated Dockerfile_\n\nOnce support is added, you can run your application in a Docker container in Visual Studio. Figure 3-7\nshows the different run options available from a new ASP.NET Core project created with Docker\nsupport added.\n\n_Figure 3-7. Visual Studio Docker Run Options_\n\nAlso, at any time you can add Docker support to an existing ASP.NET Core application. From the\nVisual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Add** - **Docker Support**, as shown\nin Figure 3-8.\n\n45 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\n_Figure 3-8.

The development team increases its productivity by delivering business solutions to\ncustomers, not plumbing.\n\nServerless computing uses event-triggered stateless containers to host your services. They can scale\nout and in to meet demand as-needed. Serverless platforms like Azure Functions have tight\nintegration with other Azure services like queues, events, and storage.", "**What challenges are solved by serverless?**": "Serverless platforms address many time-consuming and expensive concerns:\n\n['Purchasing machines and software licenses', 'Housing, securing, configuring, and maintaining the machines and their networking, power,\\nand A/C requirements', 'Patching and upgrading operating systems and software', 'Configuring web servers or machine services to host application software', 'Configuring application software within its platform']\n\nMany companies allocate large budgets to support hardware infrastructure concerns. Moving to the\ncloud can help reduce these costs; shifting applications to serverless can help eliminate them.", "**What is the difference between a microservice and a serverless** **function?**": "Typically, a microservice encapsulates a business capability, such as a shopping cart for an online\neCommerce site. It exposes multiple operations that enable a user to manage their shopping\nexperience. A function, however, is a small, lightweight block of code that executes a single-purpose\noperation in response to an event. Microservices are typically constructed to respond to requests,\noften from an interface. Requests can be HTTP Rest- or gRPC-based. Serverless services respond to\nevents. Its event-driven architecture is ideal for processing short-running, background tasks.", "**What scenarios are appropriate for serverless?**": "Serverless exposes individual short-running functions that are invoked in response to a trigger. This\nmakes them ideal for processing background tasks.\n\nAn application might need to send an email as a step in a workflow. Instead of sending the\nnotification as part of a microservice request, place the message details onto a queue. An Azure\nFunction can dequeue the message and asynchronously send the email. Doing so could improve the\n[performance and scalability of the microservice. Queue-based load leveling can be implemented to](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/queue-based-load-leveling)\navoid bottlenecks related to sending the emails. Additionally, this stand-alone service could be reused\nas a utility across many different applications.\n\n47 CHAPTER 3 | Scaling cloud-native applications\n\nAsynchronous messaging from queues and topics is a common pattern to trigger serverless functions.\nHowever, Azure Functions can be triggered by other events, such as changes to Azure Blob Storage. A\nservice that supports image uploads could have an Azure Function responsible for optimizing the\nimage size. The function could be triggered directly by inserts into Azure Blob Storage, keeping\ncomplexity out of the microservice operations.\n\nMany services have long-running processes as part of their workflows. Often these tasks are done as\npart of the user\u2019s interaction with the application. These tasks can force the user to wait, negatively\nimpacting their experience.

These tasks can scale with demand without requiring the entire\napplication to scale.", "**When should you avoid serverless?**": "Serverless solutions provision and scale on demand. When a new instance is invoked, cold starts are a\ncommon issue. A cold start is the period of time it takes to provision this instance. Normally, this delay\nmight be a few seconds, but can be longer depending on various factors. Once provisioned, a single\ninstance is kept alive as long as it receives periodic requests. But, if a service is called less frequently,\nAzure may remove it from memory and require a cold start when reinvoked. Cold starts are also\nrequired when a function scales out to a new instance.\n\nFigure 3-9 shows a cold-start pattern. Note the extra steps required when the app is cold.\n\n_Figure 3-9. Cold start versus warm start._\n\n[To avoid cold starts entirely, you might switch from a consumption plan to a dedicated plan.

Long\nrunning operations or high memory consumption workloads aren\u2019t always the best candidates for\nserverless. Serverless functions favor small chunks of work that can complete quickly. Most serverless\nplatforms require individual functions to complete within a few minutes. Azure Functions defaults to a\n5-minute time-out duration, which can be configured up to 10 minutes. The Azure Functions premium\nplan can mitigate this issue as well, defaulting time-outs to 30 minutes with an unbounded higher\nlimit that can be configured. Compute time isn\u2019t calendar time. More advanced functions using the\n[Azure Durable Functions framework may pause execution over a course of several days.

It\u2019s a](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/)\ncloud-based service that not only solves your API Gateway needs, but provides a full-featured\ndeveloper and administrative experience. API Management is shown in Figure 4-6.\n\n63 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\n_Figure 4-6. Azure API Management_\n\nTo start, API Management exposes a gateway server that allows controlled access to back-end\nservices based upon configurable rules and policies. These services can be in the Azure cloud, your\non-prem data center, or other public clouds. API keys and JWT tokens determine who can do what. All\ntraffic is logged for analytical purposes.\n\nFor developers, API Management offers a developer portal that provides access to services,\ndocumentation, and sample code for invoking them. Developers can use Swagger/Open API to\ninspect service endpoints and analyze their usage. The service works across the major development\nplatforms: .NET, Java, Golang, and more.\n\nThe publisher portal exposes a management dashboard where administrators expose APIs and\nmanage their behavior. Service access can be granted, service health monitored, and service telemetry\ngathered. Administrators apply _policies_ [to each endpoint to affect behavior. Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-policies) are pre-built\nstatements that execute sequentially for each service call. Policies are configured for an inbound call,\noutbound call, or invoked upon an error. Policies can be applied at different service scopes as to\nenable deterministic ordering when combining policies. The product ships with a large number of\n[prebuilt policies.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-policies)\n\nHere are examples of how policies can affect the behavior of your cloud-native services:\n\n['Restrict service access.', 'Enforce authentication.']\n\n['Throttle calls from a single source, if necessary.', 'Enable caching.', 'Block calls from specific IP addresses.']\n\n64 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\n['Control the flow of the service.', 'Convert requests from SOAP to REST or between different data formats, such as from XML to\\nJSON.']\n\nAzure API Management can expose back-end services that are hosted anywhere \u2013 in the cloud or your\ndata center. For legacy services that you may expose in your cloud-native systems, it supports both\nREST and SOAP APIs. Even other Azure services can be exposed through API Management. You could\n[place a managed API on top of an Azure backing service like Azure Service Bus or Azure Logic Apps.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/)\nAzure API Management doesn\u2019t include built-in load-balancing support and should be used in\nconjunction with a load-balancing service.\n\n[Azure API Management is available across four different tiers:](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/api-management/)\n\n['Developer', 'Basic', 'Standard', 'Premium']\n\nThe Developer tier is meant for non-production workloads and evaluation. The other tiers offer\nprogressively more power, features, and higher service level agreements (SLAs). The Premium tier\n[provides Azure Virtual Network and multi-region support. All tiers have a fixed price per hour.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview)\n\n[The Azure cloud also offers a serverless tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-azure-api-management-for-serverless-architectures/) for Azure API Management. Referred to as the\n_consumption pricing tier_, the service is a variant of API Management designed around the serverless\ncomputing model. Unlike the \u201cpre-allocated\u201d pricing tiers previously shown, the consumption tier\nprovides instant provisioning and pay-per-action pricing.\n\nIt enables API Gateway features for the following use cases:\n\n['[Microservices implemented using serverless technologies such as Azure Functions and Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview)\\n[Logic Apps.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/)', 'Azure backing service resources such as Service Bus queues and topics, Azure storage, and\\nothers.', 'Microservices where traffic has occasional large spikes but remains low most the time.']\n\nThe consumption tier uses the same underlying service API Management components, but employs\nan entirely different architecture based on dynamically allocated resources. It aligns perfectly with the\nserverless computing model:\n\n['No infrastructure to manage.', 'No idle capacity.', 'High-availability.', 'Automatic scaling.', 'Cost is based on actual usage.']\n\nThe new consumption tier is a great choice for cloud-native systems that expose serverless resources\nas APIs.\n\n65 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns", "**Real-time communication**": "Real-time, or push, communication is another option for front-end applications that communicate\nwith back-end cloud-native systems over HTTP. Applications, such as financial-tickers, online\neducation, gaming, and job-progress updates, require instantaneous, real-time responses from the\nback-end. With normal HTTP communication, there\u2019s no way for the client to know when new data is\navailable. The client must continually _poll_ or send requests to the server. With _real-time_\ncommunication, the server can push new data to the client at any time.\n\nReal-time systems are often characterized by high-frequency data flows and large numbers of\nconcurrent client connections. Manually implementing real-time connectivity can quickly become\ncomplex, requiring non-trivial infrastructure to ensure scalability and reliable messaging to connected\nclients. You could find yourself managing an instance of Azure Redis Cache and a set of load\nbalancers configured with sticky sessions for client affinity.\n\n[Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/signalr-service/) is a fully managed Azure service that simplifies real-time communication for\nyour cloud-native applications. Technical implementation details like capacity provisioning, scaling,\nand persistent connections are abstracted away. They\u2019re handled for you with a 99.9% service-level\nagreement. You focus on application features, not infrastructure plumbing.\n\nOnce enabled, a cloud-based HTTP service can push content updates directly to connected clients,\nincluding browser, mobile and desktop applications. Clients are updated without the need to poll the\nserver. Azure SignalR abstracts the transport technologies that create real-time connectivity, including\nWebSockets, Server-Side Events, and Long Polling. Developers focus on sending messages to all or\nspecific subsets of connected clients.\n\nFigure 4-7 shows a set of HTTP Clients connecting to a Cloud-native application with Azure SignalR\nenabled.\n\n66 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\n_Figure 4-7. Azure SignalR_\n\nAnother advantage of Azure SignalR Service comes with implementing Serverless cloud-native\nservices. Perhaps your code is executed on demand with Azure Functions triggers. This scenario can\nbe tricky because your code doesn\u2019t maintain long connections with clients. Azure SignalR Service can\nhandle this situation since the service already manages connections for you.\n\nAzure SignalR Service closely integrates with other Azure services, such as Azure SQL Database,\nService Bus, or Redis Cache, opening up many possibilities for your cloud-native applications."}, "Service-to-service communication": {"**Queries**": "Many times, one microservice might need to _query_ another, requiring an immediate response to\ncomplete an operation. A shopping basket microservice may need product information and a price to\nadd an item to its basket. There are many approaches for implementing query operations.\n\n**Request/Response Messaging**\n\nOne option for implementing this scenario is for the calling back-end microservice to make direct\nHTTP requests to the microservices it needs to query, shown in Figure 4-8.\n\n_Figure 4-8. Direct HTTP communication_\n\nWhile direct HTTP calls between microservices are relatively simple to implement, care should be\ntaken to minimize this practice. To start, these calls are always _synchronous_ and will block the\noperation until a result is returned or the request times outs. What were once self-contained,\nindependent services, able to evolve independently and deploy frequently, now become coupled to\neach other. As coupling among microservices increase, their architectural benefits diminish.\n\n68 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\nExecuting an infrequent request that makes a single direct HTTP call to another microservice might be\nacceptable for some systems. However, high-volume calls that invoke direct HTTP calls to multiple\nmicroservices aren\u2019t advisable. They can increase latency and negatively impact the performance,\nscalability, and availability of your system. Even worse, a long series of direct HTTP communication can\nlead to deep and complex chains of synchronous microservices calls, shown in Figure 4-9:\n\n_Figure 4-9. Chaining HTTP queries_\n\nYou can certainly imagine the risk in the design shown in the previous image. What happens if Step\n#3 fails? Or Step #8 fails? How do you recover? What if Step #6 is slow because the underlying service\nis busy? How do you continue? Even if all works correctly, think of the latency this call would incur,\nwhich is the sum of the latency of each step.\n\nThe large degree of coupling in the previous image suggests the services weren\u2019t optimally modeled.\nIt would behoove the team to revisit their design.\n\n**Materialized View pattern**\n\n[A popular option for removing microservice coupling is the Materialized View pattern. With this](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view)\npattern, a microservice stores its own local, denormalized copy of data that\u2019s owned by other services.\nInstead of the Shopping Basket microservice querying the Product Catalog and Pricing microservices,\nit maintains its own local copy of that data. This pattern eliminates unnecessary coupling and\nimproves reliability and response time. The entire operation executes inside a single process. We\nexplore this pattern and other data concerns in Chapter 5.\n\n**Service Aggregator Pattern**\n\n[Another option for eliminating microservice-to-microservice coupling is an Aggregator microservice,](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cesardelatorre/designing-and-implementing-api-gateways-with-ocelot-in-a-microservices-and-container-based-architecture/)\nshown in purple in Figure 4-10.\n\n69 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\n_Figure 4-10. Aggregator microservice_\n\nThe pattern isolates an operation that makes calls to multiple back-end microservices, centralizing its\nlogic into a specialized microservice. The purple checkout aggregator microservice in the previous\nfigure orchestrates the workflow for the Checkout operation. It includes calls to several back-end\nmicroservices in a sequenced order. Data from the workflow is aggregated and returned to the caller.\nWhile it still implements direct HTTP calls, the aggregator microservice reduces direct dependencies\namong back-end microservices.\n\n**Request/Reply Pattern**\n\n[Another approach for decoupling synchronous HTTP messages is a Request-Reply Pattern, which uses](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RequestReply.html)\nqueuing communication. Communication using a queue is always a one-way channel, with a producer\nsending the message and consumer receiving it. With this pattern, both a request queue and response\nqueue are implemented, shown in Figure 4-11.\n\n70 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\n_Figure 4-11. Request-reply pattern_\n\nHere, the message producer creates a query-based message that contains a unique correlation ID and\nplaces it into a request queue. The consuming service dequeues the messages, processes it and places\nthe response into the response queue with the same correlation ID. The producer service dequeues\nthe message, matches it with the correlation ID and continues processing. We cover queues in detail\nin the next section.", "**Commands**": "Another type of communication interaction is a _command_ . A microservice may need another\nmicroservice to perform an action. The Ordering microservice may need the Shipping microservice to\ncreate a shipment for an approved order. In Figure 4-12, one microservice, called a Producer, sends a\nmessage to another microservice, the Consumer, commanding it to do something.\n\n71 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\n_Figure 4-12. Command interaction with a queue_\n\nMost often, the Producer doesn\u2019t require a response and can _fire-and-forget_ the message. If a reply is\nneeded, the Consumer sends a separate message back to Producer on another channel. A command\nmessage is best sent asynchronously with a message queue. supported by a lightweight message\nbroker. In the previous diagram, note how a queue separates and decouples both services.\n\nA message queue is an intermediary construct through which a producer and consumer pass a\nmessage. Queues implement an asynchronous, point-to-point messaging pattern. The Producer\nknows where a command needs to be sent and routes appropriately. The queue guarantees that a\nmessage is processed by exactly one of the consumer instances that are reading from the channel. In\nthis scenario, either the producer or consumer service can scale out without affecting the other. As\nwell, technologies can be disparate on each side, meaning that we might have a Java microservice\n[calling a Golang](https://golang.org/) microservice.\n\nIn chapter 1, we talked about _backing services_ . Backing services are ancillary resources upon which\ncloud-native systems depend. Message queues are backing services. The Azure cloud supports two\ntypes of message queues that your cloud-native systems can consume to implement command\nmessaging: Azure Storage Queues and Azure Service Bus Queues.\n\n**Azure Storage Queues**\n\nAzure storage queues offer a simple queueing infrastructure that is fast, affordable, and backed by\nAzure storage accounts.\n\n[Azure Storage Queues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction) feature a REST-based queuing mechanism with reliable and persistent\nmessaging. They provide a minimal feature set, but are inexpensive and store millions of messages.\nTheir capacity ranges up to 500 TB. A single message can be up to 64 KB in size.\n\nYou can access messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS.\nStorage queues can scale out to large numbers of concurrent clients to handle traffic spikes.\n\n72 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\nThat said, there are limitations with the service:\n\n['Message order isn\u2019t guaranteed.']\n\n['A message can only persist for seven days before it\u2019s automatically removed.']\n\n['Support for state management, duplicate detection, or transactions isn\u2019t available.']\n\nFigure 4-13 shows the hierarchy of an Azure Storage Queue.\n\n_Figure 4-13. Storage queue hierarchy_\n\nIn the previous figure, note how storage queues store their messages in the underlying Azure Storage\naccount.\n\nFor developers, Microsoft provides several client and server-side libraries for Storage queue\nprocessing. Most major platforms are supported including .NET, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and\nGo. Developers should never communicate directly with these libraries. Doing so will tightly couple\nyour microservice code to the Azure Storage Queue service. It\u2019s a better practice to insulate the\nimplementation details of the API. Introduce an intermediation layer, or intermediate API, that exposes\ngeneric operations and encapsulates the concrete library. This loose coupling enables you to swap out\none queuing service for another without having to make changes to the mainline service code.\n\nAzure Storage queues are an economical option to implement command messaging in your cloudnative applications. Especially when a queue size will exceed 80 GB, or a simple feature set is\nacceptable. You only pay for the storage of the messages; there are no fixed hourly charges.\n\n**Azure Service Bus Queues**\n\nFor more complex messaging requirements, consider Azure Service Bus queues.\n\n[Sitting atop a robust message infrastructure, Azure Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview) supports a _brokered messaging model_ .\nMessages are reliably stored in a broker (the queue) until received by the consumer. The queue\nguarantees First-In/First-Out (FIFO) message delivery, respecting the order in which messages were\nadded to the queue.\n\nThe size of a message can be much larger, up to 256 KB. Messages are persisted in the queue for an\nunlimited period of time. Service Bus supports not only HTTP-based calls, but also provides full\n\n73 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\n[support for the AMQP protocol. AMQP is an open-standard across vendors that supports a binary](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-amqp-overview)\nprotocol and higher degrees of reliability.\n\n[Service Bus provides a rich set of features, including transaction support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-transactions) [and a duplicate detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/duplicate-detection)\n[feature. The queue guarantees \u201cat most once delivery\u201d per message. It automatically discards a](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/duplicate-detection)\nmessage that has already been sent. If a producer is in doubt, it can resend the same message, and\nService Bus guarantees that only one copy will be processed. Duplicate detection frees you from\nhaving to build additional infrastructure plumbing.\n\nTwo more enterprise features are partitioning and sessions. A conventional Service Bus queue is\n[handled by a single message broker and stored in a single message store. But, Service Bus Partitioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-partitioning)\nspreads the queue across multiple message brokers and message stores. The overall throughput is no\nlonger limited by the performance of a single message broker or messaging store. A temporary\noutage of a messaging store doesn\u2019t render a partitioned queue unavailable.\n\n[Service Bus Sessions](https://codingcanvas.com/azure-service-bus-sessions/) provide a way to group-related messages. Imagine a workflow scenario where\nmessages must be processed together and the operation completed at the end. To take advantage,\nsessions must be explicitly enabled for the queue and each related messaged must contain the same\nsession ID.\n\nHowever, there are some important caveats: Service Bus queues size is limited to 80 GB, which is much\nsmaller than what\u2019s available from store queues. Additionally, Service Bus queues incur a base cost\nand charge per operation.\n\nFigure 4-14 outlines the high-level architecture of a Service Bus queue.\n\n_Figure 4-14. Service Bus queue_\n\nIn the previous figure, note the point-to-point relationship. Two instances of the same provider are\nenqueuing messages into a single Service Bus queue. Each message is consumed by only one of three\nconsumer instances on the right. Next, we discuss how to implement messaging where different\nconsumers may all be interested the same message.", "**Events**": "Message queuing is an effective way to implement communication where a producer can\nasynchronously send a consumer a message. However, what happens when _many different consumers_\n\n74 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\nare interested in the same message? A dedicated message queue for each consumer wouldn\u2019t scale\nwell and would become difficult to manage.\n\nTo address this scenario, we move to the third type of message interaction, the _event_ . One\nmicroservice announces that an action had occurred. Other microservices, if interested, react to the\n[action, or event. This is also known as the event-driven architectural style.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven)\n\nEventing is a two-step process. For a given state change, a microservice publishes an event to a\nmessage broker, making it available to any other interested microservice. The interested microservice\n[is notified by subscribing to the event in the message broker. You use the Publish/Subscribe pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/publisher-subscriber)\n[to implement event-based communication.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/multi-container-microservice-net-applications/integration-event-based-microservice-communications)\n\nFigure 4-15 shows a shopping basket microservice publishing an event with two other microservices\nsubscribing to it.\n\n_Figure 4-15. Event-Driven messaging_\n\nNote the _event bus_ component that sits in the middle of the communication channel. It\u2019s a custom\nclass that encapsulates the message broker and decouples it from the underlying application. The\nordering and inventory microservices independently operate the event with no knowledge of each\nother, nor the shopping basket microservice. When the registered event is published to the event bus,\nthey act upon it.\n\nWith eventing, we move from queuing technology to _topics_ [. A topic is similar to a queue, but supports](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-how-to-use-topics-subscriptions)\na one-to-many messaging pattern. One microservice publishes a message. Multiple subscribing\nmicroservices can choose to receive and act upon that message. Figure 4-16 shows a topic\narchitecture.\n\n75 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\n_Figure 4-16. Topic architecture_\n\nIn the previous figure, publishers send messages to the topic. At the end, subscribers receive\nmessages from subscriptions. In the middle, the topic forwards messages to subscriptions based on a\nset of rules, shown in dark blue boxes. Rules act as a filter that forward specific messages to a\nsubscription. Here, a \u201cGetPrice\u201d event would be sent to the price and logging subscriptions as the\nlogging subscription has chosen to receive all messages. A \u201cGetInformation\u201d event would be sent to\nthe information and logging subscriptions.\n\nThe Azure cloud supports two different topic services: Azure Service Bus Topics and Azure EventGrid.\n\n**Azure Service Bus Topics**\n\n[Sitting on top of the same robust brokered message model of Azure Service Bus queues are Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-how-to-use-topics-subscriptions)\n[Service Bus Topics. A topic can receive messages from multiple independent publishers and send](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-how-to-use-topics-subscriptions)\nmessages to up to 2,000 subscribers. Subscriptions can be dynamically added or removed at run time\nwithout stopping the system or recreating the topic.\n\nMany advanced features from Azure Service Bus queues are also available for topics, including\n[Duplicate Detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/duplicate-detection) [and Transaction support. By default, Service Bus topics are handled by a single](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-transactions)\n[message broker and stored in a single message store. But, Service Bus Partitioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-partitioning) scales a topic by\nspreading it across many message brokers and message stores.\n\n[Scheduled Message Delivery tags a message with a specific time for processing. The message won\u2019t](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-sequencing)\n[appear in the topic before that time. Message Deferral](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-deferral) enables you to defer a retrieval of a message\nto a later time. Both are commonly used in workflow processing scenarios where operations are\nprocessed in a particular order. You can postpone processing of received messages until prior work\nhas been completed.\n\nService Bus topics are a robust and proven technology for enabling publish/subscribe communication\nin your cloud-native systems.\n\n**Azure Event Grid**\n\nWhile Azure Service Bus is a battle-tested messaging broker with a full set of enterprise features,\n[Azure Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview) is the new kid on the block.\n\n76 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\nAt first glance, Event Grid may look like just another topic-based messaging system. However, it\u2019s\ndifferent in many ways. Focused on event-driven workloads, it enables real-time event processing,\ndeep Azure integration, and an open-platform - all on serverless infrastructure. It\u2019s designed for\ncontemporary cloud-native and serverless applications\n\nAs a centralized _eventing backplane_, or pipe, Event Grid reacts to events inside Azure resources and\nfrom your own services.\n\nEvent notifications are published to an Event Grid Topic, which, in turn, routes each event to a\nsubscription. Subscribers map to subscriptions and consume the events. Like Service Bus, Event Grid\nsupports a _filtered subscriber model_ where a subscription sets rule for the events it wishes to receive.\nEvent Grid provides fast throughput with a guarantee of 10 million events per second enabling near\nreal-time delivery - far more than what Azure Service Bus can generate.\n\nA sweet spot for Event Grid is its deep integration into the fabric of Azure infrastructure. An Azure\nresource, such as Cosmos DB, can publish built-in events directly to other interested Azure resources without the need for custom code. Event Grid can publish events from an Azure Subscription,\nResource Group, or Service, giving developers fine-grained control over the lifecycle of cloud\nresources. However, Event Grid isn\u2019t limited to Azure. It\u2019s an open platform that can consume custom\nHTTP events published from applications or third-party services and route events to external\nsubscribers.\n\nWhen publishing and subscribing to native events from Azure resources, no coding is required. With\nsimple configuration, you can integrate events from one Azure resource to another leveraging built-in\nplumbing for Topics and Subscriptions. Figure 4-17 shows the anatomy of Event Grid.\n\n_Figure 4-17. Event Grid anatomy_\n\n77 CHAPTER 4 | Cloud-native communication patterns\n\nA major difference between EventGrid and Service Bus is the underlying _message exchange pattern_ .\n\nService Bus implements an older style _pull model_ in which the downstream subscriber actively polls\nthe topic subscription for new messages. On the upside, this approach gives the subscriber full control\nof the pace at which it processes messages. It controls when and how many messages to process at\nany given time. Unread messages remain in the subscription until processed. A significant\nshortcoming is the latency between the time the event is generated and the polling operation that\npulls that message to the subscriber for processing. Also, the overhead of constant polling for the\nnext event consumes resources and money.\n\nEventGrid, however, is different. It implements a _push model_ in which events are sent to the\nEventHandlers as received, giving near real-time event delivery. It also reduces cost as the service is\ntriggered only when it\u2019s needed to consume an event \u2013 not continually as with polling. That said, an\nevent handler must handle the incoming load and provide throttling mechanisms to protect itself\nfrom becoming overwhelmed. Many Azure services that consume these events, such as Azure\nFunctions and Logic Apps provide automatic autoscaling capabilities to handle increased loads.\n\nEvent Grid is a fully managed serverless cloud service.

Under the covers, that local function invokes another function on a remote machine. What\nappears to be a local call essentially becomes a transparent out-of-process call to a remote service.\nThe RPC plumbing abstracts the point-to-point networking communication, serialization, and\nexecution between computers.\n\nIn cloud-native applications, developers often work across programming languages, frameworks, and\ntechnologies. This _interoperability_ complicates message contracts and the plumbing required for\ncross-platform communication. gRPC provides a \u201cuniform horizontal layer\u201d that abstracts these\nconcerns.

Server-side components provide gRPC plumbing that custom service\nclasses can inherit and consume.\n\nMicroservices that expose both a RESTful API and gRPC communication require multiple endpoints to\nmanage traffic. You would open an endpoint that listens for HTTP traffic for the RESTful calls and\nanother for gRPC calls. The gRPC endpoint must be configured for the HTTP/2 protocol that is\nrequired for gRPC communication.\n\nWhile we strive to decouple microservices with asynchronous communication patterns, some\noperations require direct calls. gRPC should be the primary choice for direct synchronous\ncommunication between microservices.

Their\nschemaless nature allows developers to move away from an architecture of typed data classes and\nORMs that make change expensive and time-consuming. We cover NoSQL databases later in this\nchapter.\n\nWhile encapsulating data into separate microservices can increase agility, performance, and scalability,\nit also presents many challenges. In the next section, we discuss these challenges along with patterns\nand practices to help overcome them.", "Cross-service queries": "While microservices are independent and focus on specific functional capabilities, like inventory,\nshipping, or ordering, they frequently require integration with other microservices. Often the\nintegration involves one microservice _querying_ another for data. Figure 5-3 shows the scenario.\n\n_Figure 5-3. Querying across microservices_\n\nIn the preceding figure, we see a shopping basket microservice that adds an item to a user\u2019s shopping\nbasket. While the data store for this microservice contains basket and line item data, it doesn\u2019t\nmaintain product or pricing data. Instead, those data items are owned by the catalog and pricing\nmicroservices. This aspect presents a problem. How can the shopping basket microservice add a\nproduct to the user\u2019s shopping basket when it doesn\u2019t have product nor pricing data in its database?\n\nOne option discussed in Chapter 4 is a direct HTTP call from the shopping basket to the catalog and\npricing microservices. However, in chapter 4, we said synchronous HTTP calls _couple_ microservices\ntogether, reducing their autonomy and diminishing their architectural benefits.\n\nWe could also implement a request-reply pattern with separate inbound and outbound queues for\neach service. However, this pattern is complicated and requires plumbing to correlate request and\nresponse messages. While it does decouple the backend microservice calls, the calling service must\nstill synchronously wait for the call to complete. Network congestion, transient faults, or an\noverloaded microservice and can result in long-running and even failed operations.\n\n90 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\n[Instead, a widely accepted pattern for removing cross-service dependencies is the Materialized View](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view)\n[Pattern, shown in Figure 5-4.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view)\n\n_Figure 5-4. Materialized View Pattern_\n\nWith this pattern, you place a local data table (known as a _read model_ ) in the shopping basket service.\nThis table contains a denormalized copy of the data needed from the product and pricing\nmicroservices. Copying the data directly into the shopping basket microservice eliminates the need for\nexpensive cross-service calls. With the data local to the service, you improve the service\u2019s response\ntime and reliability. Additionally, having its own copy of the data makes the shopping basket service\nmore resilient. If the catalog service should become unavailable, it wouldn\u2019t directly impact the\nshopping basket service. The shopping basket can continue operating with the data from its own\nstore.\n\nThe catch with this approach is that you now have duplicate data in your system. However,\n_strategically_ duplicating data in cloud-native systems is an established practice and not considered an\nanti-pattern, or bad practice. Keep in mind that _one and only one service_ can own a data set and have\nauthority over it. You\u2019ll need to synchronize the read models when the system of record is updated.\nSynchronization is typically implemented via asynchronous messaging with a publish/subscribe\npattern, as shown in Figure 5.4.", "Distributed transactions": "While querying data across microservices is difficult, implementing a transaction across several\nmicroservices is even more complex. The inherent challenge of maintaining data consistency across\nindependent data sources in different microservices can\u2019t be understated. The lack of distributed\ntransactions in cloud-native applications means that you must manage distributed transactions\nprogrammatically. You move from a world of _immediate consistency_ to that of _eventual consistency_ .\n\nFigure 5-5 shows the problem.\n\n91 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\n_Figure 5-5. Implementing a transaction across microservices_\n\nIn the preceding figure, five independent microservices participate in a distributed transaction that\ncreates an order. Each microservice maintains its own data store and implements a local transaction\nfor its store. To create the order, the local transaction for _each_ individual microservice must succeed,\nor _all_ must abort and roll back the operation. While built-in transactional support is available inside\neach of the microservices, there\u2019s no support for a distributed transaction that would span across all\nfive services to keep data consistent.\n\nInstead, you must construct this distributed transaction _programmatically_ .\n\nA popular pattern for adding distributed transactional support is the Saga pattern. It\u2019s implemented\nby grouping local transactions together programmatically and sequentially invoking each one. If any\n[of the local transactions fail, the Saga aborts the operation and invokes a set of compensating](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction)\n[transactions. The compensating transactions undo the changes made by the preceding local](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction)\ntransactions and restore data consistency. Figure 5-6 shows a failed transaction with the Saga pattern.\n\n_Figure 5-6. Rolling back a transaction_\n\n92 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\nIn the previous figure, the _Update Inventory_ operation has failed in the Inventory microservice. The\nSaga invokes a set of compensating transactions (in red) to adjust the inventory counts, cancel the\npayment and the order, and return the data for each microservice back to a consistent state.\n\nSaga patterns are typically choreographed as a series of related events, or orchestrated as a set of\nrelated commands. In Chapter 4, we discussed the service aggregator pattern that would be the\nfoundation for an orchestrated saga implementation. We also discussed eventing along with Azure\nService Bus and Azure Event Grid topics that would be a foundation for a choreographed saga\nimplementation.", "High volume data": {"**CQRS**": "[CQRS, is an architectural pattern that can help maximize performance, scalability, and security. The](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)\npattern separates operations that read data from those operations that write data.\n\nFor normal scenarios, the same entity model and data repository object are used for _both_ read and\nwrite operations.\n\nHowever, a high volume data scenario can benefit from separate models and data tables for reads\nand writes. To improve performance, the read operation could query against a highly denormalized\nrepresentation of the data to avoid expensive repetitive table joins and table locks. The _write_\noperation, known as a _command_, would update against a fully normalized representation of the data\nthat would guarantee consistency. You then need to implement a mechanism to keep both\nrepresentations in sync. Typically, whenever the write table is modified, it publishes an event that\nreplicates the modification to the read table.\n\nFigure 5-7 shows an implementation of the CQRS pattern.\n\n_Figure 5-7. CQRS implementation_\n\n93 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\nIn the previous figure, separate command and query models are implemented. Each data write\noperation is saved to the write store and then propagated to the read store. Pay close attention to\n[how the data propagation process operates on the principle of eventual consistency. The read model](https://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/eventual_consistency/)\neventually synchronizes with the write model, but there may be some lag in the process. We discuss\neventual consistency in the next section.\n\nThis separation enables reads and writes to scale independently. Read operations use a schema\noptimized for queries, while the writes use a schema optimized for updates. Read queries go against\ndenormalized data, while complex business logic can be applied to the write model. As well, you\nmight impose tighter security on write operations than those exposing reads.\n\nImplementing CQRS can improve application performance for cloud-native services. However, it does\nresult in a more complex design. Apply this principle carefully and strategically to those sections of\n[your cloud-native application that will benefit from it. For more on CQRS, see the Microsoft book .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/apply-simplified-microservice-cqrs-ddd-patterns)\n[Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/apply-simplified-microservice-cqrs-ddd-patterns)", "**Event sourcing**": "[Another approach to optimizing high volume data scenarios involves Event Sourcing.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing)\n\nA system typically stores the current state of a data entity. If a user changes their phone number, for\nexample, the customer record is updated with the new number. We always know the current state of a\ndata entity, but each update overwrites the previous state.\n\nIn most cases, this model works fine. In high volume systems, however, overhead from transactional\nlocking and frequent update operations can impact database performance, responsiveness, and limit\nscalability.\n\nEvent Sourcing takes a different approach to capturing data. Each operation that affects data is\npersisted to an event store. Instead of updating the state of a data record, we append each change to\na sequential list of past events - similar to an accountant\u2019s ledger. The Event Store becomes the\nsystem of record for the data. It\u2019s used to propagate various materialized views within the bounded\ncontext of a microservice. Figure 5.8 shows the pattern.\n\n94 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\n_Figure 5-8. Event Sourcing_\n\nIn the previous figure, note how each entry (in blue) for a user\u2019s shopping cart is appended to an\nunderlying event store. In the adjoining materialized view, the system projects the current state by\nreplaying all the events associated with each shopping cart. This view, or read model, is then exposed\nback to the UI. Events can also be integrated with external systems and applications or queried to\ndetermine the current state of an entity. With this approach, you maintain history. You know not only\nthe current state of an entity, but also how you reached this state.\n\nMechanically speaking, event sourcing simplifies the write model. There are no updates or deletes.\nAppending each data entry as an immutable event minimizes contention, locking, and concurrency\nconflicts associated with relational databases. Building read models with the materialized view pattern\nenables you to decouple the view from the write model and choose the best data store to optimize\nthe needs of your application UI.\n\nFor this pattern, consider a data store that directly supports event sourcing. Azure Cosmos DB,\nMongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, and RavenDB are good candidates.\n\nAs with all patterns and technologies, implement strategically and when needed. While event sourcing\ncan provide increased performance and scalability, it comes at the expense of complexity and a\nlearning curve.\n\n95 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns"}, "Relational vs. NoSQL data": {"**The CAP theorem**": "As a way to understand the differences between these types of databases, consider the CAP theorem,\na set of principles applied to distributed systems that store state. Figure 5-10 shows the three\nproperties of the CAP theorem.\n\n_Figure 5-10. The CAP theorem_\n\nThe theorem states that distributed data systems will offer a trade-off between consistency,\navailability, and partition tolerance. And, that any database can only guarantee _two_ of the three\nproperties:\n\n['_Consistency._ Every node in the cluster responds with the most recent data, even if the system\\nmust block the request until all replicas update. If you query a \u201cconsistent system\u201d for an item\\nthat is currently updating, you\u2019ll wait for that response until all replicas successfully update.\\nHowever, you\u2019ll receive the most current data.']\n\n['_Availability._ Every node returns an immediate response, even if that response isn\u2019t the most\\nrecent data. If you query an \u201cavailable system\u201d for an item that is updating, you\u2019ll get the best\\npossible answer the service can provide at that moment.']\n\n['_Partition Tolerance._ Guarantees the system continues to operate even if a replicated data\\nnode fails or loses connectivity with other replicated data nodes.']\n\nCAP theorem explains the tradeoffs associated with managing consistency and availability during a\nnetwork partition; however tradeoffs with respect to consistency and performance also exist with the\n[absence of a network partition. CAP theorem is often further extended to PACELC](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~abadi/papers/abadi-pacelc.pdf) to explain the\ntradeoffs more comprehensively.\n\nRelational databases typically provide consistency and availability, but not partition tolerance. They\u2019re\ntypically provisioned to a single server and scale vertically by adding more resources to the machine.\n\n97 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\nMany relational database systems support built-in replication features where copies of the primary\ndatabase can be made to other secondary server instances. Write operations are made to the primary\ninstance and replicated to each of the secondaries. Upon a failure, the primary instance can fail over\nto a secondary to provide high availability. Secondaries can also be used to distribute read operations.\nWhile writes operations always go against the primary replica, read operations can be routed to any of\nthe secondaries to reduce system load.\n\n[Data can also be horizontally partitioned across multiple nodes, such as with sharding. But, sharding](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-elastic-scale-introduction)\ndramatically increases operational overhead by spitting data across many pieces that cannot easily\ncommunicate. It can be costly and time consuming to manage. Relational features that include table\njoins, transactions, and referential integrity require steep performance penalties in sharded\ndeployments.\n\nReplication consistency and recovery point objectives can be tuned by configuring whether replication\noccurs synchronously or asynchronously. If data replicas were to lose network connectivity in a \u201chighly\nconsistent\u201d or synchronous relational database cluster, you wouldn\u2019t be able to write to the database.\nThe system would reject the write operation as it can\u2019t replicate that change to the other data replica.\nEvery data replica has to update before the transaction can complete.\n\nNoSQL databases typically support high availability and partition tolerance. They scale out\nhorizontally, often across commodity servers. This approach provides tremendous availability, both\nwithin and across geographical regions at a reduced cost. You partition and replicate data across\nthese machines, or nodes, providing redundancy and fault tolerance. Consistency is typically tuned\nthrough consensus protocols or quorum mechanisms. They provide more control when navigating\ntradeoffs between tuning synchronous versus asynchronous replication in relational systems.\n\nIf data replicas were to lose connectivity in a \u201chighly available\u201d NoSQL database cluster, you could still\ncomplete a write operation to the database. The database cluster would allow the write operation and\nupdate each data replica as it becomes available. NoSQL databases that support multiple writable\nreplicas can further strengthen high availability by avoiding the need for failover when optimizing\nrecovery time objective.\n\nModern NoSQL databases typically implement partitioning capabilities as a feature of their system\ndesign. Partition management is often built-in to the database, and routing is achieved through\nplacement hints - often called partition keys. A flexible data models enables the NoSQL databases to\nlower the burden of schema management and improve availability when deploying application\nupdates that require data model changes.\n\nHigh availability and massive scalability are often more critical to the business than relational table\njoins and referential integrity. Developers can implement techniques and patterns such as Sagas,\nCQRS, and asynchronous messaging to embrace eventual consistency.\n\nNowadays, care must be taken when considering the CAP theorem constraints. A new type of\ndatabase, called NewSQL, has emerged which extends the relational database engine to support both\nhorizontal scalability and the scalable performance of NoSQL systems.\n\n98 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns", "**Considerations for relational vs. NoSQL systems**": "Based upon specific data requirements, a cloud-native-based microservice can implement a relational,\n\n|NoSQL datastore or both.|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|**Consider a NoSQL datastore when:**|**Consider a relational database when:**|\n|You have high volume workloads that require<br>predictable latency at large scale (for example,<br>latency measured in milliseconds while<br>performing millions of transactions per second)|Your workload volume generally fits within<br>thousands of transactions per second|\n|Your data is dynamic and frequently changes|Your data is highly structured and requires<br>referential integrity|\n|Relationships can be de-normalized data<br>models|Relationships are expressed through table joins<br>on normalized data models|\n|Data retrieval is simple and expressed without<br>table joins|You work with complex queries and reports|\n|Data is typically replicated across geographies<br>and requires finer control over consistency,<br>availability, and performance|Data is typically centralized, or can be replicated<br>regions asynchronously|\n|Your application will be deployed to commodity<br>hardware, such as with public clouds|Your application will be deployed to large, high-<br>end hardware|\n\nIn the next sections, we\u2019ll explore the options available in the Azure cloud for storing and managing\nyour cloud-native data.", "**Database as a Service**": "To start, you could provision an Azure virtual machine and install your database of choice for each\nservice.

The engine can create a single database per server or multiple databases per server that\nshare resources. You can continue to manage data using the same open-source tools without having\nto learn new skills or manage virtual machines.\n\n**Azure Database for MariaDB**\n\n[MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) Server is another popular open-source database server. It was created as a _fork_ of MySQL\nwhen Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems, who owned MySQL. The intent was to ensure that MariaDB\nremained open-source. As MariaDB is a fork of MySQL, the data and table definitions are compatible,\nand the client protocols, structures, and APIs, are close-knit.\n\n101 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\nMariaDB has a strong community and is used by many large enterprises.

It has\nbeen adopted by many large companies across the world, including Coca-Cola, Skype, ExxonMobil,\nand Liberty Mutual.\n\nIf your services require fast response from anywhere in the world, high availability, or elastic\nscalability, Cosmos DB is a great choice. Figure 5-12 shows Cosmos DB.\n\n102 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\n_Figure 5-12: Overview of Azure Cosmos DB_\n\nThe previous figure presents many of the built-in cloud-native capabilities available in Cosmos DB. In\nthis section, we\u2019ll take a closer look at them.\n\n**Global support**\n\nCloud-native applications often have a global audience and require global scale.\n\nYou can distribute Cosmos databases across regions or around the world, placing data close to your\nusers, improving response time, and reducing latency. You can add or remove a database from a\nregion without pausing or redeploying your services. In the background, Cosmos DB transparently\nreplicates the data to each of the configured regions.\n\n[Cosmos DB supports active/active clustering at the global level, enabling you to configure any of your](https://kemptechnologies.com/white-papers/unfog-confusion-active-passive-activeactive-load-balancing/)\ndatabase regions to support _both writes and reads_ .\n\n[The Multi-region write](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/conflict-resolution-policies) protocol is an important feature in Cosmos DB that enables the following\nfunctionality:\n\n['Unlimited elastic write and read scalability.']\n\n['99.999% read and write availability all around the world.']\n\n['Guaranteed reads and writes served in less than 10 milliseconds at the 99th percentile.']\n\n[With the Cosmos DB Multi-Homing APIs, your microservice is automatically aware of the nearest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally)\nAzure region and sends requests to it.

Should a region become unavailable, the Multi-Homing feature will\nautomatically route requests to the next nearest available region.\n\n**Multi-model support**\n\nWhen replatforming monolithic applications to a cloud-native architecture, development teams\nsometimes have to migrate open-source, NoSQL data stores. Cosmos DB can help you preserve your\n\n103 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\ninvestment in these NoSQL datastores with its _multi-model_ data platform.

For new apps, development teams can choose among opensource options or the built-in SQL API model.\n\nInternally, Cosmos stores the data in a simple struct format made up of primitive data types. For each\nrequest, the database engine translates the primitive data into the model representation you\u2019ve\nselected.\n\n[In the previous table, note the Table API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/table-introduction) option. This API is an evolution of Azure Table Storage. Both\nshare the same underlying table model, but the Cosmos DB Table API adds premium enhancements\nnot available in the Azure Storage API.

No\ncode changes are required.\n\n104 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\n**Tunable consistency**\n\nEarlier in the _Relational vs. NoSQL_ section, we discussed the subject of _data consistency_ . Data\nconsistency refers to the _integrity_ of your data. Cloud-native services with distributed data rely on\nreplication and must make a fundamental tradeoff between read consistency, availability, and latency.\n\nMost distributed databases allow developers to choose between two consistency\nmodels: strong consistency and eventual consistency. _Strong consistency_ is the gold standard of data\nprogrammability. It guarantees that a query will always return the most current data - even if the\nsystem must incur latency waiting for an update to replicate across all database copies. While a\ndatabase configured for _eventual consistency_ will return data immediately, even if that data isn\u2019t the\nmost current copy. The latter option enables higher availability, greater scale, and increased\nperformance.\n\n[Azure Cosmos DB offers five well-defined consistency models](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels) shown in Figure 5-13.\n\n_Figure 5-13: Cosmos DB Consistency Levels_\n\nThese options enable you to make precise choices and granular tradeoffs for consistency, availability,\nand the performance for your data. The levels are presented in the following table.\n\n|Consistency Level|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Eventual|No ordering guarantee for reads. Replicas will<br>eventually converge.|\n|Constant Prefix|Reads are still eventual, but data is returned in<br>the ordering in which it is written.|\n|Session|Guarantees you can read any data written<br>during the current session. It is the default<br>consistency level.|\n|Bounded Staleness|Reads trail writes by interval that you specify.|\n|Strong|Reads are guaranteed to return most recent<br>committed version of an item. A client never<br>sees an uncommitted or partial read.|\n\n[In the article Getting Behind the 9-Ball: Cosmos DB Consistency Levels Explained, Microsoft Program](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/2018-03-23_getting-behind-the-9ball-cosmosdb-consistency-levels/)\nManager Jeremy Likness provides an excellent explanation of the five models.\n\n**Partitioning**\n\n[Azure Cosmos DB embraces automatic partitioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview) to scale a database to meet the performance\nneeds of your cloud-native services.\n\nYou manage data in Cosmos DB data by creating databases, containers, and items.\n\n105 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\nContainers live in a Cosmos DB database and represent a schema-agnostic grouping of items. Items\nare the data that you add to the container. They\u2019re represented as documents, rows, nodes, or edges.\nAll items added to a container are automatically indexed.\n\nTo partition the container, items are divided into distinct subsets called logical partitions. Logical\npartitions are populated based on the value of a partition key that is associated with each item in a\ncontainer. Figure 5-14 shows two containers each with a logical partition based on a partition key\nvalue.\n\n_Figure 5-14: Cosmos DB partitioning mechanics_\n\nNote in the previous figure how each item includes a partition key of either \u2018city\u2019 or \u2018airport\u2019. The key\ndetermines the item\u2019s logical partition. Items with a city code are assigned to the container on the left,\nand items with an airport code, to the container on the right. Combining the partition key value with\nthe ID value creates an item\u2019s index, which uniquely identifies the item.\n\n[Internally, Cosmos DB automatically manages the placement of logical partitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data) on physical\npartitions to satisfy the scalability and performance needs of the container. As application throughput\nand storage requirements increase, Azure Cosmos DB redistributes logical partitions across a greater\nnumber of servers. Redistribution operations are managed by Cosmos DB and invoked without\ninterruption or downtime.", "**NewSQL databases**": "_NewSQL_ is an emerging database technology that combines the distributed scalability of NoSQL with\nthe ACID guarantees of a relational database. NewSQL databases are important for business systems\nthat must process high-volumes of data, across distributed environments, with full transactional\nsupport and ACID compliance. While a NoSQL database can provide massive scalability, it does not\nguarantee data consistency. Intermittent problems from inconsistent data can place a burden on the\ndevelopment team. Developers must construct safeguards into their microservice code to manage\nproblems caused by inconsistent data.\n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) features several NewSQL database projects.\n\n106 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\n|Project|Characteristics|\n|---|---|\n|Cockroach DB|An ACID-compliant, relational database that<br>scales globally.

Three of the offerings are full database products, which include .NET support. The other,\nVitess, is a database clustering system that horizontally scales large clusters of MySQL instances.\n\nA key design goal for NewSQL databases is to work natively in Kubernetes, taking advantage of the\nplatform\u2019s resiliency and scalability.\n\nNewSQL databases are designed to thrive in ephemeral cloud environments where underlying virtual\nmachines can be restarted or rescheduled at a moment\u2019s notice. The databases are designed to\nsurvive node failures without data loss nor downtime. CockroachDB, for example, is able to survive a\nmachine loss by maintaining three consistent replicas of any data across the nodes in a cluster.\n\nKubernetes uses a _Services construct_ to allow a client to address a group of identical NewSQL\ndatabases processes from a single DNS entry. By decoupling the database instances from the address\n\n107 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\nof the service with which it\u2019s associated, we can scale without disrupting existing application instances.\nSending a request to any service at a given time will always yield the same result.\n\nIn this scenario, all database instances are equal. There are no primary or secondary relationships.\nTechniques like _consensus replication_ found in CockroachDB allow any database node to handle any\nrequest. If the node that receives a load-balanced request has the data it needs locally, it responds\nimmediately. If not, the node becomes a gateway and forwards the request to the appropriate nodes\nto get the correct answer. From the client\u2019s perspective, every database node is the same: They appear\nas a single _logical_ database with the consistency guarantees of a single-machine system, despite\nhaving dozens or even hundreds of nodes that are working behind the scenes.\n\n[For a detailed look at the mechanics behind NewSQL databases, see the DASH: Four Properties of](https://thenewstack.io/dash-four-properties-of-kubernetes-native-databases/)\n[Kubernetes-Native Databases article.](https://thenewstack.io/dash-four-properties-of-kubernetes-native-databases/)", "**Data migration to the cloud**": "One of the more time-consuming tasks is migrating data from one data platform to another.

The cache is hosted\nas a cloud-based backing service, separate from the microservices. Figure 5-15 shows the architecture.\n\n_Figure 5-15: Caching in a cloud native app_\n\nIn the previous figure, note how the cache is independent of and shared by the microservices. In this\nscenario, the cache is invoked by the API Gateway. As discussed in chapter 4, the gateway serves as a\nfront end for all incoming requests. The distributed cache increases system responsiveness by\nreturning cached data whenever possible. Additionally, separating the cache from the services allows\nthe cache to scale up or out independently to meet increased traffic demands.\n\n[The previous figure presents a common caching pattern known as the cache-aside pattern. For an](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/cache-aside)\nincoming request, you first query the cache (step #1) for a response. If found, the data is returned\n[immediately.

It\u2019s then written to the cache for future requests (step #3),\nand returned to the caller. Care must be taken to periodically evict cached data so that the system\nremains timely and consistent.\n\nAs a shared cache grows, it might prove beneficial to partition its data across multiple nodes. Doing\nso can help minimize contention and improve scalability. Many Caching services support the ability to\n\n109 CHAPTER 5 | Cloud-native data patterns\n\ndynamically add and remove nodes and rebalance data across partitions.

These faults can range in severity from a partial loss of connectivity to the complete failure of\na service. In these situations, it\u2019s pointless for an application to continually retry an operation that is\nunlikely to succeed.\n\nTo make things worse, executing continual retry operations on a non-responsive service can move\nyou into a self-imposed denial of service scenario where you flood your service with continual calls\nexhausting resources such as memory, threads and database connections, causing failure in unrelated\nparts of the system that use the same resources.\n\nIn these situations, it would be preferable for the operation to fail immediately and only attempt to\ninvoke the service if it\u2019s likely to succeed.\n\n[The Circuit Breaker pattern can prevent an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker)\nthat\u2019s likely to fail.

A hardware failure, such as a failed disk, can affect a single node in a\ncluster. A failed network switch could affect an entire server rack. Less common failures, such as loss of\npower, could disrupt a whole datacenter. Rarely, an entire region becomes unavailable.\n\n[Redundancy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/redundancy) is one way to provide application resilience. The exact level of redundancy needed\ndepends upon your business requirements and will affect both the cost and complexity of your\nsystem. For example, a multi-region deployment is more expensive and more complex to manage\nthan a single-region deployment. You\u2019ll need operational procedures to manage failover and failback.\nThe additional cost and complexity might be justified for some business scenarios, but not others.\n\nTo architect redundancy, you need to identify the critical paths in your application, and then\ndetermine if there\u2019s redundancy at each point in the path? If a subsystem should fail, will the\napplication fail over to something else? Finally, you need a clear understanding of those features built\n\n118 CHAPTER 6 | Cloud-native resiliency\n\ninto the Azure cloud platform that you can leverage to meet your redundancy requirements. Here are\nrecommendations for architecting redundancy:\n\n['_Deploy multiple instances of services._ If your application depends on a single instance of a\\nservice, it creates a single point of failure. Provisioning multiple instances improves both\\nresiliency and scalability. When hosting in Azure Kubernetes Service, you can declaratively\\nconfigure redundant instances (replica sets) in the Kubernetes manifest file. The replica count\\nvalue can be managed programmatically, in the portal, or through autoscaling features.']\n\n['_Leveraging a load balancer._ Load-balancing distributes your application\u2019s requests to healthy\\nservice instances and automatically removes unhealthy instances from rotation. When\\ndeploying to Kubernetes, load balancing can be specified in the Kubernetes manifest file in\\nthe Services section.']\n\n['_Plan for multiregion deployment._ If you deploy your application to a single region, and that\\nregion becomes unavailable, your application will also become unavailable. This may be\\nunacceptable under the terms of your application\u2019s service level agreements. Instead, consider\\ndeploying your application and its services across multiple regions. For example, an Azure\\nKubernetes Service (AKS) cluster is deployed to a single region. To protect your system from a\\nregional failure, you might deploy your application to multiple AKS clusters across different\\n[regions and use the Paired Regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/regions#region-pairs) feature to coordinate platform updates and prioritize\\nrecovery efforts.']\n\n['_[Enable geo-replication.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-active-geo-replication)_ Geo-replication for services such as Azure SQL Database and Cosmos\\nDB will create secondary replicas of your data across multiple regions. While both services will\\nautomatically replicate data within the same region, geo-replication protects you against a\\nregional outage by enabling you to fail over to a secondary region. Another best practice for\\ngeo-replication centers around storing container images. To deploy a service in AKS, you\\nneed to store and pull the image from a repository. Azure Container Registry integrates with\\nAKS and can securely store container images. To improve performance and availability,\\nconsider geo-replicating your images to a registry in each region where you have an AKS\\ncluster.

Here are recommendations for effectively implementing scaling in your system.\n\n['_Design for scaling._ An application must be designed for scaling. To start, services should be\\nstateless so that requests can be routed to any instance. Having stateless services also means\\nthat adding or removing an instance doesn\u2019t adversely impact current users.']\n\n['_Partition workloads_ . Decomposing domains into independent, self-contained microservices\\nenable each service to scale independently of others. Typically, services will have different\\nscalability needs and requirements. Partitioning enables you to scale only what needs to be\\nscaled without the unnecessary cost of scaling an entire application.']\n\n['_Favor scale-out._ Cloud-based applications favor scaling out resources as opposed to scaling\\nup. Scaling out (also known as horizontal scaling) involves adding more service resources to\\nan existing system to meet and share a desired level of performance. Scaling up (also known']\n\n120 CHAPTER 6 | Cloud-native resiliency\n\nas vertical scaling) involves replacing existing resources with more powerful hardware (more\ndisk, memory, and processing cores). Scaling out can be invoked automatically with the\nautoscaling features available in some Azure cloud resources. Scaling out across multiple\nresources also adds redundancy to the overall system. Finally scaling up a single resource is\ntypically more expensive than scaling out across many smaller resources. Figure 6-6 shows the\ntwo approaches:\n\n_Figure 6-6. Scale up versus scale out_\n\n['_Scale proportionally._ When scaling a service, think in terms of _resource sets_ . If you were to\\ndramatically scale out a specific service, what impact would that have on back-end data\\nstores, caches and dependent services? Some resources such as Cosmos DB can scale out\\nproportionally, while many others can\u2019t. You want to ensure that you don\u2019t scale out a\\nresource to a point where it will exhaust other associated resources.']\n\n['_Avoid affinity._ A best practice is to ensure a node doesn\u2019t require local affinity, often referred\\nto as a _sticky session_ . A request should be able to route to any instance. If you need to persist\\n[state, it should be saved to a distributed cache, such as Azure Redis cache.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache/)']\n\n['_Take advantage of platform autoscaling features._ Use built-in autoscaling features whenever\\npossible, rather than custom or third-party mechanisms. Where possible, use scheduled\\nscaling rules to ensure that resources are available without a startup delay, but add reactive\\nautoscaling to the rules as appropriate, to cope with unexpected changes in demand. For\\n[more information, see Autoscaling guidance.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/best-practices/auto-scaling)']\n\n['_Scale out aggressively._ A final practice would be to scale out aggressively so that you can\\nquickly meet immediate spikes in traffic without losing business. And, then scale in (that is,\\nremove unneeded instances) conservatively to keep the system stable. A simple way to\\nimplement this is to set the cool down period, which is the time to wait between scaling\\noperations, to five minutes for adding resources and up to 15 minutes for removing instances.']", "**Built-in retry in services**": "We encouraged the best practice of implementing programmatic retry operations in an earlier section.\nKeep in mind that many Azure services and their corresponding client SDKs also include retry\n\n121 CHAPTER 6 | Cloud-native resiliency\n\nmechanisms.

One of the most tried and true ways of capturing information\nabout what an application is doing while it\u2019s running is to have the application write down what it\u2019s\ndoing. This process is known as logging. Anytime failures or problems occur in production, the goal\nshould be to reproduce the conditions under which the failures occurred, in a non-production\nenvironment. Having good logging in place provides a roadmap for developers to follow in order to\nduplicate problems in an environment that can be tested and experimented with.\n\n**Challenges when logging with cloud-native applications**\n\nIn traditional applications, log files are typically stored on the local machine. In fact, on Unix-like\noperating systems, there\u2019s a folder structure defined to hold any logs, typically under /var/log.\n\n126 CHAPTER 7 | Monitoring and health\n\n_Figure 7-1. Logging to a file in a monolithic app._\n\nThe usefulness of logging to a flat file on a single machine is vastly reduced in a cloud environment.\nApplications producing logs may not have access to the local disk or the local disk may be highly\ntransient as containers are shuffled around physical machines. Even simple scaling up of monolithic\napplications across multiple nodes can make it challenging to locate the appropriate file-based log\nfile.\n\n_Figure 7-2. Logging to files in a scaled monolithic app._\n\nCloud-native applications developed using a microservices architecture also pose some challenges for\nfile-based loggers. User requests may now span multiple services that are run on different machines\n\n127 CHAPTER 7 | Monitoring and health\n\nand may include serverless functions with no access to a local file system at all. It would be very\nchallenging to correlate the logs from a user or a session across these many services and machines.\n\n_Figure 7-3. Logging to local files in a microservices app._\n\nFinally, the number of users in some cloud-native applications is high. Imagine that each user\ngenerates a hundred lines of log messages when they log into an application. In isolation, that is\nmanageable, but multiply that over 100,000 users and the volume of logs becomes large enough that\nspecialized tools are needed to support effective use of the logs.\n\n**Logging in cloud-native applications**\n\nEvery programming language has tooling that permits writing logs, and typically the overhead for\nwriting these logs is low. Many of the logging libraries provide logging different kinds of criticalities,\n[which can be tuned at run time. For instance, the Serilog library](https://serilog.net/) is a popular structured logging library\nfor .NET that provides the following logging levels:\n\n['Verbose', 'Debug', 'Information', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Fatal']\n\nThese different log levels provide granularity in logging. When the application is functioning properly\nin production, it may be configured to only log important messages. When the application is\n\n128 CHAPTER 7 | Monitoring and health\n\nmisbehaving, then the log level can be increased so more verbose logs are gathered. This balances\nperformance against ease of debugging.\n\nThe high performance of logging tools and the tunability of verbosity should encourage developers to\nlog frequently. Many favor a pattern of logging the entry and exit of each method. This approach may\nsound like overkill, but it\u2019s infrequent that developers will wish for less logging. In fact, it\u2019s not\nuncommon to perform deployments for the sole purpose of adding logging around a problematic\nmethod. Err on the side of too much logging and not on too little. Some tools can be used to\nautomatically provide this kind of logging.\n\nBecause of the challenges associated with using file-based logs in cloud-native apps, centralized logs\nare preferred. Logs are collected by the applications and shipped to a central logging application\nwhich indexes and stores the logs. This class of system can ingest tens of gigabytes of logs every day.\n\nIt\u2019s also helpful to follow some standard practices when building logging that spans many services.\n[For instance, generating a correlation ID](https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/12/23/the-value-of-correlation-ids/) at the start of a lengthy interaction, and then logging it in\neach message that is related to that interaction, makes it easier to search for all related messages. One\nneed only find a single message and extract the correlation ID to find all the related messages.\nAnother example is ensuring that the log format is the same for every service, whatever the language\nor logging library it uses. This standardization makes reading logs much easier. Figure 7-4\ndemonstrates how a microservices architecture can leverage centralized logging as part of its\nworkflow.\n\n_Figure 7-4. Logs from various sources are ingested into a centralized log store._\n\n129 CHAPTER 7 | Monitoring and health", "**Challenges with detecting and responding to potential app health** **issues**": "Some applications aren\u2019t mission critical. Maybe they\u2019re only used internally, and when a problem\noccurs, the user can contact the team responsible and the application can be restarted. However,\ncustomers often have higher expectations for the applications they consume. You should know when\nproblems occur with your application _before_ users do, or before users notify you. Otherwise, the first\nyou know about a problem may be when you notice an angry deluge of social media posts deriding\nyour application or even your organization.\n\nSome scenarios you may need to consider include:\n\n['One service in your application keeps failing and restarting, resulting in intermittent slow\\nresponses.', 'At some times of the day, your application\u2019s response time is slow.', 'After a recent deployment, load on the database has tripled.']\n\nImplemented properly, monitoring can let you know about conditions that will lead to problems,\nletting you address underlying conditions before they result in any significant user impact.\n\n**Monitoring cloud-native apps**\n\nSome centralized logging systems take on an additional role of collecting telemetry outside of pure\nlogs. They can collect metrics, such as time to run a database query, average response time from a\nweb server, and even CPU load averages and memory pressure as reported by the operating system.\nIn conjunction with the logs, these systems can provide a holistic view of the health of nodes in the\nsystem and the application as a whole.\n\nThe metric-gathering capabilities of the monitoring tools can also be fed manually from within the\napplication. Business flows that are of particular interest such as new users signing up or orders being\nplaced, may be instrumented such that they increment a counter in the central monitoring system.\nThis aspect unlocks the monitoring tools to not only monitor the health of the application but the\nhealth of the business.\n\nQueries can be constructed in the log aggregation tools to look for certain statistics or patterns, which\ncan then be displayed in graphical form, on custom dashboards. Frequently, teams will invest in large,\nwall-mounted displays that rotate through the statistics related to an application. This way, it\u2019s simple\nto see the problems as they occur.\n\nCloud-native monitoring tools provide real-time telemetry and insight into apps regardless of whether\nthey\u2019re single-process monolithic applications or distributed microservice architectures. They include\ntools that allow collection of data from the app as well as tools for querying and displaying\ninformation about the app\u2019s health.", "**Challenges with reacting to critical problems in cloud-native apps**": "If you need to react to problems with your application, you need some way to alert the right\npersonnel. This is the third cloud-native application observability pattern and depends on logging and\nmonitoring. Your application needs to have logging in place to allow problems to be diagnosed, and\n\n130 CHAPTER 7 | Monitoring and health\n\nin some cases to feed into monitoring tools. It needs monitoring to aggregate application metrics and\nhealth data in one place. Once this has been established, rules can be created that will trigger alerts\nwhen certain metrics fall outside of acceptable levels.\n\nGenerally, alerts are layered on top of monitoring such that certain conditions trigger appropriate\nalerts to notify team members of urgent problems. Some scenarios that may require alerts include:\n\n['One of your application\u2019s services is not responding after 1 minute of downtime.', 'Your application is returning unsuccessful HTTP responses to more than 1% of requests.', 'Your application\u2019s average response time for key endpoints exceeds 2000 ms.']\n\n**Alerts in cloud-native apps**\n\nYou can craft queries against the monitoring tools to look for known failure conditions. For instance,\nqueries could search through the incoming logs for indications of HTTP status code 500, which\nindicates a problem on a web server. As soon as one of these is detected, then an e-mail or an SMS\ncould be sent to the owner of the originating service who can begin to investigate.\n\nTypically, though, a single 500 error isn\u2019t enough to determine that a problem has occurred. It could\nmean that a user mistyped their password or entered some malformed data. The alert queries can be\ncrafted to only fire when a larger than average number of 500 errors are detected.\n\nOne of the most damaging patterns in alerting is to fire too many alerts for humans to investigate.\nService owners will rapidly become desensitized to errors that they\u2019ve previously investigated and\nfound to be benign.

Its user\ninterface streamlines data analysis so you can spend your time gleaning insights from your data\ninstead of fighting with a clunky interface. It supports a wide variety of inputs so as your distributed\napplication spans more and different kinds of services, you can expect to continue to be able to feed\nlog and metric data into the system. The Elastic Stack also supports fast searches even across large\ndata sets, making it possible even for large applications to log detailed data and still be able to have\nvisibility into it in a performant fashion.", "**Logstash**": "[The first component is Logstash. This tool is used to gather log information from a large variety of](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash)\ndifferent sources. For instance, Logstash can read logs from disk and also receive messages from\n[logging libraries like Serilog. Logstash can do some basic filtering and expansion on the logs as they](https://serilog.net/)\narrive. For instance, if your logs contain IP addresses then Logstash may be configured to do a\ngeographical lookup and obtain a country/region or even city of origin for that message.\n\nSerilog is a logging library for .NET languages, which allows for parameterized logging. Instead of\ngenerating a textual log message that embeds fields, parameters are kept separate. This library allows\nfor more intelligent filtering and searching.

Deploying on infrastructure as a service introduces\nsignificant management overhead forcing those who take that path to take ownership of all the tasks\nassociated with infrastructure as a service such as securing the machines and keeping up-to-date with\npatches.\n\nAn option with less overhead is to make use of one of the many Docker containers on which the\nElastic Stack has already been configured. These containers can be dropped into an existing\n[Kubernetes cluster and run alongside application code.

The more data\ngathered, the deeper the insights. Instrumenting systems has traditionally been difficult. Simple\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) was the gold standard protocol for collecting machine level\ninformation, but it required a great deal of knowledge and configuration. Fortunately, much of this\nhard work has been eliminated as the most common metrics are gathered automatically by Azure\nMonitor.\n\nApplication level metrics and events aren\u2019t possible to instrument automatically because they\u2019re\n[specific to the application being deployed. In order to gather these metrics, there are SDKs and APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics)\n[available](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics) to directly report such information, such as when a customer signs up or completes an order.\nExceptions can also be captured and reported back into Azure Monitor via Application Insights.

Alerts can trigger actions in Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/) unlocking near limitless possibilities for\nworkflows.\n\nAs common causes of alerts are identified, the alerts can be enhanced with details about the common\ncauses of the alerts and the steps to take to resolve them. Highly mature cloud-native application\ndeployments may opt to kick off self-healing tasks, which perform actions such as removing failing\nnodes from a scale set or triggering an autoscaling activity. Eventually it may no longer be necessary\nto wake up on-call personnel at 2AM to resolve a live-site issue as the system will be able to adjust\nitself to compensate or at least limp along until somebody arrives at work the next morning.\n\nAzure Monitor automatically leverages machine learning to understand the normal operating\nparameters of deployed applications. This approach enables it to detect services that are operating\noutside of their normal parameters. For instance, the typical weekday traffic on the site might be\n10,000 requests per minute. And then, on a given week, suddenly the number of requests hits a highly\n[unusual 20,000 requests per minute.

Security and secure thinking must be part of every step of\nthe development and operations story. When planning an application ask questions like:\n\n['What would be the impact of this data being lost?', 'How can we limit the damage from bad data being injected into this service?', 'Who should have access to this data?', 'Are there auditing policies in place around the development and release process?']\n\n[All these questions are part of a process called threat modeling. This process tries to answer the](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-threat-modeling-tool)\nquestion of what threats there are to the system, how likely the threats are, and the potential damage\nfrom them.\n\nOnce the list of threats has been established, you need to decide whether they\u2019re worth mitigating.\nSometimes a threat is so unlikely and expensive to plan for that it isn\u2019t worth spending energy on it.\nFor instance, some state level actor could inject changes into the design of a process that is used by\n[millions of devices. Now, instead of running a certain piece of code in Ring 3, that code is run in Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring)\n\n['This process allows an exploit that can bypass the hypervisor and run the attack code on the bare\\nmetal machines, allowing attacks on all the virtual machines that are running on that hardware.']\n\nThe altered processors are difficult to detect without a microscope and advanced knowledge of the on\nsilicon design of that processor. This scenario is unlikely to happen and expensive to mitigate, so\nprobably no threat model would recommend building exploit protection for it.\n\nMore likely threats, such as broken access controls permitting Id incrementing attacks (replacing Id=2\nwith Id=3 in the URL) or SQL injection, are more attractive to build protections against. The\nmitigations for these threats are quite reasonable to build and prevent embarrassing security holes\nthat smear the company\u2019s reputation.", "**Principle of least privilege**": "One of the founding ideas in computer security is the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP). It\u2019s actually a\nfoundational idea in most any form of security be it digital or physical. In short, the principle is that\nany user or process should have the smallest number of rights possible to execute its task.\n\nAs an example, think of the tellers at a bank: accessing the safe is an uncommon activity. So, the\naverage teller can\u2019t open the safe themselves. To gain access, they need to escalate their request\nthrough a bank manager, who performs additional security checks.\n\nIn a computer system, a fantastic example is the rights of a user connecting to a database. In many\ncases, there\u2019s a single user account used to both build the database structure and run the application.\nExcept in extreme cases, the account running the application doesn\u2019t need the ability to update\nschema information. There should be several accounts that provide different levels of privilege. The\napplication should only use the permission level that grants read and writes access to the data in the\ntables. This kind of protection would eliminate attacks that aimed to drop database tables or\nintroduce malicious triggers.\n\n148 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\nAlmost every part of building a cloud-native application can benefit from remembering the principle\nof least privilege. You can find it at play when setting up firewalls, network security groups, roles, and\nscopes in Role-based access control (RBAC).", "**Penetration testing**": "As applications become more complicated the number of attack vectors increases at an alarming rate.\nThreat modeling is flawed in that it tends to be executed by the same people building the system. In\nthe same way that many developers have trouble envisioning user interactions and then build\nunusable user interfaces, most developers have difficulty seeing every attack vector. It\u2019s also possible\nthat the developers building the system aren\u2019t well versed in attack methodologies and miss\nsomething crucial.\n\nPenetration testing or \u201cpen testing\u201d involves bringing in external actors to attempt to attack the\nsystem. These attackers may be an external consulting company or other developers with good\nsecurity knowledge from another part of the business. They\u2019re given carte blanche to attempt to\nsubvert the system. Frequently, they\u2019ll find extensive security holes that need to be patched.\nSometimes the attack vector will be something totally unexpected like exploiting a phishing attack\nagainst the CEO.\n\n[Azure itself is constantly undergoing attacks from a team of hackers inside Microsoft. Over the years,](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/videos/red-vs-blue-internal-security-penetration-testing-of-microsoft-azure/)\nthey\u2019ve been the first to find dozens of potentially catastrophic attack vectors, closing them before\nthey can be exploited externally.

Attacks leave telltale signs\nthat can be spotted before they succeed. For instance, an attacker attempting to guess a password\nwill make many requests to a login system. Monitoring around the login system can detect weird\npatterns that are out of line with the typical access pattern. This monitoring can be turned into an\nalert that can, in turn, alert an operations person to activate some sort of countermeasure. A highly\nmature monitoring system might even take action based on these deviations proactively adding rules\nto block requests or throttle responses.", "**Securing the build**": "One place where security is often overlooked is around the build process. Not only should the build\nrun security checks, such as scanning for insecure code or checked-in credentials, but the build itself\nshould be secure. If the build server is compromised, then it provides a fantastic vector for introducing\narbitrary code into the product.\n\nImagine that an attacker is looking to steal the passwords of people signing into a web application.\nThey could introduce a build step that modifies the checked-out code to mirror any login request to\nanother server. The next time code goes through the build, it\u2019s silently updated. The source code\nvulnerability scanning won\u2019t catch this vulnerability as it runs before the build. Equally, nobody will\n\n149 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\ncatch it in a code review because the build steps live on the build server. The exploited code will go to\nproduction where it can harvest passwords. Probably there\u2019s no audit log of the build process\nchanges, or at least nobody monitoring the audit.\n\nThis scenario is a perfect example of a seemingly low-value target that can be used to break into the\nsystem. Once an attacker breaches the perimeter of the system, they can start working on finding\nways to elevate their permissions to the point that they can cause real harm anywhere they like.", "**Building secure code**": ".NET Framework is already a quite secure framework.

Some of these recommendations are designed to save users money, but\nothers are designed to identify potentially insecure configurations, such as having a storage container\nopen to the world and not protected by a Virtual Network.", "**Azure network infrastructure**": "In an on-premises deployment environment, a great deal of energy is dedicated to setting up\nnetworking. Setting up routers, switches, and the such is complicated work. Networks allow certain\nresources to talk to other resources and prevent access in some cases. A frequent network rule is to\nrestrict access to the production environment from the development environment on the off chance\nthat a half-developed piece of code runs awry and deletes a swath of data.\n\nOut of the box, most PaaS Azure resources have only the most basic and permissive networking setup.\nFor instance, anybody on the Internet can access an app service. New SQL Server instances typically\n\n150 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\ncome restricted, so that external parties can\u2019t access them, but the IP address ranges used by Azure\nitself are permitted through. So, while the SQL server is protected from external threats, an attacker\nonly needs to set up an Azure bridgehead from where they can launch attacks against all SQL\ninstances on Azure.\n\nFortunately, most Azure resources can be placed into an Azure Virtual Network that allows finegrained access control. Similar to the way that on-premises networks establish private networks that\nare protected from the wider world, virtual networks are islands of private IP addresses that are\nlocated within the Azure network.\n\n_Figure 9-1. A virtual network in Azure._\n\nIn the same way that on-premises networks have a firewall governing access to the network, you can\nestablish a similar firewall at the boundary of the virtual network. By default, all the resources on a\nvirtual network can still talk to the Internet. It\u2019s only incoming connections that require some form of\nexplicit firewall exception.\n\nWith the network established, internal resources like storage accounts can be set up to only allow for\naccess by resources that are also on the Virtual Network. This firewall provides an extra level of\nsecurity, should the keys for that storage account be leaked, attackers wouldn\u2019t be able to connect to\nit to exploit the leaked keys. This scenario is another example of the principle of least privilege.\n\nThe nodes in an Azure Kubernetes cluster can participate in a virtual network just like other resources\n[that are more native to Azure. This functionality is called Azure Container Networking Interface. In](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md)\neffect, it allocates a subnet within the virtual network on which virtual machines and container images\nare allocated.\n\nContinuing down the path of illustrating the principle of least privilege, not every resource within a\nVirtual Network needs to talk to every other resource. For instance, in an application that provides a\n\n151 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\nweb API over a storage account and a SQL database, it\u2019s unlikely that the database and the storage\naccount need to talk to one another. Any data sharing between them would go through the web\n[application. So, a network security group (NSG) could be used to deny traffic between the two](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview)\nservices.\n\nA policy of denying communication between resources can be annoying to implement, especially\ncoming from a background of using Azure without traffic restrictions. On some other clouds, the\nconcept of network security groups is much more prevalent. For instance, the default policy on AWS is\nthat resources can\u2019t communicate among themselves until enabled by rules in an NSG. While slower\nto develop this, a more restrictive environment provides a more secure default. Making use of proper\nDevOps practices, especially using Azure Resource Manager or Terraform to manage permissions can\nmake controlling the rules easier.\n\nVirtual Networks can also be useful when setting up communication between on-premises and cloud\nresources. A virtual private network can be used to seamlessly attach the two networks together. This\napproach allows running a virtual network without any sort of gateway for scenarios where all the\nusers are on-site. There are a number of technologies that can be used to establish this network. The\n[simplest is to use a site-to-site VPN that can be established between many routers and Azure. Traffic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways?toc=%252fazure%252fvirtual-network%252ftoc.json#s2smulti)\nis encrypted and tunneled over the Internet at the same cost per byte as any other traffic. For\n[scenarios where more bandwidth or more security is desirable, Azure offers a service called Express](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways?toc=%252fazure%252fvirtual-network%252ftoc.json#ExpressRoute)\n[Route](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways?toc=%252fazure%252fvirtual-network%252ftoc.json#ExpressRoute) that uses a private circuit between an on-premises network and Azure. It\u2019s more costly and\ndifficult to establish but also more secure.", "**Role-based access control for restricting access to Azure resources**": "RBAC is a system that provides an identity to applications running in Azure. Applications can access\nresources using this identity instead of or in addition to using keys or passwords.", "**Security Principals**": "The first component in RBAC is a security principal. A security principal can be a user, group, service\nprincipal, or managed identity.\n\n_Figure 9-2. Different types of security principals._\n\n['User - Any user who has an account in Azure Active Directory is a user.', 'Group - A collection of users from Azure Active Directory. As a member of a group, a user\\ntakes on the roles of that group in addition to their own.', 'Service principal - A security identity under which services or applications run.']\n\n152 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\n['Managed identity - An Azure Active Directory identity managed by Azure. Managed identities\\nare typically used when developing cloud applications that manage the credentials for\\nauthenticating to Azure services.']\n\nThe security principal can be applied to most any resource. This aspect means that it\u2019s possible to\nassign a security principal to a container running within Azure Kubernetes, allowing it to access secrets\nstored in Key Vault. An Azure Function could take on a permission allowing it to talk to an Active\nDirectory instance to validate a JWT for a calling user. Once services are enabled with a service\nprincipal, their permissions can be managed granularly using roles and scopes.", "**Roles**": "A security principal can take on many roles or, using a more sartorial analogy, wear many hats. Each\nrole defines a series of permissions such as \u201cRead messages from Azure Service Bus endpoint\u201d. The\neffective permission set of a security principal is the combination of all the permissions assigned to all\nthe roles that a security principal has. Azure has a large number of built-in roles and users can define\ntheir own roles.\n\n_Figure 9-3. RBAC role definitions._\n\nBuilt into Azure are also a number of high-level roles such as Owner, Contributor, Reader, and User\nAccount Administrator. With the Owner role, a security principal can access all resources and assign\npermissions to others. A contributor has the same level of access to all resources but they can\u2019t assign\npermissions. A Reader can only view existing Azure resources and a User Account Administrator can\nmanage access to Azure resources.\n\n[More granular built-in roles such as DNS Zone Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#dns-zone-contributor) have rights limited to a single service.\nSecurity principals can take on any number of roles.\n\n153 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security", "**Scopes**": "Roles can be applied to a restricted set of resources within Azure. For instance, applying scope to the\nprevious example of reading from a Service Bus queue, you can narrow the permission to a single\nqueue: \u201cRead messages from Azure Service Bus endpoint blah.servicebus.windows.net/queue1\u201d\n\nThe scope can be as narrow as a single resource or it can be applied to an entire resource group,\nsubscription, or even management group.\n\nWhen testing if a security principal has certain permission, the combination of role and scope are\ntaken into account. This combination provides a powerful authorization mechanism.", "**Deny**": "Previously, only \u201callow\u201d rules were permitted for RBAC. This behavior made some scopes complicated\nto build. For instance, allowing a security principal access to all storage accounts except one required\ngranting explicit permission to a potentially endless list of storage accounts. Every time a new storage\naccount was created, it would have to be added to this list of accounts. This added management\noverhead that certainly wasn\u2019t desirable.\n\nDeny rules take precedence over allow rules. Now representing the same \u201callow all but one\u201d scope\ncould be represented as two rules \u201callow all\u201d and \u201cdeny this one specific one\u201d. Deny rules not only\nease management but allow for resources that are extra secure by denying access to everybody.", "**Checking access**": "As you can imagine, having a large number of roles and scopes can make figuring out the effective\npermission of a service principal quite difficult. Piling deny rules on top of that, only serves to increase\n[the complexity. Fortunately, there\u2019s a permissions calculator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/check-access) that can show the effective permissions\nfor any service principal. It\u2019s typically found under the IAM tab in the portal, as shown in Figure 9-3.\n\n_Figure 9-4. Permission calculator for an app service._\n\n154 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security", "**Securing secrets**": "Passwords and certificates are a common attack vector for attackers. Password-cracking hardware can\ndo a brute-force attack and try to guess billions of passwords per second. So it\u2019s important that the\npasswords that are used to access resources are strong, with a large variety of characters. These\npasswords are exactly the kind of passwords that are near impossible to remember. Fortunately, the\npasswords in Azure don\u2019t actually need to be known by any human.\n\n[Many security experts suggest that using a password manager to keep your own passwords is the](https://www.troyhunt.com/password-managers-dont-have-to-be-perfect-they-just-have-to-be-better-than-not-having-one/)\nbest approach. While it centralizes your passwords in one location, it also allows using highly complex\npasswords and ensuring they\u2019re unique for each account. The same system exists within Azure: a\ncentral store for secrets.", "**Azure Key Vault**": "Azure Key Vault provides a centralized location to store passwords for things such as databases, API\nkeys, and certificates. Once a secret is entered into the Vault, it\u2019s never shown again and the\ncommands to extract and view it are purposefully complicated. The information in the safe is\nprotected using either software encryption or FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated Hardware Security\nModules.\n\nAccess to the key vault is provided through RBACs, meaning that not just any user can access the\ninformation in the vault. Say a web application wishes to access the database connection string stored\nin Azure Key Vault. To gain access, applications need to run using a service principal. Under this\nassumed role, they can read the secrets from the safe. There are a number of different security\nsettings that can further limit the access that an application has to the vault, so that it can\u2019t update\nsecrets but only read them.\n\nAccess to the key vault can be monitored to ensure that only the expected applications are accessing\nthe vault. The logs can be integrated back into Azure Monitor, unlocking the ability to set up alerts\nwhen unexpected conditions are encountered.", "**Kubernetes**": "Within Kubernetes, there\u2019s a similar service for maintaining small pieces of secret information.\nKubernetes Secrets can be set via the typical kubectl executable.\n\nCreating a secret is as simple as finding the base64 version of the values to be stored:\n\nThen adding it to a secrets file named secret.yml for example that looks similar to the following\nexample:\n\n155 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\nFinally, this file can be loaded into Kubernetes by running the following command:\n\n```\nkubectl apply -f ./secret.yaml\n\n```\n\nThese secrets can then be mounted into volumes or exposed to container processes through\n[environment variables. The Twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/) approach to building applications suggests using the\nlowest common denominator to transmit settings to an application. Environment variables are the\nlowest common denominator, because they\u2019re supported no matter the operating system or\napplication.\n\nAn alternative to use the built-in Kubernetes secrets is to access the secrets in Azure Key Vault from\nwithin Kubernetes. The simplest way to do this is to assign an RBAC role to the container looking to\nload secrets. The application can then use the Azure Key Vault APIs to access the secrets. However,\nthis approach requires modifications to the code and doesn\u2019t follow the pattern of using environment\nvariables. Instead, it\u2019s possible to inject values into a container. This approach is actually more secure\nthan using the Kubernetes secrets directly, as they can be accessed by users on the cluster.", "**Encryption in transit and at rest**": "Keeping data safe is important whether it\u2019s on disk or transiting between various different services.\nThe most effective way to keep data from leaking is to encrypt it into a format that can\u2019t be easily read\nby others. Azure supports a wide range of encryption options.\n\n**In transit**\n\nThere are several ways to encrypt traffic on the network in Azure. The access to Azure services is\ntypically done over connections that use Transport Layer Security (TLS). For instance, all the\nconnections to the Azure APIs require TLS connections. Equally, connections to endpoints in Azure\nstorage can be restricted to work only over TLS encrypted connections.\n\nTLS is a complicated protocol and simply knowing that the connection is using TLS isn\u2019t sufficient to\nensure security. For instance, TLS 1.0 is chronically insecure, and TLS 1.1 isn\u2019t much better. Even within\nthe versions of TLS, there are various settings that can make the connections easier to decrypt. The\nbest course of action is to check and see if the server connection is using up-to-date and well\nconfigured protocols.\n\nThis check can be done by an external service such as SSL labs\u2019 SSL Server Test. A test run against a\ntypical Azure endpoint, in this case a service bus endpoint, yields a near perfect score of A.\n\nEven services like Azure SQL databases use TLS encryption to keep data hidden. The interesting part\nabout encrypting the data in transit using TLS is that it isn\u2019t possible, even for Microsoft, to listen in on\nthe connection between computers running TLS. This should provide comfort for companies\nconcerned that their data may be at risk from Microsoft proper or even a state actor with more\nresources than the standard attacker.\n\n156 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\n_Figure 9-5. SSL labs report showing a score of A for a Service Bus endpoint._\n\nWhile this level of encryption isn\u2019t going to be sufficient for all time, it should inspire confidence that\nAzure TLS connections are quite secure. Azure will continue to evolve its security standards as\nencryption improves. It\u2019s nice to know that there\u2019s somebody watching the security standards and\nupdating Azure as they improve.\n\n**At rest**\n\nIn any application, there are a number of places where data rests on the disk. The application code\nitself is loaded from some storage mechanism. Most applications also use some kind of a database\nsuch as SQL Server, Cosmos DB, or even the amazingly price-efficient Table Storage. These databases\nall use heavily encrypted storage to ensure that nobody other than the applications with proper\npermissions can read your data. Even the system operators can\u2019t read data that has been encrypted.\nSo customers can remain confident their secret information remains secret.\n\n**Storage**\n\nThe underpinning of much of Azure is the Azure Storage engine. Virtual machine disks are mounted\non top of Azure Storage. Azure Kubernetes Service runs on virtual machines that, themselves, are\nhosted on Azure Storage. Even serverless technologies, such as Azure Functions Apps and Azure\nContainer Instances, run out of disk that is part of Azure Storage.\n\nIf Azure Storage is well encrypted, then it provides for a foundation for most everything else to also\n[be encrypted. Azure Storage is encrypted](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption) [with FIPS 140-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140) [compliant 256-bit AES. This is a well-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)\nregarded encryption technology having been the subject of extensive academic scrutiny over the last\n20 or so years. At present, there\u2019s no known practical attack that would allow someone without\nknowledge of the key to read data encrypted by AES.\n\nBy default, the keys used for encrypting Azure Storage are managed by Microsoft. There are extensive\nprotections in place to ensure to prevent malicious access to these keys. However, users with\n[particular encryption requirements can also provide their own storage keys that are managed in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-encryption-keys-powershell)\n\n157 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\nKey Vault. These keys can be revoked at any time, which would effectively render the contents of the\nStorage account using them inaccessible.\n\nVirtual machines use encrypted storage, but it\u2019s possible to provide another layer of encryption by\nusing technologies like BitLocker on Windows or DM-Crypt on Linux. These technologies mean that\neven if the disk image was leaked off of storage, it would remain near impossible to read it.\n\n**Azure SQL**\n\n[Databases hosted on Azure SQL use a technology called Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) to ensure](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption)\ndata remains encrypted. It\u2019s enabled by default on all newly created SQL databases, but must be\nenabled manually for legacy databases. TDE executes real-time encryption and decryption of not just\nthe database, but also the backups and transaction logs.\n\nThe encryption parameters are stored in the master database and, on startup, are read into memory\nfor the remaining operations. This means that the master database must remain unencrypted. The\nactual key is managed by Microsoft. However, users with exacting security requirements may provide\ntheir own key in Key Vault in much the same way as is done for Azure Storage. The Key Vault provides\nfor such services as key rotation and revocation.\n\nThe \u201cTransparent\u201d part of TDS comes from the fact that there aren\u2019t client changes needed to use an\nencrypted database. While this approach provides for good security, leaking the database password is\nenough for users to be able to decrypt the data. There\u2019s another approach that encrypts individual\n[columns or tables in a database. Always Encrypted](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-always-encrypted-azure-key-vault) ensures that at no point the encrypted data\nappears in plain text inside the database.\n\nSetting up this tier of encryption requires running through a wizard in SQL Server Management Studio\nto select the sort of encryption and where in Key Vault to store the associated keys.\n\n158 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\n_Figure 9-6. Selecting columns in a table to be encrypted using Always Encrypted._\n\nClient applications that read information from these encrypted columns need to make special\nallowances to read encrypted data. Connection strings need to be updated with Column Encryption\nSetting=Enabled and client credentials must be retrieved from the Key Vault. The SQL Server client\nmust then be primed with the column encryption keys. Once that is done, the remaining actions use\nthe standard interfaces to SQL Client. That is, tools like Dapper and Entity Framework, which are built\non top of SQL Client, will continue to work without changes. Always Encrypted may not yet be\navailable for every SQL Server driver on every language.\n\nThe combination of TDE and Always Encrypted, both of which can be used with client-specific keys,\nensures that even the most exacting encryption requirements are supported.\n\n**Cosmos DB**\n\nCosmos DB is the newest database provided by Microsoft in Azure. It has been built from the ground\nup with security and cryptography in mind. AES-256bit encryption is standard for all Cosmos DB\n\n159 CHAPTER 9 | Cloud-native security\n\ndatabases and can\u2019t be disabled. Coupled with the TLS 1.2 requirement for communication, the entire\nstorage solution is encrypted.\n\n_Figure 9-7. The flow of data encryption within Cosmos DB._\n\nWhile Cosmos DB doesn\u2019t provide for supplying customer encryption keys, there has been significant\nwork done by the team to ensure it remains PCI-DSS compliant without that. Cosmos DB also doesn\u2019t\nsupport any sort of single column encryption similar to Azure SQL\u2019s Always Encrypted yet.", "**Keeping secure**": "Azure has all the tools necessary to release a highly secure product.

It can trace its roots back to when Team Foundation Server first\nmoved online and through the various name changes: Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Team\nServices. Through the years, however, it has become far more than its predecessors.\n\nAzure DevOps is divided into five major components:\n\n_Figure 10-2 - Azure DevOps._\n\n**Azure Repos** - Source code management that supports the venerable Team Foundation Version\n[Control (TFVC) and the industry favorite Git. Pull requests provide a way to enable social coding by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)\nfostering discussion of changes as they\u2019re made.\n\n162 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\n**Azure Boards** - Provides an issue and work item tracking tool that strives to allow users to pick the\nworkflows that work best for them. It comes with a number of pre-configured templates including\nones to support SCRUM and Kanban styles of development.\n\n**Azure Pipelines** - A build and release management system that supports tight integration with Azure.\nBuilds can be run on various platforms from Windows to Linux to macOS. Build agents may be\nprovisioned in the cloud or on-premises.\n\n**Azure Test Plans** - No QA person will be left behind with the test management and exploratory\ntesting support offered by the Test Plans feature.\n\n**Azure Artifacts** - An artifact feed that allows companies to create their own, internal, versions of\nNuGet, npm, and others. It serves a double purpose of acting as a cache of upstream packages if\nthere\u2019s a failure of a centralized repository.\n\nThe top-level organizational unit in Azure DevOps is known as a Project. Within each project the\nvarious components, such as Azure Artifacts, can be turned on and off. Each of these components\nprovides different advantages for cloud-native applications. The three most useful are repositories,\nboards, and pipelines. If users want to manage their source code in another repository stack, such as\nGitHub, but still take advantage of Azure Pipelines and other components, that\u2019s perfectly possible.\n\nFortunately, development teams have many options when selecting a repository. One of them is\nGitHub.", "GitHub Actions": "Founded in 2009, GitHub is a widely popular web-based repository for hosting projects,\ndocumentation, and code. Many large tech companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and\nmainstream corporations use GitHub. GitHub uses the open-source, distributed version control system\nnamed Git as its foundation. On top, it then adds its own set of features, including defect tracking,\nfeature and pull requests, tasks management, and wikis for each code base.\n\nAs GitHub evolves, it too is adding DevOps features. For example, GitHub has its own continuous\nintegration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, called GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is a\ncommunity-powered workflow automation tool. It lets DevOps teams integrate with their existing\ntooling, mix and match new products, and hook into their software lifecycle, including existing CI/CD\npartners.\u201d\n\nGitHub has over 40 million users, making it the largest host of source code in the world. In October of\n[2018, Microsoft purchased GitHub. Microsoft has pledged that GitHub will remain an open platform](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-promises-to-keep-github-independent-and-open/)\nthat any developer can plug into and extend. It continues to operate as an independent company.\nGitHub offers plans for enterprise, team, professional, and free accounts.", "Source control": {"**Repository per microservice**": "At first glance, this approach seems like the most logical approach to splitting up the source code for\nmicroservices. Each repository can contain the code needed to build the one microservice. The\nadvantages to this approach are readily visible:\n\n['Instructions for building and maintaining the application can be added to a README file at\\nthe root of each repository. When flipping through the repositories, it\u2019s easy to find these\\ninstructions, reducing spin-up time for developers.', 'Every service is located in a logical place, easily found by knowing the name of the service.', 'Builds can easily be set up such that they\u2019re only triggered when a change is made to the\\nowning repository.', 'The number of changes coming into a repository is limited to the small number of developers\\nworking on the project.']\n\n164 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\n['Security is easy to set up by restricting the repositories to which developers have read and\\nwrite permissions.', 'Repository level settings can be changed by the owning team with a minimum of discussion\\nwith others.']\n\nOne of the key ideas behind microservices is that services should be siloed and separated from each\nother. When using Domain Driven Design to decide on the boundaries for services the services act as\ntransactional boundaries. Database updates shouldn\u2019t span multiple services. This collection of related\ndata is referred to as a bounded context. This idea is reflected by the isolation of microservice data to\na database separate and autonomous from the rest of the services. It makes a great deal of sense to\ncarry this idea all the way through to the source code.\n\nHowever, this approach isn\u2019t without its issues. One of the more gnarly development problems of our\ntime is managing dependencies. Consider the number of files that make up the average\nnode_modules directory. A fresh install of something like create-react-app is likely to bring with it\nthousands of packages. The question of how to manage these dependencies is a difficult one.\n\nIf a dependency is updated, then downstream packages must also update this dependency.\nUnfortunately, that takes development work so, invariably, the node_modules directory ends up with\nmultiple versions of a single package, each one a dependency of some other package that is\nversioned at a slightly different cadence. When deploying an application, which version of a\ndependency should be used? The version that is currently in production? The version that is currently\nin Beta but is likely to be in production by the time the consumer makes it to production? Difficult\nproblems that aren\u2019t resolved by just using microservices.\n\nThere are libraries that are depended upon by a wide variety of projects. By dividing the microservices\nup with one in each repository the internal dependencies can best be resolved by using the internal\nrepository, Azure Artifacts. Builds for libraries will push their latest versions into Azure Artifacts for\ninternal consumption. The downstream project must still be manually updated to take a dependency\non the newly updated packages.\n\nAnother disadvantage presents itself when moving code between services. Although it would be nice\nto believe that the first division of an application into microservices is 100% correct, the reality is that\nrarely we\u2019re so prescient as to make no service division mistakes. Thus, functionality and the code that\ndrives it will need to move from service to service: repository to repository. When leaping from one\nrepository to another, the code loses its history. There are many cases, especially in the event of an\naudit, where having full history on a piece of code is invaluable.\n\nThe final and most important disadvantage is coordinating changes. In a true microservices\napplication, there should be no deployment dependencies between services. It should be possible to\ndeploy services A, B, and C in any order as they have loose coupling. In reality, however, there are\ntimes when it\u2019s desirable to make a change that crosses multiple repositories at the same time. Some\nexamples include updating a library to close a security hole or changing a communication protocol\nused by all services.\n\nTo do a cross-repository change requires a commit to each repository be made in succession. Each\nchange in each repository will need to be pull-requested and reviewed separately. This activity can be\ndifficult to coordinate.\n\n165 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\nAn alternative to using many repositories is to put all the source code together in a giant, all knowing,\nsingle repository.", "**Single repository**": "[In this approach, sometimes referred to as a monorepository, all the source code for every service is](https://danluu.com/monorepo/)\nput into the same repository. At first, this approach seems like a terrible idea likely to make dealing\nwith source code unwieldy. There are, however, some marked advantages to working this way.\n\nThe first advantage is that it\u2019s easier to manage dependencies between projects. Instead of relying on\nsome external artifact feed, projects can directly import one another. This means that updates are\ninstant, and conflicting versions are likely to be found at compile time on the developer\u2019s workstation.\nIn effect, shifting some of the integration testing left.\n\nWhen moving code between projects, it\u2019s now easier to preserve the history as the files will be\ndetected as having been moved rather than being rewritten.\n\nAnother advantage is that wide ranging changes that cross service boundaries can be made in a\nsingle commit. This activity reduces the overhead of having potentially dozens of changes to review\nindividually.\n\nThere are many tools that can perform static analysis of code to detect insecure programming\npractices or problematic use of APIs. In a multi-repository world, each repository will need to be\niterated over to find the problems in them. The single repository allows running the analysis all in one\nplace.\n\nThere are also many disadvantages to the single repository approach. One of the most worrying ones\nis that having a single repository raises security concerns. If the contents of a repository are leaked in\na repository per service model, the amount of code lost is minimal. With a single repository,\neverything the company owns could be lost. There have been many examples in the past of this\nhappening and derailing entire game development efforts. Having multiple repositories exposes less\nsurface area, which is a desirable trait in most security practices.\n\nThe size of the single repository is likely to become unmanageable rapidly. This presents some\n[interesting performance implications. It may become necessary to use specialized tools such as Virtual](https://github.com/Microsoft/VFSForGit)\n[File System for Git, which was originally designed to improve the experience for developers on the](https://github.com/Microsoft/VFSForGit)\nWindows team.\n\nFrequently the argument for using a single repository boils down to an argument that Facebook or\nGoogle use this method for source code arrangement. If the approach is good enough for these\ncompanies, then, surely, it\u2019s the correct approach for all companies. The truth of the matter is that few\ncompanies operate on anything like the scale of Facebook or Google. The problems that occur at\nthose scales are different from those most developers will face. What is good for the goose may not\nbe good for the gander.\n\nIn the end, either solution can be used to host the source code for microservices. However, in most\ncases, the management, and engineering overhead of operating in a single repository isn\u2019t worth the\nmeager advantages. Splitting code up over multiple repositories encourages better separation of\nconcerns and encourages autonomy among development teams.\n\n166 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps", "**Standard directory structure**": "Regardless of the single versus multiple repositories debate each service will have its own directory.\nOne of the best optimizations to allow developers to cross between projects quickly is to maintain a\nstandard directory structure.\n\n_Figure 10-4 - Standard directory structure._\n\nWhenever a new project is created, a template that puts in place the correct structure should be used.\nThis template can also include such useful items as a skeleton README file and an azurepipelines.yml. In any microservice architecture, a high degree of variance between projects makes bulk\noperations against the services more difficult.\n\nThere are many tools that can provide templating for an entire directory, containing several source\n[code directories. Yeoman is popular in the JavaScript world and GitHub have recently released](https://yeoman.io/)\n[Repository Templates, which provide much of the same functionality.](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/)"}, "Task management": "Managing tasks in any project can be difficult. Up front there are countless questions to be answered\nabout the sort of workflows to set up to ensure optimal developer productivity.\n\nCloud-native applications tend to be smaller than traditional software products or at least they\u2019re\ndivided into smaller services. Tracking of issues or tasks related to these services remains as important\nas with any other software project. Nobody wants to lose track of some work item or explain to a\ncustomer that their issue wasn\u2019t properly logged. Boards are configured at the project level but within\neach project, areas can be defined. These allow breaking down issues across several components. The\nadvantage to keeping all the work for the entire application in one place is that it\u2019s easy to move work\nitems from one team to another as they\u2019re understood better.\n\n167 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\nAzure DevOps comes with a number of popular templates pre-configured. In the most basic\nconfiguration, all that is needed to know is what\u2019s in the backlog, what people are working on, and\nwhat\u2019s done. It\u2019s important to have this visibility into the process of building software, so that work\ncan be prioritized and completed tasks reported to the customer. Of course, few software projects\nstick to a process as simple as to do, doing, and done. It doesn\u2019t take long for people to start adding\nsteps like QA or Detailed Specification to the process.\n\nOne of the more important parts of Agile methodologies is self-introspection at regular intervals.\nThese reviews are meant to provide insight into what problems the team is facing and how they can\nbe improved. Frequently, this means changing the flow of issues and features through the\ndevelopment process. So, it\u2019s perfectly healthy to expand the layouts of the boards with additional\nstages.\n\nThe stages in the boards aren\u2019t the only organizational tool. Depending on the configuration of the\nboard, there\u2019s a hierarchy of work items. The most granular item that can appear on a board is a task.\nOut of the box a task contains fields for a title, description, a priority, an estimate of the amount of\nwork remaining and the ability to link to other work items or development items (branches, commits,\npull requests, builds, and so forth). Work items can be classified into different areas of the application\nand different iterations (sprints) to make finding them easier.\n\n_Figure 10-5 - Task in Azure DevOps._\n\nThe description field supports the normal styles you\u2019d expect (bold, italic underscore and strike\nthrough) and the ability to insert images. This makes it a powerful tool for use when specifying work\nor bugs.\n\n[Tasks can be rolled up into features, which define a larger unit of work. Features, in turn, can be rolled](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/define-features-epics?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true)\n[up into epics. Classifying tasks in this hierarchy makes it much easier to understand how close a large](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/define-features-epics?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true)\nfeature is to rolling out.\n\n168 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\n_Figure 10-6 - Work item in Azure DevOps._\n\nThere are different kinds of views into the issues in Azure Boards. Items that aren\u2019t yet scheduled\nappear in the backlog. From there, they can be assigned to a sprint. A sprint is a time box during\nwhich it\u2019s expected some quantity of work will be completed. This work can include tasks but also the\nresolution of tickets. Once there, the entire sprint can be managed from the Sprint board section. This\nview shows how work is progressing and includes a burn down chart to give an ever-updating\nestimate of if the sprint will be successful.\n\n_Figure 10-7 - Board in Azure DevOps._\n\nBy now, it should be apparent that there\u2019s a great deal of power in the Boards in Azure DevOps. For\ndevelopers, there are easy views of what is being worked on. For project managers views into\nupcoming work as well as an overview of existing work. For managers, there are plenty of reports\nabout resourcing and capacity. Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing magical about cloud-native applications\nthat eliminate the need to track work. But if you must track work, there are a few places where the\nexperience is better than in Azure DevOps.", "CI/CD pipelines": {"**Azure Builds**": "Azure DevOps provides a set of tools to make continuous integration and deployment easier than\never. These tools are located under Azure Pipelines. The first of them is Azure Builds, which is a tool\nfor running YAML-based build definitions at scale. Users can either bring their own build machines\n(great for if the build requires a meticulously set up environment) or use a machine from a constantly\nrefreshed pool of Azure hosted virtual machines. These hosted build agents come pre-installed with a\n\n170 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\nwide range of development tools for not just .NET development but for everything from Java to\nPython to iPhone development.\n\nDevOps includes a wide range of out of the box build definitions that can be customized for any build.\nThe build definitions are defined in a file called azure-pipelines.yml and checked into the repository so\nthey can be versioned along with the source code. This makes it much easier to make changes to the\nbuild pipeline in a branch as the changes can be checked into just that branch. An example azurepipelines.yml for building an ASP.NET web application on full framework is show in Figure 10-9.\n\n171 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\n_Figure 10-9 - A sample azure-pipelines.yml_\n\nThis build definition uses a number of built-in tasks that make creating builds as simple as building a\nLego set (simpler than the giant Millennium Falcon). For instance, the NuGet task restores NuGet\npackages, while the VSBuild task calls the Visual Studio build tools to perform the actual compilation.\nThere are hundreds of different tasks available in Azure DevOps, with thousands more that are\nmaintained by the community. It\u2019s likely that no matter what build tasks you\u2019re looking to run,\nsomebody has built one already.\n\nBuilds can be triggered manually, by a check-in, on a schedule, or by the completion of another build.\nIn most cases, building on every check-in is desirable. Builds can be filtered so that different builds run\nagainst different parts of the repository or against different branches. This allows for scenarios like\nrunning fast builds with reduced testing on pull requests and running a full regression suite against\nthe trunk on a nightly basis.\n\nThe end result of a build is a collection of files known as build artifacts. These artifacts can be passed\nalong to the next step in the build process or added to an Azure Artifacts feed, so they can be\nconsumed by other builds.", "**Azure DevOps releases**": "Builds take care of compiling the software into a shippable package, but the artifacts still need to be\npushed out to a testing environment to complete continuous delivery. For this, Azure DevOps uses a\nseparate tool called Releases. The Releases tool makes use of the same tasks\u2019 library that were\navailable to the Build but introduce a concept of \u201cstages\u201d. A stage is an isolated environment into\nwhich the package is installed. For instance, a product might make use of a development, a QA, and a\nproduction environment. Code is continuously delivered into the development environment where\nautomated tests can be run against it. Once those tests pass the release moves onto the QA\nenvironment for manual testing. Finally, the code is pushed to production where it\u2019s visible to\neverybody.\n\n_Figure 10-10 - Release pipeline_\n\nEach stage in the build can be automatically triggered by the completion of the previous phase. In\nmany cases, however, this isn\u2019t desirable. Moving code into production might require approval from\nsomebody. The Releases tool supports this by allowing approvers at each step of the release pipeline.\nRules can be set up such that a specific person or group of people must sign off on a release before it\n\n172 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\nmakes into production. These gates allow for manual quality checks and also for compliance with any\nregulatory requirements related to control what goes into production.", "**Everybody gets a build pipeline**": "There\u2019s no cost to configuring many build pipelines, so it\u2019s advantageous to have at least one build\npipeline per microservice. Ideally, microservices are independently deployable to any environment so\nhaving each one able to be released via its own pipeline without releasing a mass of unrelated code is\nperfect. Each pipeline can have its own set of approvals allowing for variations in build process for\neach service.", "**Versioning releases**": "One drawback to using the Releases functionality is that it can\u2019t be defined in a checked-in azurepipelines.yml file. There are many reasons you might want to do that from having per-branch release\ndefinitions to including a release skeleton in your project template. Fortunately, work is ongoing to\nshift some of the stages support into the Build component. This will be known as multi-stage build\n[and the first version is available now!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/whats-new-with-azure-pipelines/)"}, "Feature flags": {"**Implementing feature flags**": "At its core, a feature flag is a reference to a simple decision object. It returns a Boolean state of on or\noff. The flag typically wraps a block of code that encapsulates a feature capability. The state of the flag\ndetermines whether that code block executes for a given user. Figure 10-11 shows the\nimplementation.\n\n_Figure 10-11 - Simple feature flag implementation._\n\nNote how this approach separates the decision logic from the feature code.\n\nIn chapter 1, we discussed the Twelve-Factor App. The guidance recommended keeping configuration\nsettings external from application executable code. When needed, settings can be read in from the\nexternal source. Feature flag configuration values should also be independent from their codebase. By\nexternalizing flag configuration in a separate repository, you can change flag state without modifying\nand redeploying the application.\n\n[Azure App Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides a centralized repository for feature flags. With it, you define\ndifferent kinds of feature flags and manipulate their states quickly and confidently. You add the App\nConfiguration client libraries to your application to enable feature flag functionality. Various\nprogramming language frameworks are supported.\n\n[Feature flags can be easily implemented in an ASP.NET Core service. Installing the .NET Feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/use-feature-flags-dotnet-core)\nManagement libraries and App Configuration provider enable you to declaratively add feature flags to\nyour code. They enable FeatureGate attributes so that you don\u2019t have to manually write if statements\nacross your codebase.\n\nOnce configured in your Startup class, you can add feature flag functionality at the controller, action,\nor middleware level. Figure 10-12 presents controller and action implementation:\n\n_Figure 10-12 - Feature flag implementation in a controller and action._\n\nIf a feature flag is disabled, the user will receive a 404 (Not Found) status code with no response body.\n\nFeature flags can also be injected directly into C# classes. Figure 10-13 shows feature flag injection:\n\n174 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\n_Figure 10-13 - Feature flag injection into a class._\n\nThe Feature Management libraries manage the feature flag lifecycle behind the scenes. For example,\nto minimize high numbers of calls to the configuration store, the libraries cache flag states for a\nspecified duration. They can guarantee the immutability of flag states during a request call. They also\noffer a Point-in-time snapshot. You can reconstruct the history of any key-value and provide its past\nvalue at any moment within the previous seven days."}, "Infrastructure as code": {"**Azure Resource Manager templates**": "[ARM stands for Azure Resource Manager. It\u2019s an API provisioning engine that is built into Azure and](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)\nexposed as an API service. ARM enables you to deploy, update, delete, and manage the resources\ncontained in Azure resource group in a single, coordinated operation. You provide the engine with a\nJSON-based template that specifies the resources you require and their configuration. ARM\nautomatically orchestrates the deployment in the correct order respecting dependencies. The engine\nensures idempotency. If a desired resource already exists with the same configuration, provisioning\nwill be ignored.\n\nAzure Resource Manager templates are a JSON-based language for defining various resources in\nAzure. The basic schema looks something like Figure 10-14.\n\n175 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\n_Figure 10-14 - The schema for a Resource Manager template_\n\nWithin this template, one might define a storage container inside the resources section like so:\n\n_Figure 10-15 - An example of a storage account defined in a Resource Manager template_\n\nAn ARM template can be parameterized with dynamic environment and configuration information.\nDoing so enables it to be reused to define different environments, such as development, QA, or\nproduction. Normally, the template creates all resources within a single Azure resource group. It\u2019s\npossible to define multiple resource groups in a single Resource Manager template, if needed. You\ncan delete all resources in an environment by deleting the resource group itself. Cost analysis can also\nbe run at the resource group level, allowing for quick accounting of how much each environment is\ncosting.\n\n[There are many examples of ARM templates available in the Azure Quickstart Templates project on](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates)\nGitHub. They can help accelerate creating a new template or modifying an existing one.\n\nResource Manager templates can be run in many of ways. Perhaps the simplest way is to simply paste\nthem into the Azure portal. For experimental deployments, this method can be quick. They can also be\nrun as part of a build or release process in Azure DevOps. There are tasks that will leverage\nconnections into Azure to run the templates. Changes to Resource Manager templates are applied\nincrementally, meaning that to add a new resource requires just adding it to the template. The tooling\nwill reconcile differences between the current resources and those defined in the template. Resources\nwill then be created or altered so they match what is defined in the template.", "**Terraform**": "Cloud-native applications are often constructed to be cloud agnostic. Being so means the application\nisn\u2019t tightly coupled to a particular cloud vendor and can be deployed to any public cloud.\n\n176 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\n[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a commercial templating tool that can provision cloud-native applications across all the\nmajor cloud players: Azure, Google Cloud Platform, AWS, and AliCloud. Instead of using JSON as the\ntemplate definition language, it uses the slightly more terse HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language).\n\nAn example Terraform file that does the same as the previous Resource Manager template (Figure 1015) is shown in Figure 10-16:\n\n_Figure 10-16 - An example of a Resource Manager template_\n\nTerraform also provides intuitive error messages for problem templates. There\u2019s also a handy validate\ntask that can be used in the build phase to catch template errors early.\n\nAs with Resource Manager templates, command-line tools are available to deploy Terraform\ntemplates. There are also community-created tasks in Azure Pipelines that can validate and apply\nTerraform templates.\n\nSometimes Terraform and ARM templates output meaningful values, such as a connection string to a\nnewly created database. This information can be captured in the build pipeline and used in\nsubsequent tasks.", "**Azure CLI Scripts and Tasks**": "[Finally, you can leverage Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/) to declaratively script your cloud infrastructure. Azure CLI scripts\ncan be created, found, and shared to provision and configure almost any Azure resource. The CLI is\nsimple to use with a gentle learning curve. Scripts are executed within either PowerShell or Bash.\nThey\u2019re also straightforward to debug, especially when compared with ARM templates.\n\nAzure CLI scripts work well when you need to tear down and redeploy your infrastructure. Updating\nan existing environment can be tricky. Many CLI commands aren\u2019t idempotent. That means they\u2019ll\nrecreate the resource each time they\u2019re run, even if the resource already exists. It\u2019s always possible to\nadd code that checks for the existence of each resource before creating it. But, doing so, your script\ncan become bloated and difficult to manage.\n\nThese scripts can also be embedded in Azure DevOps pipelines as Azure CLI tasks. Executing the\npipeline invokes the script.\n\n177 CHAPTER 10 | DevOps\n\nFigure 10-17 shows a YAML snippet that lists the version of Azure CLI and the details of the\nsubscription.
