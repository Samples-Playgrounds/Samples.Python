      <td>Implicit</td>
      <td>This flow is optimized for browser-based applications and should be used either for user authentication-only, or authentication and access token requests. All tokens are transmitted via the browser, and therefore advanced features like refresh tokens are not permitted.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Authorization code</td>
      <td>This flow provides the ability to retrieve tokens on a back channel, as opposed to the browser front channel, while also supporting client authentication.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Hybrid</td>
      <td>This flow is a combination of the implicit and authorization code grant types. The identity token is transmitted via the browser channel and contains the signed protocol response and other artifacts such as the authorization code. After successfully validating the response, the back channel should be used to retrieve the access and refresh token.</td>
