|  0 | Implicit           |                       | This flow is optimized for browser-based          |
|  1 |                    |                       | applications and should be used either for user   |
|  2 |                    |                       | authentication-only, or authentication and        |
|  3 |                    |                       | access token requests. All tokens are             |
|  4 |                    |                       | transmitted via the browser, and therefore        |
|  5 |                    |                       | advanced features like refresh tokens are not     |
|  6 |                    |                       | permitted.                                        |
|  7 | Authorization code |                       | This flow provides the ability to retrieve tokens |
|  8 |                    |                       | on a back channel, as opposed to the browser      |
|  9 |                    |                       | front channel, while also supporting client       |
| 10 |                    |                       | authentication.                                   |
| 11 | Hybrid             |                       | This flow is a combination of the implicit and    |
| 12 |                    |                       | authorization code grant types. The identity      |
| 13 |                    |                       | token is transmitted via the browser channel      |
| 14 |                    |                       | and contains the signed protocol response and     |
| 15 |                    |                       | other artifacts such as the authorization code.   |
| 16 |                    |                       | After successfully validating the response, the   |
| 17 |                    |                       | back channel should be used to retrieve the       |
| 18 |                    |                       | access and refresh token.                         |
