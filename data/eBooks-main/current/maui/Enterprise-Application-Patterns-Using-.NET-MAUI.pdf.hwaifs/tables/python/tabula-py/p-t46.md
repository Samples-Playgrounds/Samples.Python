|  0 | Property validation can sometimes involve dependent properties. An example of dependent                 |
|  1 | properties is when the set of valid values for property A depends on the particular value that has been |
|  2 | set in property B. To check that the value of property A is one of the allowed values would involve     |
|  3 | retrieving the value of property B. In addition, when the value of property B changes, property A       |
|  4 | would need to be revalidated.                                                                           |
