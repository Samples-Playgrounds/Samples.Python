      <td>This flow is a combination of the implicit and\nauthorization code grant types. The identity\ntoken is transmitted via the browser channel\nand contains the signed protocol response and\nother artifacts such as the authorization code.\nAfter successfully validating the response, the\nback channel should be used to retrieve the\naccess and refresh token.</td>
