      <td>Containers are deployed from images. The container operating system image is the first layer in potentially many image layers that make up a container. A container operating system is immutable, and can't be modified.</td>

      <td>Container Repository</td>
      <td>Each time a container image is created, the image and its dependencies are stored in a local repository. These images can be reused many times on the container host. The container images can also be stored in a public or private registry, such as Docker Hub, so that they can be used across different container hosts.</td>
