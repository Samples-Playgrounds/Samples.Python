|  0 | While the IMessenger interface permits communication between loosely-coupled classes, it does not    |
|  1 | offer the only architectural solution to this issue. For example, communication between a view model |
|  2 | and a view can also be achieved by the binding engine and through property change notifications. In  |
|  3 | addition, communication between two view models can also be achieved by passing data during          |
|  4 | navigation.                                                                                          |
