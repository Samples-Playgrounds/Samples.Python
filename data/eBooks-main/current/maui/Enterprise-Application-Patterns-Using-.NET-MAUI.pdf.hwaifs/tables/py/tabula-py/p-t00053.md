|  0 | Container Host  | The physical or virtual machine configured to    |
|    |                 | host containers. The container host will run one |
|    |                 | or more containers.                              |
|  1 | Container Image | An image consists of a union of layered          |
|    |                 | filesystems stacked on top of each other, and is |
|    |                 | the basis of a container. An image does not      |
|    |                 | have state and it never changes as it’s deployed |
|    |                 | to different environments.                       |
|  2 | Container       | A container is a runtime instance of an image.   |
