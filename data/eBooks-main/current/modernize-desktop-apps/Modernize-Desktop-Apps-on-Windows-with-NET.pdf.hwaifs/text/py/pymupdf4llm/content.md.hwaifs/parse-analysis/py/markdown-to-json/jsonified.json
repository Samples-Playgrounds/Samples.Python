{"1": {"Why modern desktop applications": {"Introduction": {"**A story of one company**": "Back in the early 2000s, one multinational company started developing a distributed desktop solution\nto exchange information between different branches of the company and execute optimized\noperations on centralized units. They have chosen a brand-new framework called Windows Forms\n(also known as WinForms) for their application development. Over the years, the project evolved into\na mature, well-tested, and time-proven application with hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Time\npassed and .NET Framework 2.0 is no longer the hot new technology. The developers who are\nworking on this application are facing a dilemma. They\u2019d like to use the latest stack of technologies in\ntheir development and have their application look and \u201cfeel\u201d modern. At the same time, they don\u2019t\nwant to throw away the great product they have built over 15 years and rewrite the entire application\nfrom scratch.", "**Your story**": "You might find yourself in the same boat, where you have mature Windows Forms or Windows\nPresentation Foundation (WPF) applications that have proved their reliability over the years. You\nprobably want to keep using these applications for many more years. At the same time, since those\napplications were written some time ago, they might be missing capabilities like modern look,\nperformance, integration with new devices and platform features, and so on, which gives them a feel\nof \u201cold tech\u201d. There\u2019s another problem that might concern you as a developer. While working on the\nolder .NET Framework versions and maintaining applications that were written a while ago, you might\nfeel like you aren\u2019t learning new technologies and missing out on building modern technical skills. If\nthat is your story \u2013 this book is for you!"}, "Desktop applications nowadays": {"**Windows Forms**": "First released in 2002, Windows Forms is a managed framework and is the oldest, most-used desktop\ntechnology built on the Windows graphics device interface (GDI) engine. It offers a smooth drag-anddrop experience for developing user interfaces in Visual Studio. At the same time, Windows Forms\nrelies on the Visual Studio Designer as the main way you develop your UI, so creating visual\ncomponents from code isn\u2019t trivial.\n\nThe following list summarizes the main characteristics of Windows Forms:\n\n['Mature technology with lots of code samples and documentation.', 'Powerful and productive designer. Not so convenient to design UI \u201cfrom code\u201d.', 'Easy and intuitive to learn, thanks to the designer\u2019s drag-and-drop experience.', 'Supported on any Windows version.', 'Supported on .NET Core 3.0 and later versions.']\n\n3 CHAPTER 1 | Why modern desktop applications", "**WPF**": "Based on the XAML language specification, WPF favors a clear separation between UI and code. XAML\noffers capabilities like templating, styling, and binding, which is suited for building large applications.\nLike Windows Forms, it\u2019s a managed framework, but the design is modular and reusable.\n\nHere are the main features of WPF:\n\n['Mature technology.', 'Designer is available, but developers usually prefer to create the design from code using\\ndeclarative XAML.', 'The learning curve is steeper than Windows Forms.', 'Supported on any Windows version.', 'Supported on .NET Core 3.0 and later versions.']", "**UWP**": "UWP isn\u2019t only a presentation framework like WPF and Windows Forms, but it\u2019s also a platform itself.\nThis platform has:\n\n['Its own API set (the Windows Runtime API).', 'A new deployment system (MSIX)', 'A modern application lifecycle model (for low battery consumption).', 'A new Resource Management System (based on PRI files).']\n\nThe platform was created to support all kinds of input systems (like ink, touch, gamepad, mouse,\nkeyboard, gaze, and so on) in all form-factors with performance and low battery consumption in mind.\nFor these reasons, the shell of the Windows 10 OS uses parts of the UWP platform.\n\n4 CHAPTER 1 | Why modern desktop applications\n\nUWP contains a presentation framework that is XAML-based, like WPF, but it has some important\ndifferences such as:\n\n['Applications are executed in app containers. App containers control what resources a UWP\\napp can access.', 'Supported only on Windows 10 and Windows 11.', 'Apps can be deployed through Microsoft Store for easier deployment.', 'Designed as part of the Windows Runtime API.', 'Contains an extensive set of rich built-in controls and additional controls are available\\nthrough the Microsoft UI Library NuGet packages (WinUI library), updated every few months.']"}, "A tale of two platforms": "In the last 20 years, while UI desktop technologies were growing and following the path from\nWindows Forms to UWP, the hardware was also evolving from heavyweight PC units with small CRT\nmonitors to high-DPI monitors and lightweight tablets and phones with different data input\ntechniques like Touch and Ink. These changes resulted in creating two different concepts: a Desktop\nApplication and a Modern Application. A Modern Application is one that considers different device\nform factors, various input and output methods, and leverages modern desktop features while\nrunning on a sandboxed execution model. The (traditional) Desktop Application, on the other hand, is\n\n5 CHAPTER 1 | Why modern desktop applications\n\nan application that needs a solid UI with a high density of controls that is best operated with a mouse\nand a keyboard.\n\nThe following table describes the differences between the two concepts:\n\n|Aspect of comparison|Modern Application|Desktop Application|\n|---|---|---|\n|Security|Contained execution & Great<br>Fundamentals. Designed from<br>the ground up to respect user\u2019s<br>privacy, manage battery life,<br>and focus to keep the device<br>safe.|User & Admin level of security.<br>You have native access to the<br>registry and hard drive folders.|\n|Deployment|Installation and updates are<br>managed by the platform.|MSI, Custom installers &<br>Updates. Traditionally a source<br>of headaches for developers<br>and IT managers.|\n|Distribution|Trusted Distribution & Signed<br>Packages. Distribution is<br>performed from a trusted<br>source and never from the<br>web.|Web, SCCM & Custom<br>distribution. No control over<br>what is installed, affects the<br>whole machine.|\n|UI|Modern UI.

Reuse in<br>mind between different<br>platforms, front end, and back<br>end, running assets in many<br>places as possible.|Designed for Windows<br>Desktop only|\n\nAs a part of the commitment to provide developers with the best tools to build applications, Microsoft\nput forth a great effort to bring these concepts - or we can even say platforms - closer together to\nempower developers with the best of both worlds. To do that, Microsoft has performed a bidirectional\neffort between the two platforms.\n\n6 CHAPTER 1 | Why modern desktop applications\n\n['Move Desktop Application scenarios into Modern Application platform. The traditional\\ndesktop development is still popular because it addresses certain scenarios well. It makes\\nsense to take these common desktop scenarios and bring them into the modern desktop\\nplatform to make the platform fully capable.']\n\n['Move Modern Application features into Desktop Applications. For existing desktop apps that\\nneed a way to leverage modern capabilities without rewriting from scratch, features from the\\nModern Application platform are pushed into the Desktop Application.']\n\n7 CHAPTER 1 | Why modern desktop applications\n\nIn this book, we\u2019ll focus on the second part and show how you can modernize your existing desktop\napplications.", "Paths to modernization": {"**Modern features**": "Say you have a working Windows Forms application that a sales representative of your company uses\nto fill in a customer order. A new requirement comes in to enable the customer to sign the order\nusing a tablet pen. Inking is native in today\u2019s operating systems and technologies, but it wasn\u2019t\navailable when the app was developed.\n\nThis path will show you how you can leverage modern desktop features into your existing desktop\ndevelopment.", "**Deployment**": "Modern development cycles have stressed the importance of providing agility with regard to how new\nversions of applications are deployed to individual users. Since Windows Forms and WPF applications\nare based on a particular version of the .NET Framework that must be present on the machine, they\ncan\u2019t take advantage of new .NET Framework version features without the intervention of the IT\npeople with the risk of having side effects for other apps running on the same machine. It has limited\nthe innovation pace for developers forcing them to stay on outdated versions of the .NET Framework.\n\nSince the launch of .NET Core 3.0, you can leverage a new approach of deploying multiple versions of\n.NET side by side and specifying which version of .NET each application should target. This way, you\ncan use the newest features in one application while being confident you aren\u2019t going to break any\nother applications.", "**Installation**": "Desktop applications always rely on some sort of installation process before the user can start using\nthem. This fact brought into the game a set of technologies, from MSI and ClickOnce to custom\ninstallers or even XCOPY deployment. Any of these methods deals with delicate problems because\napplications need a way to access shared resources on the machine. Sometimes installation needs to\naccess the Registry to insert or update new Key Values, sometimes to update shared DLLs referenced\nby the main application. This behavior causes a continuous headache for users, creating this\nperception that once you install some application, your computer will never be the same, even if you\nuninstall it afterwards.\n\nIn this book, we\u2019ll introduce a new way of installing applications with MSIX that solves the problem\ndescribed earlier. You\u2019ll learn how you can easily set up packaging, installation, and updates for your\napplication.\n\n8 CHAPTER 1 | Why modern desktop applications\n\n**CHAPTER**"}}}, "2": {"What\u2019s new with .NET for Desktop?": {"The motivation behind .NET Core": "Since its launch in 2002, .NET Framework has evolved to support many technologies, like Windows\nForms, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, Windows Store, and many others. All of them are different in\nnature. Therefore, Microsoft approached this evolution by taking parts of .NET Framework and\ncreating a different application stack for each technology. That way, development capabilities could\nbe customized for the needs of the specific stack, which maximized the potential of every platform.\nThat led to fragmentation on the versions of .NET Framework maintained by different independent\nteams. All of these stacks have a common structure, containing an app model, a framework, and a\nruntime, but they differ in the implementation of each of the parts.\n\nIf you\u2019re targeting only one of these platforms, you can use this model. However, in many cases you\nmight need more than one target platform in the same solution. For example, your application may\nhave a desktop admin part, a customer-facing web site that shares the back-end logic running on a\nserver, and even a mobile client. In this case, you need a unified coding experience that can span all of\nthese .NET verticals.\n\nBy the time Windows 8 was released, the concept of Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) was born.\nOriginally, .NET Framework was designed around the assumption that it would always be deployed as\n[a single unit, so factoring wasn\u2019t a concern. To face the problem of code sharing between verticals, the](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science))\ndriving force was on how to refactor the framework. The idea of contracts is to provide a well-factored\n\n9 CHAPTER 2 | What\u2019s new with .NET for Desktop?\n\nAPI surface area. Contracts are simply assemblies that you compile against and are designed with\nproper factoring in mind taking care of the dependencies between them.\n\nThis led to reasoning about the API differences between verticals at the assembly level, as opposed to\nat the individual API level like previously. This aspect enabled a class library experience that can target\nmultiple verticals, also known as portable class libraries.\n\nWith PCL, the experience of development is unified across verticals based on the API shape. And the\nmost pressing need to create libraries running on different verticals is also addressed. But there\u2019s a\ngreat challenge: APIs are only portable when the implementation is moved forward across all the\nverticals.\n\nA better approach is to unify the implementations across verticals by providing a well-factored\nimplementation instead of a well-factored view. It\u2019s a lot simpler to ask each team that owns a specific\ncomponent to think about how their APIs work across all verticals than trying to retroactively provide\na consistent API stack on top. This is where .NET Standard comes in.\n\nAnother large challenge has to do with how .NET Framework is deployed. .NET Framework is a\nmachine-wide framework. Any changes made to it affect all applications that take a dependency on it.\nAlthough this deployment model has many advantages, such as reducing disk space and centralized\naccess to services, it presents some pitfalls.\n\nTo start with, it\u2019s difficult for application developers to take a dependency on a recently released\nframework. They either have to take a dependency on the latest OS or provide an application installer\nthat installs .NET Framework along with the application. If you\u2019re a web developer, you might not even\nhave this option as the IT department establishes the server supported version.\n\nEven if you\u2019re willing to go through the trouble of providing an installer to chain in .NET Framework\nsetup, you may find that upgrading .NET Framework can break other applications.\n\nDespite the efforts to provide backward compatible versions of the framework, there are compatible\nchanges that can break applications. For example, adding an interface to an existing type can change\nhow this type is serialized and cause breaking problems depending on the existing code. Because the\n.NET Framework installed base is huge, fighting against these breaking scenarios slows down the pace\nof innovations inside .NET Framework.\n\nTo solve all these issues, Microsoft developed .NET Core as the evolution of the .NET development\nplatform.\n\n10 CHAPTER 2 | What\u2019s new with .NET for Desktop?", "Introduction to .NET Core": ".NET Core, which is now referred to as just \u201c.NET\u201d, is the evolution of Microsoft\u2019s .NET technology into\na modular, cross-platform, open source, and cloud-ready platform. It runs on Windows, macOS, and\nLinux, and some ARM-based architectures like Android and IoT.\n\nThe purpose of .NET Core is to provide a unified platform for all types of applications, which includes\n[Windows, cross-platform, and mobile applications. .NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/net-standard) enabled this by providing shared\nbase APIs, which every application model needs, and excluding any application model-specific API.\n\nThis framework gives applications many benefits in terms of efficiency and performance, simplifying\nthe packaging and deployment in the different supported platforms.\n\nThe benefits of .NET Core come from these three characteristics:\n\n['**Cross-platform:** It allows application execution on different platforms (Windows, macOS, and\\nLinux).', '**Open source:** .NET Core platform is open source and available through GitHub, fostering\\ntransparency and community contributions.', '**Supported:** Microsoft officially supports .NET Core.']\n\nStarting with .NET Core 3.0, besides the existing support for web and cloud, there\u2019s also support for\ndesktop, IoT, and AI domains. The goal for this framework is impressive: to target every type of .NET\ndevelopment present and future.", ".NET 5+ is .NET Core vNext": ".NET 5 was the next step forward with .NET Core. .NET 5 improved .NET in a few key ways:\n\n['Produced a single .NET runtime and framework that can be used everywhere and that has\\nuniform runtime behaviors and developer experiences.', 'Expanded the capabilities of .NET by taking the best of .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin,\\nand Mono.', 'Built that product out of a single code-base that developers (Microsoft and the community)\\ncan work on and expand together and that improves all scenarios.']\n\n.NET 5 was a game-changer for .NET. With .NET 5 and later versions, your code and project files look\nand feel the same no matter which type of app you\u2019re building. You have access to the same runtime,\nAPIs, and language capabilities with each app. This includes new performance improvements that get\ncommitted to the runtime almost daily. .NET 6 and .NET 7 made further improvements in reliability,\n[performance, new APIs, and language features. For more details, see What\u2019s new in .NET 5, What\u2019s](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-5)\n[new in .NET 6, and What\u2019s new in .NET 7.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6)\n\n11 CHAPTER 2 | What\u2019s new with .NET for Desktop?", ".NET Framework vs. .NET": "So now that you understand the relevance of .NET, you might be wondering what happens with .NET\nFramework. You could be asking questions like: Do I have to abandon it? Is it going to disappear?\nWhat are my choices to modernize the applications I have on .NET Framework?\n\nIn 2019, .NET Framework 4.8 was released. It included three major improvements for desktop\napplications:\n\n['**Modern browser and media controls** : New controls were added that take advantage of\\nMicrosoft Edge and newer media players that support the latest standards.', '**Access to UWP controls** : UWP introduced controls that take advantage of the latest\\nWindows features and touch displays. With .NET Framework 4.8, you don\u2019t have to rewrite\\nyour applications to use these new features and controls, so you can use these new features\\nin your existing WPF or Windows Forms code.', '**High-DPI improvements** : The resolution of displays increased to 4K and 8K, so, .NET\\nFramework 4.8 added new HDPI improvements to make sure existing Windows Forms and\\nWPF applications can look great on these new displays.']\n\nSince .NET Framework is installed on millions of machines, Microsoft will continue to support it but\nwon\u2019t add new features.\n\n.NET (Core) is the open-source, cross-platform, and fast-moving version of the .NET family. Because of\nits side-by-side nature, it can take changes without the fear of breaking any application. This means\nthat .NET will get new APIs and language features over time that .NET Framework won\u2019t. Also, .NET\nalready has features that were impossible for .NET Framework, such as:\n\n['**Side-by-side versions of .NET supporting Windows Forms and WPF** : This solves the\\nproblem of side effects when updating the machine\u2019s framework version. Multiple versions of\\n.NET can be installed on the same machine and each application specifies which version of']\n\n12 CHAPTER 2 | What\u2019s new with .NET for Desktop?\n\n.NET it should use. Even more, now you can develop and run Windows Forms and WPF on top\nof .NET.\n\n['**Embed .NET directly into an application** : You can deploy .NET as part of your application\\npackage.

However, if you want to\nuse the newest language features and APIs in the future, you\u2019ll need to move your applications to\n.NET.

Most of the top-level APIs\nremain the same, so EF Core will feel familiar to developers who have used EF6.\n\nAlthough compatible, there are differences on the implementation you should check before making a\n[decision. For more information, see Compare EF Core & EF6.](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/efcore-and-ef6/)\n\nThe recommendation is to use EF Core if:\n\n['The app needs the capabilities of .NET.', 'EF Core supports all of the features that the app requires.']\n\nConsider using EF6 if both of the following conditions are true:\n\n['The app will run on Windows and .NET Framework 4.0 or later.', 'EF6 supports all of the features that the app requires.']\n\n19 CHAPTER 3 | Migrating Modern Desktop applications", "**Relational databases**": "**SQL Server**\n\nSQL Server has been one of the databases of choice if you were developing for the desktop some\n[years ago.

In the client-server approach, a direct database connection\nis established from the client holding the business logic, usually inside a single EXE file. On the other\nhand, the three-layer approach establishes an intermediate service layer implementing business logic\nand database access, allowing for better security, scalability, and reusability. Instead of working\ndirectly with underlying data, the layered approach relies on a set of services implementing contracts\nand typed objects for data transfer.\n\nIf you have a desktop application using a WCF service and you want to migrate it to .NET, there are\nsome things to consider.\n\nThe first thing is how to resolve the configuration to access the service. Because the configuration is\ndifferent on .NET, you\u2019ll need to make some updates in your configuration file.\n\nSecond, you\u2019ll need to regenerate the service client with the new tools present on Visual Studio 2019\nand Visual Studio 2022.

That requires the installation to be declarative, meaning that no user code is executed\nduring install. Instead, everything the app wants to integrate with the system, such as protocols, file\ntypes, and extensions, is declared in the application manifest. At deployment time, the deployment\npipeline configures those integration points. The only way for the OS to manage all this functionality\nand keep track of it is for each \u2018package\u2019 to have an identity, a unique identifier for the application.\n\nSome WinRT APIs require this package identity to work as expected. However, classic desktop apps\nlike native C++ or .NET apps, use different deployment systems that don\u2019t require a package identity.\nIf you want to use these WinRT APIs in your desktop application, you need to provide them a package\nidentity.\n\nOne way to proceed is to build an additional packaging project. Inside the packaging project, you\npoint to the original source code project and specify the Identity information you want to provide. If\nyou install the package and run the installed app, it will automatically get an identify enabling your\ncode to call all WinRT APIs requiring Identity.\n\nYou can check which APIs need a packaged application identity by inspecting if the type that contains\n[the API is marked with the DualApiPartition](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.foundation.metadata.dualapipartitionattribute) attribute. If it is, you can call if from an unpackaged\ntraditional desktop app. Otherwise, you must convert your classic desktop app to a UWP with the help\nof a packaging project.\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/apiindex/uwp-apis-callable-from-a-classic-desktop-app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/apiindex/uwp-apis-callable-from-a-classic-desktop-app)\n\n**Benefits of packaging**\n\nBesides giving you access to these APIs, you get some additional benefits by creating a Windows App\npackage for your desktop application including:\n\n['**Streamlined deployment** . Apps have a great deployment experience ensuring that users can\\nconfidently install an application and update it. If a user chooses to uninstall the app, it\u2019s\\nremoved completely with no trace left behind preventing the Windows rot problem.']\n\n['**Automatic updates and licensing** . Your application can participate in the Microsoft Store\u2019s\\nbuilt-in licensing and automatic update facilities. Automatic update is a highly reliable and\\nefficient mechanism, because only the changed parts of files are downloaded.']\n\n24 CHAPTER 4 | Windows 10 migration\n\n['**Increased reach and simplified monetization** . Maybe not your case but if you choose to\\ndistribute your application through the Microsoft Store you reach millions of Windows 10 and\\nWindows 11 users.']\n\n['**Add UWP features** . You can add UWP features to your app\u2019s package at your own pace.']\n\n**Prepare for packaging**\n\nBefore proceeding to package your desktop application, there are some points you have to address\nbefore starting the process. Your application must respect any of the Microsoft Store rules and\npolicies and run in the UWP application model. For example, it has to run on the .NET Framework 4.6.2\nor later and writes to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive and the AppData folders will be\nvirtualized to a user-specific app-local location.\n\nThe design goal for packaging is to separate the application state from system state while maintaining\ncompatibility with other apps. Windows 10 and Windows 11 accomplish this goal by placing the\napplication inside a UWP package. It detects and redirects some changes to the file system and\nregistry at run time to fulfill the promise of a trusted and clean install and uninstall behavior of an\napplication provided by packaging.\n\nPackages that you create for your desktop application are desktop-only, full-trust applications that\naren\u2019t sandboxed, although there\u2019s lightweight virtualization applied to the app for writes to HKCU\nand AppData. This virtualization allows them to interact with other apps the same way classic desktop\napplications do.\n\n**Installation**\n\nApp packages are installed under _%ProgramFiles%\\WindowsApps\\package_name_, with the executable\ntitled app_name.exe. Each package folder contains a manifest (named AppxManifest.xml) that contains\na special XML namespace for packaged apps. Inside that manifest file is an <EntryPoint> element,\nwhich references the full-trust app. When that application is launched, it doesn\u2019t run inside an app\ncontainer, but instead it runs as the user as it normally would.\n\nAfter deployment, package files are marked read-only and heavily locked down by the operating\nsystem. Windows prevents apps from launching if these files are tampered with.\n\n**File system**\n\nThe OS supports different levels of file system operations for packaged desktop applications,\ndepending on the folder location.\n\nWhen trying to access the user\u2019s _AppData_ folder, the system creates a private per-user, per-app\nlocation behind the scenes. This creates the illusion that the packaged application is editing the real\n_AppData_ when it\u2019s actually modifying a private copy. By redirecting writes this way, the system can\ntrack all file modifications made by the app. It can then clean all those files when uninstalling reducing\nsystem \u201crot\u201d and providing a better application removal experience for the user.\n\n25 CHAPTER 4 | Windows 10 migration\n\n**Registry**\n\nApp packages contain a registry.dat file, which serves as the logical equivalent of HKLM\\Software in\nthe real registry. At run time, this virtual registry merges the contents of this hive into the native\nsystem hive to provide a singular view of both.\n\nAll writes are kept during package upgrade and only deleted when the application is uninstalled.\n\n**Uninstallation**\n\nWhen the user uninstalls a package, all files and folders located under C:\\Program\nFiles\\WindowsApps\\package_name are removed, as well as any redirected writes to AppData or the\nregistry that were captured during the process.\n\nFor details about how a packaged application handles installation, file access, registry, and\n[uninstallation, see https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes)\n[scenes.](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes)\n\nYou can get a complete list of things to check on\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-prepare.](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-prepare)"}, "How to add WinRT APIs to your desktop project": "In this section, you can find a walkthrough on how to integrate Toast Notifications in an existing WPF\napplication.

However, the new UI\ncontrols inside WinRT were available for new applications but not for existing ones.\n\nIn 2015, along with Windows 10, UWP was born. UWP allows you to create apps that work across\nWindows devices like XBox, Mobile, and Desktop. One year later, Microsoft announced Desktop\nBridge (formerly known as Project Centennial). Desktop Bridge is a set of tools that allowed\ndevelopers to bring their existing Win32 apps to the Microsoft Store. More capabilities were added in\n2017, allowing developers to enhance their Win32 apps leveraging some of the new Windows 10 APIs,\nlike live tiles and notifications on the action center. But still, no new UI controls.\n\nAt Build 2018, Microsoft announced a way for developers to use the new Windows 10 XAML controls\ninto their current Win32 apps, without fully migrating their apps to UWP. It was branded as UWP\nXAML Islands.", "**How it works**": "The Windows 10 1903 update introduced several XAML hosting APIs. Two of them are\nWindowsXamlManager and DesktopWindowXamlSource.\n\n35 CHAPTER 4 | Windows 10 migration\n\nThe WindowsXamlManager class handles the UWP XAML Framework. Its InitializeForCurrentThread\nmethod loads the UWP XAML Framework inside the current thread of the Win32 app.\n\nThe DesktopWindowXamlSource is the instance of your XAML Island content. It has the Content\nproperty, which you\u2019re responsible for instantiating and setting. The DesktopWindowXamlSource\nrenders and gets its input from an HWND. It needs to know to which other HWND it will attach the\nXAML Island\u2019s one, and you\u2019re responsible for sizing and positioning the parent\u2019s HWND.\n\nWPF or Windows Forms developers don\u2019t usually deal with HWND inside their code, so it may be hard\nto understand and handle HWND pointers and the underlying wiring stuff to communicate Win32 and\nUWP worlds.\n\n**The XAML Islands .NET Wrappers**\n\nThe Windows Community Toolkit has a set the XAML Islands .NET wrappers for WPF or Windows\nForms that make easier to use XAML Islands. These wrappers manage the HWNDs, the focus\nmanagement, among other things. Windows Forms and WPF developers should use these wrappers.\n\nThe Windows Community Toolkit offers two types of controls: Wrapped Controls and Hosting\nControls.\n\n**Wrapped Controls**\n\nThese wrapped controls wrap some UWP controls into Windows Forms or WPF controls, hiding UWP\nconcepts for those developers. These controls are:\n\n['WebView and WebViewCompatible', 'InkCanvas and InkToolbar', 'MediaPlayerElement', 'MapControl']\n\nAdd the Microsoft.Toolkit.Wpf.UI.Controls package to your project, include the reference to the\nnamespace, and start using them.\n\n**Hosting controls**\n\nThe power of XAML Islands extends to most first-party controls, third-party controls, and custom\ncontrols developed for UWP, which can be integrated into Windows Forms and WPF as \u201cIslands\u201d with\nfully functional UI. The WindowsXamlHost control for WPF and Windows Forms allows doing this.\n\n36 CHAPTER 4 | Windows 10 migration\n\nFor example, to use the WindowsXamlHost control in WPF, add a reference to the\nMicrosoft.Toolkit.Wpf.UI.XamlHost package provided by the Windows Community Toolkit.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve placed your WindowsXamlHost into your UI code, specify which UWP type you want to\nload. You can choose to use a wrapped control like a Button or a more complex one composed of\nseveral different controls, which are a custom UWP control.\n\nThe following example shows how to add a UWP Button:\n\nThere\u2019s a clear recommendation on how to approach this and it\u2019s better to have one single and bigger\nXAML Island containing a custom composite control than to have several islands with one control on\neach.\n\nOne of the core features of XAML is binding and it works between your Win32 code and the island.\nSo, you can bind, for instance, a Win32 Textbox with a UWP Textbox. One important thing to consider\nis that these bindings are one-way bindings, from UWP to Win32, so if you update the Textbox inside\nthe XAML Island the Win32 Textbox will be updated, but not the other way around.\n\nTo see a walkthrough about how to use XAML Islands, see:\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-standard-control-with-xaml-](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-standard-control-with-xaml-islands)\n[islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-standard-control-with-xaml-islands)\n\n**Adding UWP XAML custom controls**\n\nA XAML custom control is a control (or user control) created by you or by third parties (including\nWinUI 2.x controls). To host a custom UWP control in a Windows Forms or WPF app, you\u2019ll need:\n\n['To use the WindowsXamlHost UWP control in your .NET app.', 'To create a UWP app project that defines a XamlApplication object.']\n\nYour WPF or Windows Forms project must have access to an instance of the\nMicrosoft.Toolkit.Win32.UI.XamlHost.XamlApplication class provided by the Windows Community\nToolkit. This object acts as a root metadata provider for loading metadata for custom UWP XAML\ntypes in assemblies in the current directory of your application. The recommended way to do this is to\nadd a Blank App (Universal Windows) project to the same solution as your WPF or Windows Forms\nproject and revise the default App class in this project.\n\nThe custom UWP XAML control can be included on this UWP app or in an independent UWP Class\nLibrary project that you reference in the same solution as your WPF or Windows Forms project.\n\nYou can check a detailed step-by-step process description at:\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-custom-control-with-xaml-](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-custom-control-with-xaml-islands)\n[islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-custom-control-with-xaml-islands)\n\n37 CHAPTER 4 | Windows 10 migration\n\n**The Windows UI Library (WinUI 2)**\n\nBesides the inbox Windows 10 controls that comes with the OS, the same UWP XAML team also\ndelivers additional controls in the Windows UI Library ( **WinUI 2** ).

To decouple these two\nevolution cycles and foster innovation, Microsoft is actively working on the WinUI project.\n\nStarting with WinUI 2 in 2018, Microsoft started shipping some new XAML UI controls and features as\nseparate NuGet packages that build on top of the UWP SDK.\n\n38 CHAPTER 4 | Windows 10 migration\n\nWinUI 3 is under active development and will greatly expand the scope of WinUI to include the full UI\nplatform, which will be fully decoupled from the UWP SDK:\n\n[XAML framework will now be developed on GitHub and shipped out of band as NuGet packages.](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/what-is-nuget)\n\nThe existing UWP XAML APIs that ship as part of the OS will no longer receive new feature updates.\nThey will still receive security updates and critical fixes according to the Windows 10 support lifecycle.\n\nThe Universal Windows Platform contains more than just the XAML framework (for example,\napplication and security model, media pipeline, Xbox and Windows 10 shell integrations, broad device\nsupport) and will continue to evolve.

Or, you can let Visual Studio do the work for you: right-click on the\n_packages.config_ file and select the **Migrate packages.config to PackageReference** option.\n\n**Verify every dependency compatibility in .NET**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve migrated the package references, you must check each reference for compatibility. You\n[can explore the dependencies of each NuGet package your application is using on nuget.org. If the](https://www.nuget.org/)\n[package has .NET Standard dependencies, then it\u2019s going to work on .NET 7 because .NET supports](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support) all\nversions of .NET Standard. The following image shows the dependencies for the Castle.Windsor\npackage:\n\n[To check the package compatibility, you can use the tool https://fuget.org](https://fuget.org/) that offers a more detailed\ninformation about versions and dependencies.\n\nMaybe the project is referencing older package versions that don\u2019t support .NET, but you might find\nnewer versions that do support it. So, updating packages to newer versions is generally a good\n\n43 CHAPTER 5 | Example of migrating to the latest .NET\n\nrecommendation. However, you should consider that updating the package version can introduce\nsome breaking changes that would force you to update your code.\n\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t find a compatible version? What if you just don\u2019t want to update the\nversion of a package because of these breaking changes? Don\u2019t worry because it\u2019s possible to depend\non .NET Framework packages from a .NET application. Don\u2019t forget to test it extensively because it can\ncause run-time errors if the external package calls an API that isn\u2019t available on .NET. This is great for\nwhen you\u2019re using an old package that isn\u2019t going to be updated and you can just retarget to work on\n.NET.\n\n**Check for API compatibility**\n\nSince the API surface in .NET Framework and .NET is similar but not identical, you must check which\nAPIs are available on .NET and which aren\u2019t. You can use the .NET Portability Analyzer tool to surface\nAPIs used that aren\u2019t present on .NET. It looks at the binary level of your app, extracts all the APIs that\nare called, and then lists which APIs aren\u2019t available on your target framework (.NET 7 in this case).\n\nYou can find more information about this tool at:\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/analyzers/portability-analyzer](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/analyzers/portability-analyzer)\n\nAn interesting aspect of this tool is that it only surfaces the differences from your own code and not\ncode from external packages, which you can\u2019t change. Remember you should have updated most of\nthese packages to make them work with .NET.\n\n**Migrate**\n\n['Create the new .NET project']\n\nIn most cases, you\u2019ll want to update your existing project to the new .NET format. However, you can\nalso create a new project while maintaining the old one. The main drawback from updating the old\nproject is that you lose designer support, which may be important to you and your development\nteam. If you want to keep using the designer, you must create a new .NET project in parallel with the\nold one and share assets. If you need to modify UI elements in the designer, you can switch to the old\nproject to do that. And since assets are linked, they\u2019ll be updated in the .NET project as well.\n\n[The SDK-style project](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props) for .NET is a lot simpler than .NET Framework\u2019s project format. Apart from the\npreviously mentioned PackageReference entries, you won\u2019t need to do much more. The new project\n[format includes files with certain extensions by default, such as .cs and .xaml files, without the need to](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview#default-includes-and-excludes)\nexplicitly include them in the project file.\n\n**AssemblyInfo considerations**\n\nAttributes are autogenerated on .NET projects. If the project contains an _AssemblyInfo.cs_ file, the\ndefinitions will be duplicated, which will cause compilation conflicts. You can delete the older\n_AssemblyInfo.cs_ file or disable autogeneration by adding the following entry to the .NET project file:\n\n44 CHAPTER 5 | Example of migrating to the latest .NET\n\n**Resources**\n\nEmbedded resources are included automatically but resources aren\u2019t, so you need to migrate the\nresources to the new project file.\n\n**Package references**\n\nWith the **Migrate packages.config to PackageReference** option, you can easily move your external\npackage references to the new format as previously mentioned.\n\n**Update package references**\n\nUpdate the versions of the packages you\u2019ve found to be compatible, as shown in the previous section.", "**Fix the code and build**": "**Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility**\n\nIf your application depends on APIs that aren\u2019t available on .NET, such as Registry or ACLs, you have\nto include a reference to the Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility package to add these Windowsspecific APIs. They work on .NET but aren\u2019t included as they aren\u2019t cross-platform.\n\nThere\u2019s a tool called Platform compatibility analyzer\n[(https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/analyzers/platform-compat-analyzer) that helps you](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/analyzers/platform-compat-analyzer)\nidentify APIs that aren\u2019t compatible with your code.\n\n**Use #if directives**\n\nIf you need different execution paths when targeting .NET Framework and .NET, you should use\ncompilation constants. Add some #if directives to your code to keep the same codebase for both\ntargets.\n\n**Technologies not available on .NET**\n\nSome technologies aren\u2019t available on .NET, such as:\n\n['AppDomains', 'Remoting', 'Code Access Security', 'Windows Workflow']\n\nThat\u2019s why you need to find a replacement for these technologies if you\u2019re using them in your\n[application. For more information, see the .NET Framework technologies unavailable on .NET Core and](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/porting/net-framework-tech-unavailable)\n[.NET 5+](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/porting/net-framework-tech-unavailable) article.\n\n45 CHAPTER 5 | Example of migrating to the latest .NET\n\n**Regenerate autogenerated clients**\n\nIf your application uses autogenerated code, such as a WCF client, you may need to regenerate this\ncode to target .NET. Sometimes, you can find some missing references since they may not be included\n[as part of the default .NET assemblies set. Using a tool like https://apisof.net/, you can easily locate](https://apisof.net/)\nthe assembly the missing reference lives in and add it from NuGet.\n\n**Rolling back package versions**\n\nAs a general rule, we\u2019ve previously stated that you better update every single package version to be\ncompatible with .NET. However, you can find that targeting an updated and compatible version of an\nassembly just doesn\u2019t pay off. If the cost of change isn\u2019t acceptable, you can consider rolling back\npackage versions keeping the ones you use on .NET Framework. Although they may not be targeting\n.NET, they should work well unless they call some unsupported APIs.", "**Run and test**": "Once you have your application building with no errors, you can start the last step of the migration by\ntesting every functionality.\n\nIn this final step, you can find several different issues depending on the complexity of your application\nand the dependencies and APIs you\u2019re using.\n\nFor example, if you use configuration files ( _app.config_ ), you may find some errors at run time like\nConfiguration Sections not present. Using the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration NuGet package\nshould fix that error.\n\nAnother reason for errors is the use of the BeginInvoke and EndInvoke methods because they aren\u2019t\nsupported on .NET. They aren\u2019t supported on .NET because they have a dependency on Remoting,\nwhich doesn\u2019t exist on .NET. To solve this issue, try to use the await keyword (when available) or the\n[Task.Run](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.run) method.\n\nYou can use compatibility analyzers to let you identify APIs and code patterns in your code that can\n[potentially cause problems at run time with .NET.

But with the new SDKstyle project, every code file present underneath the project file location is included by default. That is,\nthe new .NET Core project tries to compile the files inside the _Helper_ folder. Since that folder isn\u2019t\nneeded, you can safely delete it.\n\nIf you compile the project again and execute it, you won\u2019t see the product images. The problem is that\nnow the path to the files has slightly changed. To fix this issue, you need to add another level of depth\nin the path, updating in the file CatalogView.cs the line:\n\n51 CHAPTER 5 | Example of migrating to the latest .NET\n\n```\nstring image_name = Environment.CurrentDirectory +\n\"\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Assets\\\\Images\\\\Catalog\\\\\" + catalogItems.Picturefilename;\n\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nstring image_name = Environment.CurrentDirectory +\n\"\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Assets\\\\Images\\\\Catalog\\\\\" + catalogItems.Picturefilename;\n\n```\n\nAfter this change, you can check that the application launches and runs as expected on .NET 7.", "Migrating a WPF application": "We\u2019ll use the Shop.ClassicWPF sample application to perform the migration.

The declarative method contained in the\npackage manifest lets the OS keep track of every asset your application needs. It also provides a true\nclean uninstall with no side effects.\n\n**Disk space optimization**\n\nMSIX is optimized to reduce the footprint that an application has on the user\u2019s machine disk space. It\ncreates a single instance storage of your files. That is, if you have two different packages with the\nsame DLL, the DLL isn\u2019t installed twice. The platform takes care of that problem because it knows all\nthe files that a particular app installed thanks to its declarative nature. It also allows you to have\ndifferent versions of a DLL working side by side.\n\nWith the use of resource packages, you can easily create multilingual apps and the OS takes care of\ninstalling the ones that are used.\n\n**Network optimization**\n\nMSIX detects the differences on the files at the byte block level enabling a feature called differential\nupdates. What this means is that only the updated byte blocks are downloaded on application\nupdates.\n\n59 CHAPTER 6 | Deploying Modern Desktop Applications\n\nWith streaming installation, the user can quickly start working on your application while other parts of\nthe app are downloaded on the background.
