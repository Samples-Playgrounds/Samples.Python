{"Modernizing Desktop Apps on Windows with .NET 7": {"Introduction": "This book is about strategies you can adopt to move your existing desktop applications through the path of modernization and incorporate the latest runtime, language, and platform features. You'll discover that there's no unique recipe as each application is different, and so are your requirements and preferences. The good news is that there are common approaches you can apply to add new features and capabilities to your applications. Some of them won't even require major modifications of your code. In this book, we'll reveal how all those features work behind the scenes and explain the mechanics of their implementations. Moreover, you'll find some common scenarios for modernizing existing desktop applications shown in detail so you can find inspiration for evolving your projects.\n\nMicrosoft's approach to modernizing existing applications is to give you the flexibility to create your own customized path. All the modernization strategies described in this book are mostly independent. You can choose ones that are relevant for your application and skip others that aren't important for you. In other words, you can mix and match the strategies to best address your application needs.", "Who should use the book": "This book for developers and solution architects who want to modernize existing Windows Forms and WPF desktop applications to leverage the benefits of .NET and Windows 10.\n\nYou might also find this book useful if you're a technical decision maker, such as an enterprise architect or a development lead or director who wants an overview of the benefits of updating existing desktop applications.", "How to use the book": "This book addresses the \"why\"\u2014why you might want to modernize your existing applications, and the specific benefits you get from using NET and MSIX to modernize your desktop apps. The content of the book is designed for architects and technical decision makers who want an overview, but who don't need to focus on implementation and technical, step-by-step details.\n\nAlong the different chapters, sample implementation code snippets and screenshots are provided, with chapter 5 devoted to showcase a complete migration process for sample applications.", "What this book doesn't cover": "This book covers a specific subset of scenarios that are focused on lift-and-shift scenarios, outlining the way to gain the benefits of modernizing without the effort of rewriting code.\n\nThis book isn't about developing modern applications with .NET from scratch or about getting started with Windows Forms and WPF. It focuses on how you can update existing desktop applications with the latest technologies for desktop development.\n\n![](_page_3_Picture_0.jpeg)", "Samples used in this book": "To highlight the necessary steps to perform a modernization, we'll be using a sample application called eShopModernizing. This application has two flavors, Windows Forms and WPF, and we'll show a step-by-step process on how to perform the modernization on both of them to .NET.\n\nAlso, on the GitHub repository for this book, you'll find the results of the process, which you can consult with if you decide to follow the step-by-step tutorial.", "Contents": "| Why modern desktop applications              | 1  |\n|----------------------------------------------|----|\n| Introduction                                 | 1  |\n| A story of one company                       | 1  |\n| Your story                                   | 1  |\n| Desktop applications nowadays                | 1  |\n| Windows Forms                                | 3  |\n| WPF                                          | 4  |\n| UWP                                          | 4  |\n| A tale of two platforms                      | 5  |\n| Paths to modernization                       | 8  |\n| Modern features                              | 8  |\n| Deployment                                   | 8  |\n| Installation                                 | 8  |\n| What's new with .NET for Desktop?

They have chosen a brand-new framework called Windows Forms (also known as WinForms) for their application development. Over the years, the project evolved into a mature, well-tested, and time-proven application with hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Time passed and .NET Framework 2.0 is no longer the hot new technology. The developers who are working on this application are facing a dilemma. They'd like to use the latest stack of technologies in their development and have their application look and \"feel\" modern. At the same time, they don't want to throw away the great product they have built over 15 years and rewrite the entire application from scratch.", "<span id=\"page-7-3\"></span>**Your story**": "You might find yourself in the same boat, where you have mature Windows Forms or Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications that have proved their reliability over the years.

At the same time, since those applications were written some time ago, they might be missing capabilities like modern look, performance, integration with new devices and platform features, and so on, which gives them a feel of \"old tech\". There's another problem that might concern you as a developer. While working on the older .NET Framework versions and maintaining applications that were written a while ago, you might feel like you aren't learning new technologies and missing out on building modern technical skills. If that is your story \u2013 this book is for you!", "<span id=\"page-7-4\"></span>Desktop applications nowadays": "Before the rise of the Internet, desktop applications were the main approach to building software systems. Developers could choose any programming language, such as COBOL, Fortran, VB6, or C++. But whether they developed small tools or complex distributed architectures, they were all desktop applications.\n\nThen, Internet technologies started shocking the development world and winning over more engineers with advantages like easy deployment and simplified distribution processes. The fact that once a web application was deployed to production all users got automatic updates made a huge impact on software agility.\n\nHowever, the Internet infrastructure, underlying protocols, and standards like HTTP and HTML weren't designed for building complex applications. In fact, the major development effort back then was aimed at just one goal: to give web applications the same capabilities that desktop applications have, such as fast data input and state management.\n\nEven though web and mobile applications have grown at an incredible pace, for certain tasks desktop applications still hold the number one place in terms of efficiency and performance. That explains why there are millions of developers who are building their projects with WPF and WinForms and the amount of those applications is constantly growing.\n\nHere are some reasons for choosing desktop applications in your development:\n\n[\"Desktop apps have better interaction with the user's PC.\", 'The performance of desktop applications for complex calculations is much higher than the performance of web applications.', 'Running custom logic on the client-side is possible but much harder with a web application.', 'Using multithreading is easier and more efficient in a desktop application.', \"The learning curve for designing user interfaces (UIs) isn't steep. And for WinForms, it's intuitive with the drag-and-drop experience of the Windows Forms designer.\", \"It's easy to start coding and testing your algorithms without the need to set up a server infrastructure or to care about connectivity problems, firewalls, and browser compatibility.\", 'Debugging is powerful as compared to web debugging.', 'Access to hardware devices, such as camera, Bluetooth, or card readers, is easy.', 'Since the technology has been around for a while, there are many experts and a knowledge base available to develop desktop applications.']\n\nSo, as you can see, developing for desktop is great for many reasons. The technology is mature and time-tested, the development cycle is fast, the debugging is powerful and arguably, desktop apps have less complexity and are easier to get started with.\n\nMicrosoft offered many UI desktop technologies throughout the years from Win32 introduced in 1995 to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) released in 2016.\n\n![](_page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nAccording to a survey published by Telerik on April 2016, the most popular technologies for building Windows desktop apps are Windows Forms, WPF, and UWP.\n\n![](_page_9_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nYou can develop in any of them using C# and Visual Basic, but let's take a closer look.", "<span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>**Windows Forms**": "First released in 2002, Windows Forms is a managed framework and is the oldest, most-used desktop technology built on the Windows graphics device interface (GDI) engine. It offers a smooth drag-anddrop experience for developing user interfaces in Visual Studio. At the same time, Windows Forms relies on the Visual Studio Designer as the main way you develop your UI, so creating visual components from code isn't trivial.\n\nThe following list summarizes the main characteristics of Windows Forms:\n\n['Mature technology with lots of code samples and documentation.', 'Powerful and productive designer. Not so convenient to design UI \"from code\".', \"Easy and intuitive to learn, thanks to the designer's drag-and-drop experience.\", 'Supported on any Windows version.', 'Supported on .NET Core 3.0 and later versions.']", "<span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>**WPF**": "Based on the XAML language specification, WPF favors a clear separation between UI and code. XAML offers capabilities like templating, styling, and binding, which is suited for building large applications. Like Windows Forms, it's a managed framework, but the design is modular and reusable.\n\nHere are the main features of WPF:\n\n['Mature technology.', 'Designer is available, but developers usually prefer to create the design from code using declarative XAML.', 'The learning curve is steeper than Windows Forms.', 'Supported on any Windows version.', 'Supported on .NET Core 3.0 and later versions.']", "<span id=\"page-10-1\"></span>**UWP**": "UWP isn't only a presentation framework like WPF and Windows Forms, but it's also a platform itself. This platform has:\n\n['Its own API set (the Windows Runtime API).', 'A new deployment system (MSIX)', 'A modern application lifecycle model (for low battery consumption).', 'A new Resource Management System (based on PRI files).']\n\nThe platform was created to support all kinds of input systems (like ink, touch, gamepad, mouse, keyboard, gaze, and so on) in all form-factors with performance and low battery consumption in mind. For these reasons, the shell of the Windows 10 OS uses parts of the UWP platform.\n\n![](_page_11_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nUWP contains a presentation framework that is XAML-based, like WPF, but it has some important differences such as:\n\n['Applications are executed in app containers. App containers control what resources a UWP app can access.', 'Supported only on Windows 10 and Windows 11.', 'Apps can be deployed through Microsoft Store for easier deployment.', 'Designed as part of the Windows Runtime API.', 'Contains an extensive set of rich built-in controls and additional controls are available through the Microsoft UI Library NuGet packages (WinUI library), updated every few months.']", "<span id=\"page-11-0\"></span>A tale of two platforms": "In the last 20 years, while UI desktop technologies were growing and following the path from Windows Forms to UWP, the hardware was also evolving from heavyweight PC units with small CRT monitors to high-DPI monitors and lightweight tablets and phones with different data input techniques like Touch and Ink. These changes resulted in creating two different concepts: a Desktop Application and a Modern Application. A Modern Application is one that considers different device form factors, various input and output methods, and leverages modern desktop features while running on a sandboxed execution model. The (traditional) Desktop Application, on the other hand, is an application that needs a solid UI with a high density of controls that is best operated with a mouse and a keyboard.\n\nThe following table describes the differences between the two concepts:\n\n| Aspect of comparison | Modern Application                                                                                                                                                      | Desktop Application                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Security             | Contained execution & Great<br>Fundamentals.

To do that, Microsoft has performed a bidirectional effort between the two platforms.\n\n![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\n['Move Desktop Application scenarios into Modern Application platform.

A new requirement comes in to enable the customer to sign the order using a tablet pen. Inking is native in today's operating systems and technologies, but it wasn't available when the app was developed.\n\nThis path will show you how you can leverage modern desktop features into your existing desktop development.", "<span id=\"page-14-2\"></span>**Deployment**": "Modern development cycles have stressed the importance of providing agility with regard to how new versions of applications are deployed to individual users. Since Windows Forms and WPF applications are based on a particular version of the .NET Framework that must be present on the machine, they can't take advantage of new .NET Framework version features without the intervention of the IT people with the risk of having side effects for other apps running on the same machine. It has limited the innovation pace for developers forcing them to stay on outdated versions of the .NET Framework.\n\nSince the launch of .NET Core 3.0, you can leverage a new approach of deploying multiple versions of .NET side by side and specifying which version of .NET each application should target. This way, you can use the newest features in one application while being confident you aren't going to break any other applications.", "<span id=\"page-14-3\"></span>**Installation**": "Desktop applications always rely on some sort of installation process before the user can start using them. This fact brought into the game a set of technologies, from MSI and ClickOnce to custom installers or even XCOPY deployment. Any of these methods deals with delicate problems because applications need a way to access shared resources on the machine. Sometimes installation needs to access the Registry to insert or update new Key Values, sometimes to update shared DLLs referenced by the main application. This behavior causes a continuous headache for users, creating this perception that once you install some application, your computer will never be the same, even if you uninstall it afterwards.\n\nIn this book, we'll introduce a new way of installing applications with MSIX that solves the problem described earlier. You'll learn how you can easily set up packaging, installation, and updates for your application.\n\n**CHAPTER** 2"}, "<span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>What's new with .NET for Desktop?": {"The motivation behind .NET Core": "Since its launch in 2002, .NET Framework has evolved to support many technologies, like Windows Forms, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, Windows Store, and many others. All of them are different in nature. Therefore, Microsoft approached this evolution by taking parts of .NET Framework and creating a different application stack for each technology. That way, development capabilities could be customized for the needs of the specific stack, which maximized the potential of every platform. That led to fragmentation on the versions of .NET Framework maintained by different independent teams. All of these stacks have a common structure, containing an app model, a framework, and a runtime, but they differ in the implementation of each of the parts.\n\nIf you're targeting only one of these platforms, you can use this model. However, in many cases you might need more than one target platform in the same solution. For example, your application may have a desktop admin part, a customer-facing web site that shares the back-end logic running on a server, and even a mobile client. In this case, you need a unified coding experience that can span all of these .NET verticals.\n\nBy the time Windows 8 was released, the concept of Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) was born. Originally, .NET Framework was designed around the assumption that it would always be deployed as a single unit, so [factoring](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)) wasn't a concern. To face the problem of code sharing between verticals, the driving force was on how to refactor the framework. The idea of contracts is to provide a well-factored API surface area. Contracts are simply assemblies that you compile against and are designed with proper factoring in mind taking care of the dependencies between them.\n\nThis led to reasoning about the API differences between verticals at the assembly level, as opposed to at the individual API level like previously. This aspect enabled a class library experience that can target multiple verticals, also known as portable class libraries.\n\n![](_page_16_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nWith PCL, the experience of development is unified across verticals based on the API shape. And the most pressing need to create libraries running on different verticals is also addressed. But there's a great challenge: APIs are only portable when the implementation is moved forward across all the verticals.\n\nA better approach is to unify the implementations across verticals by providing a well-factored implementation instead of a well-factored view. It's a lot simpler to ask each team that owns a specific component to think about how their APIs work across all verticals than trying to retroactively provide a consistent API stack on top. This is where .NET Standard comes in.\n\nAnother large challenge has to do with how .NET Framework is deployed. .NET Framework is a machine-wide framework. Any changes made to it affect all applications that take a dependency on it. Although this deployment model has many advantages, such as reducing disk space and centralized access to services, it presents some pitfalls.\n\nTo start with, it's difficult for application developers to take a dependency on a recently released framework. They either have to take a dependency on the latest OS or provide an application installer that installs .NET Framework along with the application. If you're a web developer, you might not even have this option as the IT department establishes the server supported version.\n\nEven if you're willing to go through the trouble of providing an installer to chain in .NET Framework setup, you may find that upgrading .NET Framework can break other applications.\n\nDespite the efforts to provide backward compatible versions of the framework, there are compatible changes that can break applications. For example, adding an interface to an existing type can change how this type is serialized and cause breaking problems depending on the existing code. Because the .NET Framework installed base is huge, fighting against these breaking scenarios slows down the pace of innovations inside .NET Framework.\n\nTo solve all these issues, Microsoft developed .NET Core as the evolution of the .NET development platform.", "<span id=\"page-17-0\"></span>Introduction to .NET Core": ".NET Core, which is now referred to as just \".NET\", is the evolution of Microsoft's .NET technology into a modular, cross-platform, open source, and cloud-ready platform. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and some ARM-based architectures like Android and IoT.\n\nThe purpose of .NET Core is to provide a unified platform for all types of applications, which includes Windows, cross-platform, and mobile applications. [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/net-standard) enabled this by providing shared base APIs, which every application model needs, and excluding any application model-specific API.\n\nThis framework gives applications many benefits in terms of efficiency and performance, simplifying the packaging and deployment in the different supported platforms.\n\nThe benefits of .NET Core come from these three characteristics:\n\n['**Cross-platform:** It allows application execution on different platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).', '**Open source:** .NET Core platform is open source and available through GitHub, fostering transparency and community contributions.', '**Supported:** Microsoft officially supports .NET Core.']\n\nStarting with .NET Core 3.0, besides the existing support for web and cloud, there's also support for desktop, IoT, and AI domains. The goal for this framework is impressive: to target every type of .NET development present and future.", "<span id=\"page-17-1\"></span>.NET 5+ is .NET Core vNext": ".NET 5 was the next step forward with .NET Core. .NET 5 improved .NET in a few key ways:\n\n['Produced a single .NET runtime and framework that can be used everywhere and that has uniform runtime behaviors and developer experiences.', 'Expanded the capabilities of .NET by taking the best of .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and Mono.', 'Built that product out of a single code-base that developers (Microsoft and the community) can work on and expand together and that improves all scenarios.']\n\n.NET 5 was a game-changer for .NET. With .NET 5 and later versions, your code and project files look and feel the same no matter which type of app you're building. You have access to the same runtime, APIs, and language capabilities with each app. This includes new performance improvements that get committed to the runtime almost daily. .NET 6 and .NET 7 made further improvements in reliability, performance, new APIs, and language features.

You could be asking questions like: Do I have to abandon it? Is it going to disappear? What are my choices to modernize the applications I have on .NET Framework?\n\nIn 2019, .NET Framework 4.8 was released. It included three major improvements for desktop applications:\n\n['**Modern browser and media controls**: New controls were added that take advantage of Microsoft Edge and newer media players that support the latest standards.', \"**Access to UWP controls**: UWP introduced controls that take advantage of the latest Windows features and touch displays. With .NET Framework 4.8, you don't have to rewrite your applications to use these new features and controls, so you can use these new features in your existing WPF or Windows Forms code.\", '**High-DPI improvements**: The resolution of displays increased to 4K and 8K, so, .NET Framework 4.8 added new HDPI improvements to make sure existing Windows Forms and WPF applications can look great on these new displays.']\n\nSince .NET Framework is installed on millions of machines, Microsoft will continue to support it but won't add new features.\n\n.NET (Core) is the open-source, cross-platform, and fast-moving version of the .NET family. Because of its side-by-side nature, it can take changes without the fear of breaking any application. This means that .NET will get new APIs and language features over time that .NET Framework won't. Also, .NET already has features that were impossible for .NET Framework, such as:\n\n\u2022 **Side-by-side versions of .NET supporting Windows Forms and WPF**: This solves the problem of side effects when updating the machine's framework version. Multiple versions of .NET can be installed on the same machine and each application specifies which version of\n\n.NET it should use. Even more, now you can develop and run Windows Forms and WPF on top of .NET.\n\n['**Embed .NET directly into an application**: You can deploy .NET as part of your application package. This enables you to take advantage of the latest version, features, and APIs without having to wait for a specific version to be installed on the machine.', '**Take advantage of .NET features**: .NET is fast-moving and open-source. Its side-by-side nature enables fast introduction of new innovative APIs and Base Class Library (BCL) improvements without the risk of breaking compatibility. Now Windows Forms and WPF applications can take advantage of the latest .NET features, which also includes fundamental fixes for things like runtime performance and high-DPI support.']\n\n.NET Framework will be fully supported and will always be a part of Windows. However, if you want to use the newest language features and APIs in the future, you'll need to move your applications to .NET. For brand-new desktop apps, we recommend starting directly on .NET 6 or a later version. It's lightweight and cross-platform, runs side by side, has high performance, and fits perfectly on containers and microservices architectures.\n\n![](_page_19_Figure_4.jpeg)", "<span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>.NET Standard vs. PCL": "[.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/net-standard) is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET implementations.

Windows 10 and Windows 11 accomplish this goal by placing the application inside a UWP package. It detects and redirects some changes to the file system and registry at run time to fulfill the promise of a trusted and clean install and uninstall behavior of an application provided by packaging.\n\nPackages that you create for your desktop application are desktop-only, full-trust applications that aren't sandboxed, although there's lightweight virtualization applied to the app for writes to HKCU and AppData. This virtualization allows them to interact with other apps the same way classic desktop applications do.\n\n**Installation**\n\nApp packages are installed under *%ProgramFiles%\\WindowsApps\\package\\_name*, with the executable titled app\\_name.exe. Each package folder contains a manifest (named AppxManifest.xml) that contains a special XML namespace for packaged apps. Inside that manifest file is an <EntryPoint> element, which references the full-trust app. When that application is launched, it doesn't run inside an app container, but instead it runs as the user as it normally would.\n\nAfter deployment, package files are marked read-only and heavily locked down by the operating system. Windows prevents apps from launching if these files are tampered with.\n\n**File system**\n\nThe OS supports different levels of file system operations for packaged desktop applications, depending on the folder location.\n\nWhen trying to access the user's *AppData* folder, the system creates a private per-user, per-app location behind the scenes. This creates the illusion that the packaged application is editing the real *AppData* when it's actually modifying a private copy. By redirecting writes this way, the system can track all file modifications made by the app. It can then clean all those files when uninstalling reducing system \"rot\" and providing a better application removal experience for the user.\n\n**Registry**\n\nApp packages contain a registry.dat file, which serves as the logical equivalent of HKLM\\Software in the real registry. At run time, this virtual registry merges the contents of this hive into the native system hive to provide a singular view of both.\n\nAll writes are kept during package upgrade and only deleted when the application is uninstalled.\n\n**Uninstallation**\n\nWhen the user uninstalls a package, all files and folders located under C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\package\\_name are removed, as well as any redirected writes to AppData or the registry that were captured during the process.\n\nFor details about how a packaged application handles installation, file access, registry, and uninstallation, see [https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes)[scenes.](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes)\n\nYou can get a complete list of things to check on [https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-prepare.](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-prepare)", "<span id=\"page-32-0\"></span>How to add WinRT APIs to your desktop project": "In this section, you can find a walkthrough on how to integrate Toast Notifications in an existing WPF application. Although it's simple from the code perspective, it helps illustrate the whole process. Notifications are one of the many available WinRT APIs available that you can use in .NET app. In this case, the API requires a Package Identity. This process is more straightforward if the APIs don't require Package Identity.\n\nLet's take an existing WPF sample app that reads files and shows its contents on the screen. The goal is to display a Toast Notification when the application starts.\n\n![](_page_33_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nFirst, you should check in the following link whether the Windows 10 or Windows 11 API that you'll use requires a Package Identity:\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-supported-api](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-supported-api)\n\nOur sample will use the [Windows.UI.Notifications.Notification](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.notifications.notification) API that requires a packaged identity:\n\n![](_page_33_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nTo access the WinRT API, add a reference to the Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Contracts NuGet package and this package will do the magic behind the scenes (see details at [https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2019/04/30/calling-windows-10-apis-from-a-desktop](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2019/04/30/calling-windows-10-apis-from-a-desktop-application-just-got-easier/)[application-just-got-easier/\\)](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2019/04/30/calling-windows-10-apis-from-a-desktop-application-just-got-easier/).\n\nYou're now prepared to start adding some code.\n\nCreate a ShowToastNotification method that will be called on application startup. It just builds a toast notification from an XML pattern:\n\n```\nprivate void ShowNotification(string title, string content, string image)\n{\n string xmlString = $@\"<toast><visual><binding template = \n'ToastGeneric'><text>{title}</text><text>{content}</text><image \nsrc=>'{image}'</image></binding></visual></toast>\";\n XmlDocument toastXml = new XmlDocument();\n toastXml.LoadXml(xmlString);\n ToastNotification toast = new ToastNotification(toastXml);\n ToastNotificationManager.CreateToastNotifier().Show(toast);\n}\n```\n\nAlthough the project builds, there are errors because the Notifications API requires a Package Identity and you didn't provide it. Adding a Windows Packaging Project to the solution will fix the issue:\n\n![](_page_34_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nSelect the minimum Windows version you want to support and the version you're targeting. Not all the WinRT APIs are supported in all Windows 10 and Windows 11 versions. Each Windows 10 or Windows 11 update adds new APIs that are only available from this version; down-level support isn't available.\n\n![](_page_35_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nNext step is to add the WPF application to the Windows Packaging Project by adding a project reference:\n\n![](_page_36_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_36_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nA Windows Packaging Project can package several apps so you should set which one is the Entry Point:\n\n![](_page_37_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nNext step is to set the WPF Project as the startup Project in the solution configuration.

The concept is similar to having an iFrame inside a web page that shows content from a different page.\n\nBesides adding functionality from the Windows 10 and Windows 11 APIs, you can add pieces of UWP XAML inside of your app using XAML Islands.\n\nWindows 10 1903 update introduced a set of APIs that allow hosting UWP XAML content in Win32 windows. Only apps running on Windows 10 1903 or later can use XAML Islands.", "<span id=\"page-41-0\"></span>**The road to XAML Islands**": "The road to XAML Islands started in 2012 when Microsoft introduced the WinRT APIs as a framework to modernize the Win32 apps (Windows Forms, WPF, and native Win32 apps). However, the new UI controls inside WinRT were available for new applications but not for existing ones.\n\nIn 2015, along with Windows 10, UWP was born. UWP allows you to create apps that work across Windows devices like XBox, Mobile, and Desktop. One year later, Microsoft announced Desktop Bridge (formerly known as Project Centennial). Desktop Bridge is a set of tools that allowed developers to bring their existing Win32 apps to the Microsoft Store. More capabilities were added in 2017, allowing developers to enhance their Win32 apps leveraging some of the new Windows 10 APIs, like live tiles and notifications on the action center. But still, no new UI controls.\n\nAt Build 2018, Microsoft announced a way for developers to use the new Windows 10 XAML controls into their current Win32 apps, without fully migrating their apps to UWP. It was branded as UWP XAML Islands.", "<span id=\"page-41-1\"></span>**How it works**": "The Windows 10 1903 update introduced several XAML hosting APIs. Two of them are WindowsXamlManager and DesktopWindowXamlSource.\n\nThe WindowsXamlManager class handles the UWP XAML Framework. Its InitializeForCurrentThread method loads the UWP XAML Framework inside the current thread of the Win32 app.\n\nThe DesktopWindowXamlSource is the instance of your XAML Island content. It has the Content property, which you're responsible for instantiating and setting. The DesktopWindowXamlSource renders and gets its input from an HWND. It needs to know to which other HWND it will attach the XAML Island's one, and you're responsible for sizing and positioning the parent's HWND.\n\nWPF or Windows Forms developers don't usually deal with HWND inside their code, so it may be hard to understand and handle HWND pointers and the underlying wiring stuff to communicate Win32 and UWP worlds.", "**The XAML Islands .NET Wrappers**": "The Windows Community Toolkit has a set the XAML Islands .NET wrappers for WPF or Windows Forms that make easier to use XAML Islands. These wrappers manage the HWNDs, the focus management, among other things. Windows Forms and WPF developers should use these wrappers.\n\nThe Windows Community Toolkit offers two types of controls: Wrapped Controls and Hosting Controls.\n\n**Wrapped Controls**\n\nThese wrapped controls wrap some UWP controls into Windows Forms or WPF controls, hiding UWP concepts for those developers. These controls are:\n\n['WebView and WebViewCompatible', 'InkCanvas and InkToolbar', 'MediaPlayerElement', 'MapControl']\n\nAdd the Microsoft.Toolkit.Wpf.UI.Controls package to your project, include the reference to the namespace, and start using them.\n\n```\n<Window\n ...\n xmlns:uwpControls=\"clr-\nnamespace:Microsoft.Toolkit.Wpf.UI.Controls;assembly=Microsoft.Toolkit.Wpf.UI.Controls\">\n<Grid>\n <Grid.RowDefinitions>\n <RowDefinition Height=\"Auto\"/>\n <RowDefinition Height=\"\\*\"/>\n </Grid.RowDefinitions>\n <uwpControls:InkToolbar TargetInkCanvas=\"{x:Reference Name=inkCanvas}\"/>\n <uwpControls:InkCanvas Grid.Row=\"1\" x:Name=\"inkCanvas\" />\n</Grid>\n```\n\n**Hosting controls**\n\nThe power of XAML Islands extends to most first-party controls, third-party controls, and custom controls developed for UWP, which can be integrated into Windows Forms and WPF as \"Islands\" with fully functional UI. The WindowsXamlHost control for WPF and Windows Forms allows doing this.\n\nFor example, to use the WindowsXamlHost control in WPF, add a reference to the Microsoft.Toolkit.Wpf.UI.XamlHost package provided by the Windows Community Toolkit.\n\nOnce you've placed your WindowsXamlHost into your UI code, specify which UWP type you want to load. You can choose to use a wrapped control like a Button or a more complex one composed of several different controls, which are a custom UWP control.\n\nThe following example shows how to add a UWP Button:\n\n```\n<Window\n ...\n xmlns:xamlhost=\"clr-\nnamespace:Microsoft.Toolkit.Wpf.UI.XamlHost;assembly=Microsoft.Toolkit.Wpf.UI.XamlHost\">\n<xamlhost:WindowsXamlHost x:Name=\"myUwpButton\"\n InitialTypeName=\"Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Button\" />\n```\n\nThere's a clear recommendation on how to approach this and it's better to have one single and bigger XAML Island containing a custom composite control than to have several islands with one control on each.\n\nOne of the core features of XAML is binding and it works between your Win32 code and the island. So, you can bind, for instance, a Win32 Textbox with a UWP Textbox. One important thing to consider is that these bindings are one-way bindings, from UWP to Win32, so if you update the Textbox inside the XAML Island the Win32 Textbox will be updated, but not the other way around.\n\nTo see a walkthrough about how to use XAML Islands, see:\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-standard-control-with-xaml](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-standard-control-with-xaml-islands)[islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-standard-control-with-xaml-islands)\n\n**Adding UWP XAML custom controls**\n\nA XAML custom control is a control (or user control) created by you or by third parties (including WinUI 2.x controls). To host a custom UWP control in a Windows Forms or WPF app, you'll need:\n\n['To use the WindowsXamlHost UWP control in your .NET app.', 'To create a UWP app project that defines a XamlApplication object.']\n\nYour WPF or Windows Forms project must have access to an instance of the Microsoft.Toolkit.Win32.UI.XamlHost.XamlApplication class provided by the Windows Community Toolkit. This object acts as a root metadata provider for loading metadata for custom UWP XAML types in assemblies in the current directory of your application. The recommended way to do this is to add a Blank App (Universal Windows) project to the same solution as your WPF or Windows Forms project and revise the default App class in this project.\n\nThe custom UWP XAML control can be included on this UWP app or in an independent UWP Class Library project that you reference in the same solution as your WPF or Windows Forms project.\n\nYou can check a detailed step-by-step process description at:\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-custom-control-with-xaml](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-custom-control-with-xaml-islands)[islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-custom-control-with-xaml-islands)", "**The Windows UI Library (WinUI 2)**": "Besides the inbox Windows 10 controls that comes with the OS, the same UWP XAML team also delivers additional controls in the Windows UI Library (**WinUI 2**).

To decouple these two evolution cycles and foster innovation, Microsoft is actively working on the WinUI project.\n\nStarting with WinUI 2 in 2018, Microsoft started shipping some new XAML UI controls and features as separate NuGet packages that build on top of the UWP SDK.\n\n![](_page_45_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nWinUI 3 is under active development and will greatly expand the scope of WinUI to include the full UI platform, which will be fully decoupled from the UWP SDK:\n\n![](_page_45_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nXAML framework will now be developed on GitHub and shipped out of band as [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/what-is-nuget) packages.\n\nThe existing UWP XAML APIs that ship as part of the OS will no longer receive new feature updates. They will still receive security updates and critical fixes according to the Windows 10 support lifecycle.\n\nThe Universal Windows Platform contains more than just the XAML framework (for example, application and security model, media pipeline, Xbox and Windows 10 shell integrations, broad device support) and will continue to evolve.

Select the **Microsoft WCF Web Service** option.\n\n![](_page_55_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nIf you have the WCF Service in the same solution as we have in this example, you can select the **Discover** option instead of specifying a service URL.\n\n![](_page_55_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nOnce the service is located, the tool reflects the API contract implemented by the service. Change the name of the namespace to be eShopServiceReference as shown in the following image:\n\n![](_page_56_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nSelect the **Finish** button. After a while, you'll see the generated code.\n\nYou should see three autogenerated files:\n\n[['*Getting Started*: a link to GitHub to provide some information on WCF.'], ['*ConnectedService.json*: configuration parameters to connect to the service.'], ['*Reference.cs*: the actual WCF client code.']]\n\n![](_page_57_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nIf you compile again, you'll see many errors coming from *.cs* files inside the *Helper* folder. This folder was present in the .NET Framework version but not included in the old *.csproj*. But with the new SDKstyle project, every code file present underneath the project file location is included by default. That is, the new .NET Core project tries to compile the files inside the *Helper* folder. Since that folder isn't needed, you can safely delete it.\n\nIf you compile the project again and execute it, you won't see the product images. The problem is that now the path to the files has slightly changed. To fix this issue, you need to add another level of depth in the path, updating in the file CatalogView.cs the line:\n\n```\nstring image_name = Environment.CurrentDirectory +\n\"\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Assets\\\\Images\\\\Catalog\\\\\" + catalogItems.Picturefilename;\nto\nstring image_name = Environment.CurrentDirectory +\n\"\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Assets\\\\Images\\\\Catalog\\\\\" + catalogItems.Picturefilename;\n```\n\nAfter this change, you can check that the application launches and runs as expected on .NET 7.", "<span id=\"page-58-0\"></span>Migrating a WPF application": "We'll use the Shop.ClassicWPF sample application to perform the migration. The following image shows a screenshot of the app before migration:\n\n![](_page_58_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nThis application uses a local SQL Server Express database to hold the product catalog information. This database is accessed directly from the WPF application.\n\nFirst, you must update the *.csproj* file to the new SDK style used by .NET Core applications. You'll follow the same steps described in the Windows Forms migration: you'll unload the project, open the *.csproj* file, update its contents, and reload the project.\n\nIn this case, delete all the content of the *.csproj* file and replace it with the following code:\n\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n <PropertyGroup>\n <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>\n <TargetFramework>net7.0-windows</TargetFramework>\n <UseWpf>true</UseWpf>\n <GenerateAssemblyInfo>false</GenerateAssemblyInfo>\n </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\nIf you reload the project and compile it, you'll get the following error:\n\n![](_page_59_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nSince you've deleted all the *.csproj* contents, you've lost a project reference specification present in the old project. You just need to add this line to the *.csproj* file to include the project reference back:\n\n```\n<ItemGroup>\n <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\\\eShop.SqlProvider\\\\eShop.SqlProvider.csproj\" />\n<ItemGroup>\n```\n\nYou can also let Visual Studio help you by right-clicking on the **Dependencies** node and selecting **Add Project Reference**.

One of the main problems with this approach is commonly known as \"packaging paralysis\". The problem is that this cycle repeats every time there's an app update or an OS update.\n\nYou can see the process reflected on the following picture:\n\n![](_page_62_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\nCompanies need a way to break this packaging cycle into three independent cycles:\n\n['OS updates', 'Application updates', 'Customization']\n\n![](_page_63_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nThe previous diagram shows that you can:\n\n['Update the underlying OS without having to repackage your apps.', 'Enable customizations from IT without the need to repackage the original developer package.']\n\nThis radical change leads us to the new and modern IT lifecycle as shown in the following picture:\n\n![](_page_64_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nDevelopers create the app and generate an MSIX package that IT Pros can consume and configure without the need of repackaging.

The declarative method contained in the package manifest lets the OS keep track of every asset your application needs. It also provides a true clean uninstall with no side effects.\n\n**Disk space optimization**\n\nMSIX is optimized to reduce the footprint that an application has on the user's machine disk space. It creates a single instance storage of your files. That is, if you have two different packages with the same DLL, the DLL isn't installed twice. The platform takes care of that problem because it knows all the files that a particular app installed thanks to its declarative nature. It also allows you to have different versions of a DLL working side by side.\n\nWith the use of resource packages, you can easily create multilingual apps and the OS takes care of installing the ones that are used.\n\n**Network optimization**\n\nMSIX detects the differences on the files at the byte block level enabling a feature called differential updates. What this means is that only the updated byte blocks are downloaded on application updates.\n\n![](_page_66_Picture_1.jpeg)\n\nWith streaming installation, the user can quickly start working on your application while other parts of the app are downloaded on the background.

In this example, we'll use a Windows Forms app.\n\nTo start, add a new project to your solution, select the Windows Application Packaging Project, and give it a name.\n\n![](_page_69_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nYou'll see the structure of the packaging project and note a special folder called *Applications*. Inside this folder, you can specify which applications you want to include in the package. It can be more than one.\n\n![](_page_70_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nRight-click on the *Applications* folder and select the Windows Forms project you want to package from the Visual Studio solution.\n\n![](_page_71_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nAt this point, you can compile and generate the package but let's examine a couple of things. To have a better user experience, Visual Studio can autogenerate all the visual assets a modern application needs to handle icons and tile assets for the tile bar and start menu. Open the *Package.appxmanifest* file to access the Manifest Designer. You can then generate all the visual assets from a given image present on your project just by clicking **Create**.\n\n![](_page_71_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nIf you open the code for the *Package.appxmanifest* file, you can see a couple of interesting things.\n\nRight under <Package>, there's an <Identity> node. This is where your packaged application is going to get its identity, which will be managed by the OS.\n\n![](_page_72_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nIn the <Capabilities> node, you can find all the requirements the application needs, paying special attention to the <rescap:Capability Name=\"runFullTrust\" \\>, which tells the OS to run the app in full trust mode since it's a Win32 application.\n\n![](_page_73_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nSet the packaging project as the startup project for the solution and select *Run*. This is going to:\n\n['Compile the Windows Forms application.', 'Create an MSIX package out of the build results.', 'Deploy the packages.', 'Install it locally on the development machine.', 'Launch the app.']\n\n![](_page_74_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nWith this, you have the clean install and uninstall experience that MSIX provides fully integrated into Windows 10/Windows 11.\n\nThe final stage is about how you deploy the MSIX package to another machine.\n\nRight-click on the packaging project, select the **Store** menu, and then select the **Create App Packages** option.\n\nThen, you can choose between creating a package to upload to the store or creating packages for sideloading. In most modernization scenarios, you'll choose **I want to create packages for sideloading**.\n\n![](_page_75_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nThere you can select the different architectures you want to target as you can include as many as you want into the same MSIX package.\n\nThe final step is to declare where you want to deploy the final installation assets.\n\n![](_page_76_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nYou can choose to use a web server or a shared UNC path on your enterprise file servers. Pay attention to the settings to specify how you want to update your application. We'll cover application updates in the next section.\n\n<span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>For a detailed step-by-step guide, see [Package a desktop app from source code using Visual Studio.](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net)", "Auto Updates in MSIX": "The Windows Store has a great updating mechanism using Windows Update. In most enterprise scenarios, you don't use the Store to distribute your desktop apps. So, you need a similar way to configure updates for your application and pull them to your users.\n\nUsing a combination of Windows 10/Windows 11 features and MSIX packages, you can provide a great updating experience for your users. In fact, the user doesn't need to be technical at all but still benefits from a seamless application update experience.\n\nYou can configure your updates to interact with the user in two different ways:\n\n[\"User prompted updates: The OS shows some autogenerated nice UI to notify the user about the application it's about to install. It builds this UI based on the properties you specify on your installation files.\", \"Silent updates in the background. With this option, your users don't need to be aware of the updates.\"]\n\nYou can also configure when you want to perform updates: either when the application launches or on a regular basis. Thanks to the side-loading features, you can even get these updates while the application is running.\n\nWhen you use this type of deployment, a special file is created called *.appinstaller*. This simple file contains the following sections:\n\n['The location of the *.appinstaller* file', \"The application's main MSIX package properties\", 'The update behavior']\n\nIn combination with this file, Microsoft has designed a special URL protocol to launch the installation process from a link:\n\n```\n<a href=\"ms-appinstaller:?source=http://mywebservice.azureedge.net/MyApp.msix\">Install \napp package </a>\n```\n\nThis protocol works on all browsers and launches the installation process with a great user experience on Windows 10/Windows 11. Since the OS manages the installation process, it's aware of the location this application was installed from and tracks all the files affected by the process.\n\nMSIX creates a user interface for installation automatically showing some properties of the package. This allows for a common installation experience for every app.\n\nOnce you've generated the new MSIX package and moved it to the deployment server, you just have to edit the *.appinstaller* file to reflect these changes: mainly the version and the path to the new MSIX file. The next time the user launches the application, the system will detect the change and download the files for the new version in the background. When the download is finished, installation will execute transparently for your user on new application launch."}}
