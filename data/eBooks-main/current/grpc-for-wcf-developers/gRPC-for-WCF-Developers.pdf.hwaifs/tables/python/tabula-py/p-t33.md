|  0 | Server-streaming RPCs are useful for subscription-style services. They’re also useful for sending large |
|  1 | datasets when it would be inefficient or impossible to build the entire dataset in memory. However,     |
|  2 | streaming responses isn’t as fast as sending repeated fields in a single message. As a rule, streaming  |
|  3 | shouldn’t be used for small datasets.                                                                   |
