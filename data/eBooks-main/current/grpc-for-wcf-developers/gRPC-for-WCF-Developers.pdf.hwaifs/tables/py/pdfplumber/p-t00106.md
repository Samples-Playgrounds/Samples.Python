|  1 | Counter     | Tracks how often something happens, such as    |

|  2 | Gauge       | Records a single value that changes over time, |
|    |             | such as active connections.                    |
|  3 | Histogram   | Measures a distribution of values across       |
|    |             | arbitrary limits. For example, a histogram can |
|    |             | track dataset size, counting how many          |
|    |             | contained <10 records, how many contained      |
|    |             | 11-100 records, how many contained 101-1000    |
|    |             | records, and how many contained >1000          |
|    |             | records.                                       |
|  4 | Meter       | Measures the rate at which an event occurs in  |
|    |             | various time spans.                            |
