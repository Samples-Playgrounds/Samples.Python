|  0 | Counter       | Tracks how often something happens, such as requests and errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  1 | Gauge         | Records a single value that changes over time, such as active connections.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  2 | Histogram     | Measures a distribution of values across arbitrary limits. For example, a histogram can track dataset size, counting how many contained <10 records, how many contained 11-100 records, how many contained 101-1000 records, and how many contained >1000 records. |
|  3 | Meter         | Measures the rate at which an event occurs in various time spans.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
