Imagine the performance of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) NetTCP bindings, combined with the cross-platform interoperability of SOAP. gRPC builds on HTTP/2 and the Protobuf message-encoding protocol to provide high performance, low-bandwidth communication between applications and services. It supports serve\", \"r and client code generation across most popular programming languages and platforms, including .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, Go, and C++. With the first-class support for gRPC in ASP.NET Core 7.0, alongside the existing gRPC tools and libraries for .NET Framework 4.x, it's an excellent alternative to WCF for development teams looking to adopt .NET in their organizations.\\n\\n![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)\\n\\n# Who should use this guide\\n\\nThis guide was written for developers working in .NET Framework or .NET who have previously used WCF, and who are seeking to migrate their applications to a modern RPC environment for .NET Core 3.0 and later versions. More generally, if you are upgrading, or considering upgrading, to .NET 7, and you want to use the built-in gRPC tools, this guide is also useful.\\n\\n# How you can use this guide\\n\\nThis is a short introduction to building gRPC Services in ASP.NET Core 7.0, with particular reference to WCF as an analogous platform. It explains the principles of gRPC, \", \"relating each concept to the equivalent features of WCF, and offers guidance for migrating an existing WCF application to gRPC. It's also useful for developers who have experience with WCF and are looking to learn gRPC to build new services. You can use the sample applications as a template or reference for your own projects, and you are free to copy and reuse code from the book or its samples.\\n\\nFeel free to forward this guide to your team to help ensure a common understanding of these considerations and opportunities. Having everybody working from a common set of terms and underlying principles helps ensure consistent application of architectural patterns and practices.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n- **gRPC website**

id=\\\"page-7-0\\\"></span>Introduction to gRPC for WCF developers\\n\\nHelping machines communicate with each other has been one of the primary preoccupations of the digital age. In particular, there's an ongoing effort to determine the optimal remote communication mechanism that will suit the interoperability demands of the current infrastructure. As you can imagine, that mechanism changes as either the demands or the infrastructure evolves.\\n\\nThe release of .NET Core 3.0 marks a shift in the way that Microsoft delivers remote communication solutions to developers who want to deliver services across a range of platforms. .NET Core and later doesn't offer Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) out of the box but, with the release of ASP.NET Core 3.0, it does provide built-in gRPC functionality.\\n\\ngRPC is a popular framework in the wider software community. It's used by develo\", \"pers across many programming languages for modern RPC scenarios. The community and the ecosystem are vibrant and active. Support for the gRPC protocol is being added to infrastructure components like Kubernetes, service meshes, load balancers, and more. These factors, together with its performance, efficiency, and cross-platform compatibility, make gRPC a natural choice for new apps and WCF apps moving to .NET.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-7-1\\\"></span>History\\n\\nThe fundamental principle of a computer network as nothing more than a group of computers exchanging data with each other to achieve a set of interrelated tasks hasn't changed since its inception. But the complexity, scale, and expectations have grown exponentially.\\n\\nDuring the 1990s, the emphasis was mainly on improving internal networks that used the same language and platforms. TCP/IP became the gold standard for this type of communication.\\n\\nThe focus soon shifted to how best to optimize communication across multiple platforms by promoti\", \"ng a language-agnostic approach. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) provided a structure for loosely coupling a broad collection of services that could be provided to an application.\\n\\nThe development of *web services* occurred when all major platforms could access the internet, but they still couldn't interact with each other. Web services have open standards and protocols, including:\\n\\n\\u2022 XML to tag and code data.\\n\\n- Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to transfer data.\\n- Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) to describe and connect web services to client applications.\\n- Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) to make web services discoverable by other services.\\n\\nSOAP defines the rules by which distributed elements of an application can communicate with each other, even if they're on different platforms. SOAP is based on XML, so it's human-readable. The sacrifice for making SOAP easily understood is size; SOAP messages are larger than messages in comparable protocol\", \"s. SOAP was designed to break monolithic applications into multicomponent form without losing security or control. So WCF was designed to work with that kind of system, unlike gRPC, which began as a distributed system. WCF addressed some of these limitations by developing and documenting proprietary extension protocols for the SOAP stack, but at the cost of a lack of support from other platforms.\\n\\nWindows Communication Foundation is a framework for building services. It was designed in the early 2000s to help developers using early SOA to manage the complexities of working with SOAP. Although it removes the requirement for the developers to write their own SOAP protocols, WCF still uses SOAP to enable interoperability with other systems. WCF was also designed to deliver solutions across multiple protocols (HTTP/1.1, Net.TCP, and so on).\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-8-0\\\"></span>Microservices\\n\\nIn microservice architectures, large applications are built as a collection of smaller modular services. E\", \"ach component does a specific task or process, and components are designed to work interoperably but can be isolated as necessary.\\n\\nAdvantages to microservices include:\\n\\n- Changes and upgrades can be handled independently.\\n- Error handling becomes more efficient because problems can be traced to specific services that are then isolated, rebuilt, tested, and redeployed independently of the other services.\\n- Scalability can be confined to specific instances or services rather than the whole application.\\n- Development can happen across multiple teams, with less friction than occurs when many teams work on a single codebase.\\n\\nThe move towards increasing virtualization, cloud computing, containers, and the Internet of Things has contributed to the ongoing rise of microservices. But microservices aren't without their challenges. The fragmented/decentralized infrastructure put more emphasis on the need for simplicity and speed when communicating between services. This in turn drew attention t\", \"o the sometimes laborious and contorted nature of SOAP.\\n\\nIt was into this environment that gRPC was launched, 10 years after Microsoft first released WCF. Evolved directly from Google's internal infrastructure RPC (Stubby), gRPC was never based on the same standards and protocols that had informed the parameters of many earlier RPCs. And gRPC was only ever based on HTTP/2. That's why it could draw on the new capabilities that advanced transport protocol provided. In particular, bidirectional streaming, binary messaging, and multiplexing.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-9-0\\\"></span>About this guide\\n\\nThis guide covers the key features of gRPC. The early chapters take a high-level look at the main features of WCF and compare them to those of gRPC. It identifies where there are direct correlations between WCF and gRPC and also where gRPC offers an advantage. When there's no correlation between WCF and gRPC, or when gRPC isn't able to offer an equivalent solution to WCF, this guide will suggest workaroun\", \"ds or where to go for more information.\\n\\nUsing a set of sample WCF applications, Chapter 5 is a deep-dive look at converting the main types of WCF service (simple request-reply, one-way, and streaming) to their equivalents in gRPC.\\n\\nThe final section of the book looks at how to get the best from gRPC in practice. This section includes information on using additional tools, like Docker containers or Kubernetes, to take advantage of the efficiency of gRPC. It also includes a detailed look at monitoring with logging, metrics, and distributed tracing.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-9-1\\\"></span>Who this guide is for\\n\\nThis guide was written for developers working in .NET Framework or .NET Core who have used WCF and who are seeking to migrate their applications to a modern RPC environment for .NET Core 3.0 and later versions. The guide might also be useful more generally for developers upgrading or considering upgrading to .NET and who want to use the built-in gRPC tools.\\n\\n**CHAPTER** 2\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-\", \"10-0\\\"></span>gRPC overview\\n\\nAfter looking at the genesis of both Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and gRPC in the last chapter, this chapter considers some of the key features of gRPC and how they compare to WCF.\\n\\nASP.NET Core 3.0 is the first release of ASP.NET that natively supports gRPC as a first-class citizen, with Microsoft teams contributing to the official .NET implementation of gRPC. It's recommended for building distributed applications with .NET that can interoperate with all other major programming languages and frameworks.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-10-1\\\"></span>Key principles\\n\\nAs discussed in chapter 1, Google wanted to use the introduction of HTTP/2 to replace Stubby, its internal, general purpose RPC infrastructure. gRPC, based on Stubby, now can take advantage of standardization and would extend its applicability to mobile computing, the cloud, and the Internet of Things.\\n\\nTo achieve this standardization, the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation \\\\(CNCF\\\\)](https://www.cncf.i\", \"o/) established a set of principles that would govern gRPC. The following list shows the most relevant ones, which are primarily concerned with maximizing accessibility and usability:\\n\\n- **Free and open** All artifacts should be open source, with licensing that doesn't constrain developers from adopting gRPC.\\n- **Coverage and simplicity** gRPC should be available across every popular platform, and simple enough to build on any platform.\\n- **Interoperability and reach** It should be possible to use gRPC on any network, regardless of bandwidth or latency, by using widely available network standards.\\n- **General purpose and performant** The framework should be usable by as broad a range of use-cases as possible, without compromising performance.\\n- **Streaming** The protocol should provide streaming semantics for large datasets or asynchronous messaging.\\n- **Metadata exchange** The protocol allows non-business data, such as authentication tokens, to be handled separately from actual busine\", \"ss data.\\n- **Standardized status codes** The variability of error codes should be reduced to make error handling decisions clearer. Where additional, richer error handling is required, a mechanism should be provided for managing behavior within the metadata exchange.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-11-0\\\"></span>How gRPC approaches RPC\\n\\nWindows Communication Foundation (WCF) and gRPC are both implementations of the *Remote Procedure Call* (RPC) pattern. This pattern aims to make calls to services that run on a different machine, or in a different process, work seamlessly, like method calls in the client application. While the aims of WCF and gRPC are the same, the details of the implementation are quite different.\\n\\nThe following table sets out how the key features of WCF relate to gRPC, and where you can find more detailed explanations.\\n\\n| Features                                    | WCF                                                                             | gRPC                               \", \"                                                                                                                                     |\\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Objective                                   | Separate business<br>code from<br>networking<br>implementation.                 | Separate business code<br>from interface definition<br>and networking<br>implementation.                                                                                |\\n| Define services and messages (chapters 3-4) | Service Contract,<br>Operation<br>Contract, and<br>Data Contract.               | Uses proto file to<br>declare services and<br>messages.                                                                                \", \"                                 |\\n| Language (chapters 3-5)                     | Contracts written<br>in C# or Visual<br>Basic.                                  | Protocol Buffer<br>language.                                                                                                                                            |\\n| Wire format (chapter 3)                     | Configurable,<br>including<br>SOAP/XML, Plain<br>XML, JSON, and<br>.NET Binary. | Protocol Buffer binary<br>format (although it's<br>possible to use other<br>formats).                                                                                   |\\n| Interoperability (chapter 4)                | When using<br>SOAP over HTTP.                                                   | Official support: .NET,<br>Java, Python, JavaScript,<br>C/C++, Go, Rust, Ruby,<br>Swift, Dart, PHP.<br>Unofficial support for<br>other languages from<br>the community. |\\n| Networking (chapter 4)                      | Configured at run\", \"<br>time.

WSDL is generated dynamically by using .NET reflection at run time. Developers can use this metadata to generate clients for those services, potentially in other languages if they're using a platform-neutral binding such as SOAP over HTTP.\\n\\ngRPC uses the Interface Definition Language (IDL) from Protocol Buffers. The Protocol Buffers IDL is a custom, platform-neutral language with an open specification. Developers author .proto files to describe services, along with their inputs and outputs. These .proto files can then be used to generate language- or platform-specific stubs for cl\", \"ients and servers, allowing multiple different platforms to communicate. By sharing .proto files, teams can generate code to use each others' services, without needing to take a code dependency.\\n\\nOne of the advantages of the Protobuf IDL is that as a custom language, it enables gRPC to be completely language and platform agnostic, not favoring any technology over another.\\n\\nThe Protobuf IDL is also designed for humans to both read and write, whereas WSDL is intended as a machine-readable/writable format. Changing the WSDL of a WCF service typically requires changing the service, running the service, and regenerating the WSDL file from the server. By contrast, with a .proto file, changes are simple to apply with a text editor, and automatically flow through the generated code. Visual Studio 2022 builds .proto files in the background when they are saved. With other editors, such as VS Code, the changes are applied when the project is built.\\n\\nWhen compared with XML, and particularly SOAP, \", \"messages encoded by using Protobuf have many advantages. Protobuf messages tend to be smaller than the same data serialized as SOAP XML, and encoding, decoding, and transmitting them over a network can be faster.\\n\\nThe potential disadvantage of Protobuf compared to SOAP is that, because the messages aren't readable by humans, additional tooling is required to debug message content.\\n\\n#### **Tip**\\n\\ngRPC *does* support server reflection for dynamically accessing services without pre-compiled stubs, although it's intended more for general-purpose tools than application-specific clients. For more information, see [GRPC Server Reflection Protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md) on GitHub.\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nWCF's binary format, used with the NetTCP binding, is much closer to Protobuf in terms of compactness and performance. But NetTCP is only usable between .NET clients and servers, whereas Protobuf is a cross-platform solution.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-13-0\\\"></span>\", \"Network protocols\\n\\nUnlike Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), gRPC uses HTTP/2 as a base for its networking. This protocol offers significant advantages over WCF and SOAP, which operate only on HTTP/1.1. For developers wanting to use gRPC, given that there's no alternative to HTTP/2, it would seem to be the ideal moment to explore HTTP/2 in more detail and identify additional benefits of using gRPC.\\n\\nHTTP/2, released by Internet Engineering Task Force in 2015, was derived from the experimental SPDY protocol, which was already being used by Google. It was specifically designed to be more efficient, faster, and more secure than HTTP/1.1.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-13-1\\\"></span>**Key features of HTTP/2**\\n\\nThis list shows some of the key features and advantages of HTTP/2:\\n\\n### **Binary protocol**\\n\\nRequest/response cycles no longer need text commands. This activity simplifies and speeds up the implementation of commands. Specifically, parsing data is faster and uses less memory, network latency \", \"is reduced with obvious related improvements to speed, and there's an overall better use of network resources.\\n\\n#### **Streams**\\n\\nStreams allow you to create long-lived connections between sender and receiver, over which multiple messages or frames can be sent asynchronously. Multiple streams can operate independently over a single HTTP/2 connection.\\n\\n### **Request multiplexing over a single TCP connection**\\n\\nThis feature is one of the most important innovations of HTTP/2. Because it allows multiple parallel requests for data, it's now possible to download web files concurrently from a single server. Websites load faster, and the need for optimization is reduced. Head-of-line (HOL) blocking, where responses\\n\\nthat are ready must wait to be sent until an earlier request is completed, is also mitigated (although HOL blocking can still occur at the TCP-transport level).\\n\\n#### **Net.TCP-like performance, cross-platform**\\n\\nFundamentally, the combination of gRPC and HTTP/2 offers developers a\", \"t least the equivalent speed and efficiency of Net.TCP bindings for WCF, and in some cases even greater speed and efficiency. But, unlike Net.TCP, gRPC over HTTP/2 isn't constrained to .NET applications.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-14-0\\\"></span>Why we recommend gRPC for WCF developers\\n\\nBefore we dive deeply into the language and techniques of gRPC, it's worth discussing why gRPC is the right solution for Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) developers who want to migrate to .NET.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-14-1\\\"></span>**Similarity to WCF**\\n\\nAlthough the implementation and approach are different for gRPC, the experience of developing and consuming services with gRPC should be intuitive for WCF developers. The underlying goal is the same: make it possible to code as though the client and server are on the same platform, without needing to worry about networking.\\n\\nBoth platforms share the principle of declaring and then implementing an interface, even though the process for declaring that interface is d\", \"ifferent. And as you'll see in [chapter 5,](#page-43-0) the different types of RPC calls that gRPC supports map well to the bindings available to WCF services.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-14-2\\\"></span>**Benefits of gRPC**\\n\\ngRPC stands above other solutions for the following reasons.\\n\\n#### **Performance**\\n\\nUsing HTTP/2 rather than HTTP/1.1 removes the requirement for human-readable messages and instead uses the smaller, faster binary protocol. This is more efficient for computers to parse. HTTP/2 also supports multiplexing requests over a single connection. This support enables responses to be sent as soon as they're ready without the need to wait in a queue. (In HTTP/1.1, this issue is known as \\\"head-of-line (HOL) blocking.\\\") You need fewer resources when using gRPC, which makes it a good solution to use for mobile devices and over slower networks.\\n\\n#### **Interoperability**\\n\\nThere are gRPC tools and libraries for all major programming languages and platforms, including .NET, Java, Python, Go, C\", \"++, Node.js, Swift, Dart, Ruby, and PHP. Thanks to the Protocol Buffers binary wire format and the efficient code generation for each platform, developers can build performant apps while still enjoying full cross-platform support.\\n\\n#### **Usability and productivity**\\n\\ngRPC is a comprehensive RPC solution. It works consistently across multiple languages and platforms. It also provides excellent tooling, with much of the necessary boilerplate code automatically generated. So more developer time is freed up to focus on business logic.\\n\\n#### **Streaming**\\n\\ngRPC has full bidirectional streaming, which provides similar functionality to WCF's full-duplex services. gRPC streaming can operate over regular internet connections, load balancers, and service meshes.\\n\\n#### **Deadline/timeouts and cancellation**\\n\\ngRPC allows clients to specify a maximum time for an RPC to finish. If the specified deadline is exceeded, the server can cancel the operation independently of the client. Deadlines and canc\", \"ellations can be propagated through further gRPC calls to help enforce resource usage limits. Clients can also stop operations when a deadline is exceeded, or earlier if necessary (for example, because of a user interaction).\\n\\n#### **Security**\\n\\ngRPC is implicitly secure when it's using HTTP/2 over a TLS end-to-end encrypted connection. Support for client certificate authentication (see [chapter 6\\\\)](#page-74-0) further increases security and trust between client and server.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-15-0\\\"></span>**Comparison with CoreWCF**\\n\\nA notable alternative to gRPC for replacing WCF services when migrating to .NET is [CoreWCF.](https://github.com/corewcf/corewcf) Both gRPC and CoreWCF are Microsoft endorsed paths forward for WCF applications and each comes with its own benefits and drawbacks.\\n\\nCoreWCF is a community-owned .NET Foundation project supported by Microsoft that implements WCF server APIs for .NET. CoreWCF is an effort to allow existing WCF services to work with minimal change\", \"s on .NET. Your Data Contracts for WCF are unchanged with CoreWCF, and it supports many of the bindings and APIs from WCF. The main differences are around the patterns for starting WCF services, and not all configuration options are available (some configuration must now be done in code).\\n\\nServices and interfaces can often migrate with few changes. Because of this, a key benefit of CoreWCF is its very high compatibility with WCF. Where changes have been made, they are to adapt to the programming style of modern .NET, for example hosting now through ASP.NET Core, and APIs now use the Task based async patterns usable with await rather than the older BeginXXX / EndXXX pattern.\\n\\nOn the other hand, gRPC is a modern remote communication solution with a number of features, as discussed previously. Benefits of using gRPC include better interoperability across languages, its relatively simple modern API, and a broad community ecosystem.\\n\\nWhen deciding whether to use CoreWCF or gRPC to migrate a\", \" WCF application to .NET, CoreWCF is typically a better fit if the goal is to migrate the application with minimal changes whereas gRPC may be a better fit if the goal is to modernize the application while retargeting to .NET. The remainder of this guide focuses on that modernization with gRPC.\\n\\n**CHAPTER** 3\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-17-0\\\"></span>Protocol buffers\\n\\ngRPC services send and receive data as *Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) messages*, similar to data contracts in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). Protobuf is an efficient way of serializing structured data for machines to read and write, without the overhead that human-readable formats like XML or JSON incur.\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-17-1\\\"></span>This chapter covers how Protobuf works, and how to define your own Protobuf messages.\\n\\n# How Protobuf works\\n\\nMost .NET object serialization techniques, including WCF's data contracts, work by using reflection to analyze the object structure at run time. By contrast, most Protobuf libraries require \", \"you to define the structure up front by using a dedicated language (*Protocol Buffer Language*) in a .proto file. A compiler then uses this file to generate code for any of the supported platforms. Supported platforms include .NET, Java, C/C++, JavaScript, and many more.\\n\\nThe Protobuf compiler, protoc, is maintained by Google, although alternative implementations are available. The generated code is efficient and optimized for fast serialization and deserialization of data.\\n\\nThe Protobuf wire format is a binary encoding. It uses some clever tricks to minimize the number of bytes used to represent messages. Knowledge of the binary encoding format isn't necessary to use Protobuf. But if you're interested, you can learn more about it on [the Protocol Buffers website.](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding)\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-17-2\\\"></span>Protobuf messages\\n\\nThis section covers how to declare Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) messages in .proto files. It explains the fundamen\", \"tal concepts of field numbers and types, and it looks at the C# code that the protoc compiler generates.\\n\\nThe rest of the chapter will look in more detail at how different types of data are represented in Protobuf.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-17-3\\\"></span>**Declaring a message**\\n\\nIn Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), a Stock class for a stock market trading application might be defined like the following example:\\n\\n**namespace** TraderSys;\\n\\n```\\n[DataContract]\\npublic class Stock\\n{\\n [DataMember]\\n public int Id { get; set; }\\n [DataMember]\\n public string Symbol { get; set; }\\n [DataMember]\\n public string DisplayName { get; set; }\\n [DataMember]\\n public int MarketId { get; set; }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo implement the equivalent class in Protobuf, you must declare it in the .proto file. The protoc compiler will then generate the .NET class as part of the build process.\\n\\n```\\nsyntax = \\\"proto3\\\";\\noption csharp_namespace = \\\"TraderSys\\\";\\nmessage Stock {\\n int32 id = 1;\\n string symbol = 2;\\n string display_name = 3;\\n int32\", \" market_id = 4;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe first line declares the syntax version being used. Version 3 of the language was released in 2016. It's the version that we recommend for gRPC services.\\n\\nThe option csharp\\\\_namespace line specifies the namespace to be used for the generated C# types. This option will be ignored when the .proto file is compiled for other languages. Protobuf files often contain language-specific options for several languages.\\n\\nThe Stock message definition specifies four fields. Each has a type, a name, and a field number.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-18-0\\\"></span>**Field numbers**\\n\\nField numbers are an important part of Protobuf. They're used to identify fields in the binary encoded data, which means they can't change from version to version of your service. The advantage is that backward compatibility and forward compatibility are possible. Clients and services will ignore field numbers that they don't know about, as long as the possibility of missing values is handled.\\n\\nIn the binary f\", \"ormat, the field number is combined with a type identifier. Field numbers from 1 to 15 can be encoded with their type as a single byte. Numbers from 16 to 2,047 take 2 bytes. You can go higher if you need more than 2,047 fields on a message for any reason. The single-byte identifiers for field numbers 1 to 15 offer better performance, so you should use them for the most basic, frequently used fields.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-19-0\\\"></span>**Types**\\n\\nThe type declarations are using Protobuf's native scalar data types, which are discussed in more detail in [the next section](#page-19-2). The rest of this chapter will cover Protobuf's built-in types and show how they relate to common .NET types.\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nProtobuf doesn't natively support a decimal type, so double is used instead. For applications that require full decimal precision, refer to the [section on decimals](#page-22-0) in the next part of this chapter.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-19-1\\\"></span>**The generated code**\\n\\nWhen you build your ap\", \"plication, Protobuf creates classes for each of your messages, mapping its native types to C# types. The generated Stock type would have the following signature:\\n\\n```\\npublic class Stock\\n{\\n public int Id { get; set; }\\n public string Symbol { get; set; }\\n public string DisplayName { get; set; }\\n public int MarketId { get; set; }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe actual code that's generated is far more complicated than this. The reason is that each class contains all the code necessary to serialize and deserialize itself to the binary wire format.\\n\\n#### **Property names**\\n\\nNote that the Protobuf compiler applied PascalCase to the property names, although they were snake\\\\_case in the .proto file. The [Protobuf style guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style) recommends using snake\\\\_case in your message definitions so that the code generation for other platforms produces the expected case for their conventions.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-19-2\\\"></span>Protobuf scalar data types\\n\\nProtocol Buffer (Pro\", \"tobuf) supports a range of native scalar value types. The following table lists them all with their equivalent C# type:\\n\\n| Protobuf type | C# type | Notes |\\n|---------------|---------|-------|\\n| double        | double  |       |\\n| Float         | float   |       |\\n| int32         | int     | 1     |\\n| int64         | long    | 1     |\\n| uint32        | uint    |       |\\n| uint64        | ulong   |       |\\n\\n| Protobuf type | C# type    | Notes |\\n|---------------|------------|-------|\\n| sint32        | int        | 1     |\\n| sint64        | long       | 1     |\\n| fixed32       | uint       | 2     |\\n| fixed64       | ulong      | 2     |\\n| sfixed32      | int        | 2     |\\n| sfixed64      | long       | 2     |\\n| bool          | bool       |       |\\n| string        | string     | 3     |\\n| bytes         | ByteString | 4     |\\n\\n#### Notes:\\n\\n- 1. The standard encoding for int32 and int64 is inefficient when you're working with signed values. If your field is likely to contain negative n\", \"umbers, use sint32 or sint64 instead. These types map to the C# int and long types, respectively.\\n- 2. The fixed fields always use the same number of bytes no matter what the value is. This behavior makes serialization and deserialization faster for larger values.\\n- 3. Protobuf strings are UTF-8 (or 7-bit ASCII) encoded. The encoded length can't be greater than 232.\\n- 4. The Protobuf runtime provides a ByteString type that maps easily to and from C# byte[] arrays.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-20-0\\\"></span>**Other .NET primitive types**\\n\\n#### **Dates and times**\\n\\nThe native scalar types don't provide for date and time values, equivalent to C#'s [DateTimeOffset,](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.datetimeoffset)  [DateTime,](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.datetime) and [TimeSpan](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.timespan). You can specify these types by using some of Google's \\\"Well Known Types\\\" extensions. These extensions provide code generation and runtime sup\", \"port for complex field types across the supported platforms.\\n\\nThe following table shows the date and time types:\\n\\n| C# type        | Protobuf well-known type  |  |\\n|----------------|---------------------------|--|\\n| DateTimeOffset | google.protobuf.Timestamp |  |\\n| DateTime       | google.protobuf.Timestamp |  |\\n| TimeSpan       | google.protobuf.Duration  |  |\\n\\n```\\nsyntax = \\\"proto3\\\"\\nimport \\\"google/protobuf/duration.proto\\\"; \\nimport \\\"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto\\\";\\nmessage Meeting {\\n```\\n\\n```\\n string subject = 1;\\n google.protobuf.Timestamp time = 2;\\n google.protobuf.Duration duration = 3;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe generated properties in the C# class aren't the .NET date and time types. The properties use the Timestamp and Duration classes in the Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes namespace. These classes provide methods for converting to and from DateTimeOffset, DateTime, and TimeSpan.\\n\\n```\\n// Create Timestamp and Duration from .NET DateTimeOffset and TimeSpan\\nvar meeting = new Meeting\\n{\\n Time = Timesta\", \"mp.FromDateTimeOffset(meetingTime), // also FromDateTime()\\n Duration = Duration.FromTimeSpan(meetingLength)\\n};\\n// Convert Timestamp and Duration to .NET DateTimeOffset and TimeSpan\\nDateTimeOffset time = meeting.Time.ToDateTimeOffset();\\nTimeSpan? duration = meeting.Duration?.ToTimeSpan();\\n```\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nThe Timestamp type works with UTC times. DateTimeOffset values always have an offset of zero, and the DateTime.Kind property is always DateTimeKind.Utc.\\n\\n#### **System.Guid**\\n\\nProtobuf doesn't directly support the [Guid](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.guid) type, known as UUID on other platforms. There's no wellknown type for it.\\n\\nThe best approach is to handle Guid values as a string field, by using the standard 8-4-4-4-12 hexadecimal format (for example, 45a9fda3-bd01-47a9-8460-c1cd7484b0b3). All languages and platforms can parse that format.\\n\\nDon't use a bytes field for Guid values. Problems with *endianness* [\\\\(Wikipedia definition\\\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\", \"Endianness) can result in erratic behavior when Protobuf is interacting with other platforms, such as Java.\\n\\n### **Nullable types**\\n\\nThe Protobuf code generation for C# uses the native types, such as int for int32. So the values are always included and can't be null.\\n\\nFor values that require explicit null, such as using int? in your C# code, Protobuf's \\\"Well Known Types\\\" include wrappers that are compiled to nullable C# types. To use them, import wrappers.proto into your .proto file, like this:\\n\\n```\\nsyntax = \\\"proto3\\\"\\nimport \\\"google/protobuf/wrappers.proto\\\";\\nmessage Person {\\n```\\n\\n```\\n ...\\n google.protobuf.Int32Value age = 5;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nProtobuf will use the simple T? (for example, int?) for the generated message property.\\n\\nThe following table shows the complete list of wrapper types with their equivalent C# type:\\n\\n| C# type | Well Known Type wrapper     |\\n|---------|-----------------------------|\\n| double? | google.protobuf.DoubleValue |\\n| float?  | google.protobuf.FloatValue  |\\n| int?    |\", \" google.protobuf.Int32Value  |\\n| long?   | google.protobuf.Int64Value  |\\n| uint?   | google.protobuf.UInt32Value |\\n| ulong?  | google.protobuf.UInt64Value |\\n\\nThe well-known types Timestamp and Duration are represented in .NET as classes. In C# 8 and beyond, you can use nullable reference types. But it's important to check for null on properties of those types when you're converting to DateTimeOffset or TimeSpan.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-22-0\\\"></span>**Decimals**\\n\\nProtobuf doesn't natively support the .NET decimal type, just double and float. There's an ongoing discussion in the Protobuf project about the possibility of adding a standard Decimal type to the wellknown types, with platform support for languages and frameworks that support it. Nothing has been implemented yet.\\n\\nIt's possible to create a message definition to represent the decimal type that would work for safe serialization between .NET clients and servers. But developers on other platforms would have to understand the format bei\", \"ng used and implement their own handling for it.\\n\\n# **Creating a custom decimal type for Protobuf**\\n\\nA simple implementation might be similar to the nonstandard Money type that some Google APIs use, without the currency field.\\n\\n```\\npackage CustomTypes;\\n// Example: 12345.6789 -> { units = 12345, nanos = 678900000 }\\nmessage DecimalValue {\\n // Whole units part of the amount\\n int64 units = 1;\\n // Nano units of the amount (10^-9)\\n // Must be same sign as units\\n sfixed32 nanos = 2;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe nanos field represents values from 0.999\\\\_999\\\\_999 to -0.999\\\\_999\\\\_999. For example, the decimal value 1.5m would be represented as { units = 1, nanos = 500\\\\_000\\\\_000 }. This is why the nanos field in this example uses the sfixed32 type, which encodes more efficiently than int32 for larger values. If the units field is negative, the nanos field should also be negative.\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nThere are multiple other algorithms for encoding decimal values as byte strings, but this message is easier to understan\", \"d than any of them. The values are not affected by endianness on different platforms.\\n\\nConversion between this type and the BCL decimal type might be implemented in C# like this:\\n\\n```\\nnamespace CustomTypes;\\npublic partial class DecimalValue\\n{\\n private const decimal NanoFactor = 1_000_000_000;\\n public DecimalValue(long units, int nanos)\\n {\\n Units = units;\\n Nanos = nanos;\\n }\\n public static implicit operator decimal(CustomTypes.DecimalValue grpcDecimal)\\n {\\n return grpcDecimal.Units + grpcDecimal.Nanos / NanoFactor;\\n }\\n public static implicit operator CustomTypes.DecimalValue(decimal value)\\n {\\n var units = decimal.ToInt64(value);\\n var nanos = decimal.ToInt32((value - units) * NanoFactor);\\n return new CustomTypes.DecimalValue(units, nanos);\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Important**\\n\\nWhenever you use custom message types like this, you *must* document them with comments in .proto. Other developers can then implement conversion to and from the equivalent type in their own language or framework.\\n\\n# <span i\", \"d=\\\"page-23-0\\\"></span>Protobuf nested types\\n\\nJust as C# allows you to declare classes inside other classes, Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) allows you to nest message definitions within other messages. The following example shows how to create nested message types:\\n\\n```\\nmessage Outer {\\n message Inner {\\n string text = 1;\\n }\\n```\\n\\n```\\n Inner inner = 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the generated C# code, the Inner type will be declared in a nested static Types class within the HelloRequest class:\\n\\n```\\nvar inner = new Outer.Types.Inner { Text = \\\"Hello\\\" };\\n```\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-24-0\\\"></span>Repeated fields for lists and arrays\\n\\nYou specify lists in Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) by using the repeated prefix keyword. The following example shows how to create a list:\\n\\n```\\nmessage Person {\\n // Other fields elided\\n repeated string aliases = 8;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the generated code, repeated fields are represented by read-only properties of the [Google.Protobuf.Collections.RepeatedField<T>](https://developers.google.cn/protocol-buffe\", \"rs/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/collections/repeated-field-t-) type rather than any of the built-in .NET collection types. This type implements all the standard .NET collection interfaces, such as [IList](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ilist-1) and [IEnumerable.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1) So you can use LINQ queries or convert it to an array or a list easily.\\n\\nThe RepeatedField<T> type includes the code required to serialize and deserialize the list to the binary wire format.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-24-1\\\"></span>Protobuf reserved fields\\n\\nThe backward-compatibility guarantees in Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) rely on field numbers always representing the same data item. If a field is removed from a message in a new version of the service, that field number should never be reused. You can enforce this behavior by using the reserved keyword.\\n\\nIf the displayName and marketId fields were removed fro\", \"m the Stock message defined earlier, their field numbers should be reserved as in the following example.\\n\\n```\\nsyntax \\\"proto3\\\";\\nmessage Stock {\\n reserved 3, 4;\\n int32 id = 1;\\n string symbol = 2;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can also use the reserved keyword as a placeholder for fields that might be added in the future. You can express contiguous field numbers as a range by using the to keyword.\\n\\n```\\nsyntax \\\"proto3\\\";\\nmessage Info {\\n```\\n\\n```\\n reserved 2, 9 to 11, 15;\\n // ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-25-0\\\"></span>Protobuf Any and Oneof fields for variant types\\n\\nHandling dynamic property types (that is, properties of type object) in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is complicated. For example, you must specify serializers and provide [KnownType](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.knowntypeattribute) attributes.\\n\\nProtocol Buffer (Protobuf) provides two simpler options for dealing with values that might be of more than one type. The Any type can represent any known Protobuf\", \" message type. And you can use the oneof keyword to specify that only one of a range of fields can be set in any message.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-25-1\\\"></span>**Any**\\n\\nAny is one of Protobuf's \\\"well-known types\\\": a collection of useful, reusable message types with implementations in all supported languages. To use the Any type, you must import the google/protobuf/any.proto definition.\\n\\n```\\nsyntax = \\\"proto3\\\";\\nimport \\\"google/protobuf/any.proto\\\";\\nmessage Stock {\\n // Stock-specific data\\n}\\nmessage Currency {\\n // Currency-specific data\\n}\\nmessage ChangeNotification {\\n int32 id = 1;\\n google.protobuf.Any instrument = 2;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the C# code, the Any class provides methods for setting the field, extracting the message, and checking the type.\\n\\n```\\npublic void FormatChangeNotification(ChangeNotification change)\\n{\\n if (change.Instrument.Is(Stock.Descriptor))\\n {\\n FormatStock(change.Instrument.Unpack<Stock>());\\n }\\n else if (change.Instrument.Is(Currency.Descriptor))\\n {\\n FormatCurrency(change.Instrument.Un\", \"pack<Currency>());\\n }\\n else\\n {\\n throw new ArgumentException(\\\"Unknown instrument type\\\");\\n```\\n\\n```\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nProtobuf's internal reflection code uses the Descriptor static field on each generated type to resolve Any field types. There's also a TryUnpack<T> method, but that creates an uninitialized instance of T even when it fails. It's better to use the Is method as shown earlier.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-26-0\\\"></span>**Oneof**\\n\\nOneof fields are a language feature: the compiler handles the oneof keyword when it generates the message class. Using oneof to specify the ChangeNotification message might look like this:\\n\\n```\\nmessage Stock {\\n // Stock-specific data\\n}\\nmessage Currency {\\n // Currency-specific data\\n}\\nmessage ChangeNotification {\\n int32 id = 1;\\n oneof instrument {\\n Stock stock = 2;\\n Currency currency = 3;\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFields within the oneof set must have unique field numbers in the overall message declaration.\\n\\nWhen you use oneof, the generated C# code includes an enum that specifies which\", \" of the fields has been set. You can test the enum to find which field is set. Fields that aren't set return null or the default value, rather than throwing an exception.\\n\\n```\\npublic void FormatChangeNotification(ChangeNotification change)\\n{\\n switch (change.InstrumentCase)\\n {\\n case ChangeNotification.InstrumentOneofCase.None:\\n return;\\n case ChangeNotification.InstrumentOneofCase.Stock:\\n FormatStock(change.Stock);\\n break;\\n case ChangeNotification.InstrumentOneofCase.Currency:\\n FormatCurrency(change.Currency);\\n break;\\n default:\\n throw new ArgumentException(\\\"Unknown instrument type\\\");\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSetting any field that's part of a oneof set will automatically clear any other fields in the set. You can't use repeated with oneof. Instead, you can create a nested message with either the repeated field or the oneof set to work around this limitation.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-27-0\\\"></span>Protobuf enumerations\\n\\nProtobuf supports enumeration types. You saw this support in the previous section, where an \", \"enum was used to determine the type of a Oneof field. You can define your own enumeration types, and Protobuf will compile them to C# enum types.\\n\\nBecause you can use Protobuf with various languages, the naming conventions for enumerations are different from the C# conventions. However, the code generator converts the names to the traditional C# case. If the Pascal-case equivalent of the field name starts with the enumeration name, then it's removed.\\n\\nFor example, in the following Protobuf enumeration, the fields are prefixed with ACCOUNT\\\\_STATUS. This prefix is equivalent to the Pascal-case enum name, AccountStatus.\\n\\n```\\nenum AccountStatus {\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_UNKNOWN = 0;\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_PENDING = 1;\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_ACTIVE = 2;\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_SUSPENDED = 3;\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_CLOSED = 4;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe generator creates a C# enum equivalent to the following code:\\n\\n```\\npublic enum AccountStatus\\n{\\n Unknown = 0,\\n Pending = 1,\\n Active = 2,\\n Suspended = 3,\\n Closed = 4\\n}\\n```\\n\\nProtobuf enumeration d\", \"efinitions *must* have a zero constant as their first field. As in C#, you can declare multiple fields with the same value. But you must explicitly enable this option by using the allow\\\\_alias option in the enum:\\n\\n```\\nenum AccountStatus {\\n option allow_alias = true;\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_UNKNOWN = 0;\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_PENDING = 1;\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_ACTIVE = 2;\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_SUSPENDED = 3;\\n ACCOUNT_STATUS_CLOSED = 4;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can declare enumerations at the top level in a .proto file, or nested within a message definition. Nested enumerations\\u2014like nested messages\\u2014will be declared within the .Types static class in the generated message class.\\n\\nThere's no way to apply the [\\\\[Flags\\\\]](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.flagsattribute) attribute to a Protobuf-generated enum, and Protobuf doesn't understand bitwise enum combinations. Look at the following example:\\n\\n```\\nenum Region {\\n REGION_NONE = 0;\\n```\\n\\n```\\n REGION_NORTH_AMERICA = 1;\\n REGION_SOUTH_AMERICA = 2;\\n REGION_EMEA = 4;\\n REGION\", \"_APAC = 8;\\n}\\nmessage Product {\\n Region available_in = 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you set product.AvailableIn to Region.NorthAmerica | Region.SouthAmerica, it's serialized as the integer value 3. When a client or server tries to deserialize the value, it won't find a match in the enum definition for 3. The result will be Region.None.\\n\\nThe best way to work with multiple enum values in Protobuf is to use a repeated field of the enum type.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-28-0\\\"></span>Protobuf maps for dictionaries\\n\\nIt's important to be able to represent arbitrary collections of named values in messages. In .NET, this activity is commonly handled through dictionary types. The equivalent of the .NET [IDictionary<TKey,TValue>](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.idictionary-2) type in Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) is the map<key\\\\_type, value\\\\_type> type. This section shows how to declare a map type in Protobuf, and how to use the generated code.\\n\\n```\\nmessage StockPrices {\\n map<string, double> p\", \"rices = 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the generated code, map fields are represented by read-only properties of the [Google.Protobuf.Collections.MapField<TKey, TValue>](https://developers.google.cn/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/collections/map-field-t-key-t-value-) type. This type implements the standard .NET collection interfaces, including [IDictionary<TKey,TValue>.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.idictionary-2)\\n\\nMap fields can't be directly repeated in a message definition. But you can create a nested message that contains a map and use repeated on the message type, as in the following example:\\n\\n```\\nmessage Order {\\n message Attributes {\\n map<string, string> values = 1;\\n }\\n repeated Attributes attributes = 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-28-1\\\"></span>**Using MapField properties in code**\\n\\nThe MapField properties generated from map fields are read-only, and will never be null. To set a map property, use the Add(IDictionary<TKey,TValue> values\", \") method on the empty MapField property to copy values from any .NET dictionary.\\n\\n```\\npublic Order CreateOrder(Dictionary<string, string> attributes)\\n{\\n var order = new Order();\\n order.Attributes.Add(attributes);\\n```\\n\\n**return** order;\\n\\n}\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-29-0\\\"></span>**Further reading**\\n\\nFor more information about Protobuf, see the official [Protobuf documentation.](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-30-0\\\"></span>Comparing WCF to gRPC\\n\\nThe previous chapter gave you a good look at Protobuf and how gRPC handles messages. Before you work through a detailed conversion from Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to gRPC, it's important to know how the features available in WCF are handled in gRPC and what workarounds you can use when there's no gRPC equivalent. In particular, this chapter will cover the following subjects:\\n\\n- Operations and methods\\n- Bindings and transports\\n- RPC types\\n- Metadata\\n- Error handling\\n- WS-\\\\* protocols\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"\", \"page-30-1\\\"></span>gRPC example\\n\\nWhen you create a new ASP.NET Core 7.0 gRPC project from Visual Studio 2022 or the command line, the gRPC equivalent of \\\"Hello World\\\" is generated for you. It consists of a greeter.proto file that defines the service and its messages, and a GreeterService.cs file with an implementation of the service.\\n\\n```\\nsyntax = \\\"proto3\\\";\\noption csharp_namespace = \\\"HelloGrpc\\\";\\npackage Greet;\\n// The greeting service definition.\\nservice Greeter {\\n // Sends a greeting\\n rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);\\n}\\n// The request message that contains the user's name.\\nmessage HelloRequest {\\n string name = 1;\\n}\\n// The response message that contains the greetings.\\nmessage HelloReply {\\n string message = 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\nnamespace HelloGrpc;\\npublic class GreeterService : Greeter.GreeterBase\\n{\\n private readonly ILogger<GreeterService> _logger;\\n public GreeterService(ILogger<GreeterService> logger)\\n {\\n _logger = logger;\\n }\\n public override Task<HelloReply> SayHello(HelloRequ\", \"est request, ServerCallContext \\ncontext)\\n {\\n return Task.FromResult(new HelloReply\\n {\\n Message = \\\"Hello \\\" + request.Name\\n });\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis chapter will refer to this example code when explaining different concepts and features of gRPC.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-31-0\\\"></span>WCF endpoints and gRPC methods\\n\\nIn Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), when you're writing your application code, you use one of the following methods:\\n\\n- You write the application code in a class and decorate methods with the [OperationContract](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.operationcontractattribute) attribute.\\n- You declare an interface for the service and add [OperationContract](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.operationcontractattribute) attributes to the interface.\\n\\nFor example, the WCF equivalent of the greet.proto Greeter service might be written as follows:\\n\\n```\\n[ServiceContract]\\npublic interface IGreeterService\\n{\\n [OperationContract]\\n string SayHello(stri\", \"ng name);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nChapter 3 showed that Protobuf message definitions are used to generate data classes. Service and method declarations are used to generate base classes that you inherit from to implement the service. You just declare the methods to be implemented in the .proto file, and the compiler generates a base class with virtual methods that you must override.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-31-1\\\"></span>**OperationContract properties**\\n\\nThe [OperationContract](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.operationcontractattribute) attribute has properties to control or refine how it works. gRPC methods don't offer this type of control. The following table lists those OperationContract properties and describes how the functionality that they specify is (or isn't) dealt with in gRPC:\\n\\n| OperationContract property | gRPC                                                                                                      |\\n|----------------------------|------------------------------\", \"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Action                     | A URI identifies the operation. gRPC uses the name of<br>package, service, and rpc from the .proto file.  |\\n| AsyncPattern               | All gRPC service methods return Task objects.                                                             |\\n| IsInitiating               | See the paragraph after this table.                                                                       |\\n| IsOneWay                   | One-way gRPC methods return Empty results or use client<br>streaming.                                     |\\n| IsTerminating              | See the paragraph after this table.                                                                       |\\n| Name                       | This property is SOAP related and has no meaning in gRPC.                                                 |\\n| ProtectionLevel            | There's no message encryption.

The IsTerminating property causes the server to close the session after an operation is called (or the client, if the property is used on a callback client). In gRPC, streams are created by single methods and closed explicitly. See [gRPC streaming.](#page-35-0)\\n\\nFor more information on gRPC security and encryption, see [chapter 6.](#page-74-0)\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-32-0\\\"></span>WCF bindings and transports\\n\\nWindows Communication Foundation (WCF) has built-in *bindings* that specify different network protocols, wire formats, and other implementation details. gRPC effectively has just o\", \"ne network protocol and one wire format. (Technically you *can* customize the wire format, but that's beyond the scope of this book.) You're likely to discover that gRPC offers the best solution in most cases.\\n\\nWhat follows is a short discussion about the most relevant WCF bindings and how they compare to their equivalents in gRPC.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-32-1\\\"></span>**NetTCP**\\n\\nWCF's NetTCP binding allows for persistent connections, small messages, and two-way messaging. But it works only between .NET clients and servers. gRPC allows the same functionality but is supported across multiple programming languages and platforms.\\n\\ngRPC has many features of WCF's NetTCP binding, but they're not always implemented in the same way. For example, in WCF, encryption is controlled through configuration and handled in the framework. In gRPC, encryption is achieved at the connection level through HTTP/2 over TLS.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-33-0\\\"></span>**HTTP**\\n\\nThe WCF binding called BasicHttpBinding is usual\", \"ly text-based and uses SOAP as the wire format. It's slow compared to the NetTCP binding. It's used to provide cross-platform interoperability, or connection over internet infrastructure.\\n\\nThe equivalent in gRPC uses HTTP/2 as the underlying transport layer with the binary Protobuf wire format for messages. So it can offer performance at the NetTCP service level and full cross-platform interoperability with all modern programming languages and frameworks.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-33-1\\\"></span>**Named pipes**\\n\\nWCF provided a *named pipes* binding for communication between processes on the same physical machine. ASP.NET Core gRPC doesn't support named pipes. For inter-process communication (IPC) using gRPC instead supports Unix domain sockets. Unix domain sockets are supported on Linux and [modern versions of Windows.](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/)\\n\\nFor more information, see [Inter-process communication with gRPC.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/\", \"grpc/interprocess)\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-33-2\\\"></span>**MSMQ**\\n\\nMSMQ is a proprietary Windows message queue. WCF's binding to MSMQ enables \\\"fire and forget\\\" requests from clients that might be processed at any time in the future. gRPC doesn't natively provide any message queue functionality.\\n\\nThe best alternative is to directly use a messaging system like Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, or Kafka. You can implement this functionality with the client placing messages directly onto the queue, or a gRPC client streaming service that enqueues the messages.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-33-3\\\"></span>**WebHttpBinding**\\n\\nWebHttpBinding (also known as WCF REST), with the WebGet and WebInvoke attributes, enabled you to develop RESTful APIs that could speak JSON at a time when this behavior was less common. If you have a RESTful API built with WCF REST, consider migrating it to a regular ASP.NET Core MVC Web API application. This migration would provide the same functionality as a conversion to gRPC.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"\", \"page-33-4\\\"></span>Types of RPC\\n\\nAs a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) developer, you're probably used to dealing with the following types of remote procedure call (RPC):\\n\\n- Request/reply\\n- Duplex:\\n  - One-way duplex with session\\n  - Full duplex with session\\n- One-way\\n\\nIt's possible to map these RPC types fairly naturally to existing gRPC concepts. This chapter will look at each of these areas in turn. [Chapter 5](#page-43-0) will explore similar examples in greater depth.\\n\\n| WCF                                                              | gRPC                    |\\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\\n| Regular request/reply                                            | Unary                   |\\n| Duplex service with session using a client<br>callback interface | Server streaming        |\\n| Full duplex service with session                                 | Bidirectional streaming |\\n| One-way operations                     \", \"                          | Client streaming        |\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-34-0\\\"></span>**Request/reply**\\n\\nFor simple request/reply methods that take and return small amounts of data, use the simplest gRPC pattern, the unary RPC.\\n\\n```\\nservice Things {\\n rpc Get(GetThingRequest) returns (GetThingResponse);\\n}\\npublic class ThingService : Things.ThingsBase\\n{\\n public override async Task<GetThingResponse> Get(GetThingRequest request,\\nServerCallContext context)\\n {\\n // Get thing from database\\n return new GetThingResponse { Thing = thing };\\n }\\n}\\npublic async Task ShowThing(int thingId)\\n{\\n var thing = await _thingsClient.GetAsync(new GetThingRequest { ThingId = thingId });\\n Console.WriteLine($\\\"{thing.Name}\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, implementing a gRPC unary RPC service method is similar to implementing a WCF operation. The difference is that with gRPC, you override a base class method instead of implementing an interface. On the server, gRPC base methods always return [Task,](https://docs.microsoft.\", \"com/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task-1) although the client provides both async and blocking methods to call the service.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-34-1\\\"></span>**WCF duplex, one way to client**\\n\\nWCF applications (with certain bindings) can create a persistent connection between client and server. The server can asynchronously send data to the client until the connection is closed, by using a *callback interface* specified in the [ServiceContractAttribute.CallbackContract](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.servicecontractattribute.callbackcontract) property.\\n\\ngRPC services provide similar functionality with message streams. Streams don't map *exactly* to WCF duplex services in terms of implementation, but you can achieve the same results.\\n\\n#### <span id=\\\"page-35-0\\\"></span>**gRPC streaming**\\n\\ngRPC supports the creation of persistent streams from client to server, and from server to client. Both types of stream can be active concurrently. This ability is called bidi\", \"rectional streaming.\\n\\nYou can use streams for arbitrary, asynchronous messaging over time. Or you can use them for passing large datasets that are too big to generate and send in a single request or response.\\n\\nThe following example shows a server-streaming RPC.\\n\\n```\\nservice ClockStreamer {\\n rpc Subscribe(ClockSubscribeRequest) returns (stream ClockMessage);\\n}\\npublic class ClockStreamerService : ClockStreamer.ClockStreamerBase\\n{\\n public override async Task Subscribe(ClockSubscribeRequest request,\\n IServerStreamWriter<ClockMessage> responseStream,\\n ServerCallContext context)\\n {\\n while (!context.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)\\n {\\n var time = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;\\n await responseStream.WriteAsync(new ClockMessage { message = $\\\"The time is \\n{time:t}.\\\" });\\n await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10), context.CancellationToken);\\n }\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis server stream can be consumed from a client application, as shown in the following code:\\n\\n```\\npublic async Task TellTheTimeAsync(Cancella\", \"tionToken token)\\n{\\n var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(\\\"https://localhost:5001\\\");\\n var client = new ClockStreamer.ClockStreamerClient(channel);\\n var request = new ClockSubscribeRequest();\\n var response = client.Subscribe(request);\\n await foreach (var update in response.ResponseStream.ReadAllAsync(token))\\n {\\n Console.WriteLine(update.Message);\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nServer-streaming RPCs are useful for subscription-style services. They're also useful for sending large datasets when it would be inefficient or impossible to build the entire dataset in memory. However, streaming responses isn't as fast as sending repeated fields in a single message. As a rule, streaming shouldn't be used for small datasets.\\n\\n#### **Differences from WCF**\\n\\nA WCF duplex service uses a client callback interface that can have multiple methods. A gRPC serverstreaming service can only send messages over a single stream. If you need multiple methods, use a message type with either an Any field or a oneof fiel\", \"d to send different messages, and write code in the client to handle them.\\n\\nIn WCF, the [ServiceContract](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.servicecontractattribute) class with the session is kept alive until the connection is closed. Multiple methods can be called within the session. In gRPC, the Task that the implementation method returns shouldn't finish until the connection is closed.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-36-0\\\"></span>**WCF one-way operations and gRPC client streaming**\\n\\nWCF provides one-way operations (marked with [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]) that return a transport-specific acknowledgment. gRPC service methods always return a response, even if it's empty. The client should always await that response. For the \\\"fire-and-forget\\\" style of messaging in gRPC, you can create a client streaming service.\\n\\n### **thing\\\\_log.proto**\\n\\n```\\nservice ThingLog {\\n rpc OpenConnection(stream Thing) returns (ConnectionClosedResponse);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **ThingLogService.cs**\\n\\n`\", \"``\\npublic class ThingLogService : Protos.ThingLog.ThingLogBase\\n{\\n private static readonly ConnectionClosedResponse EmptyResponse = new\\nConnectionClosedResponse();\\n private readonly ILogger<ThingLogService> _logger;\\n public ThingLogService(ILogger<ThingLogService> logger)\\n {\\n _logger = logger;\\n }\\n public override async Task<CompletedResponse> OpenConnection(IAsyncStreamReader<Thing>\\nrequestStream, ServerCallContext context)\\n {\\n while (await requestStream.MoveNext(context.CancellationToken))\\n {\\n _logger.LogInformation(requestStream.Current.Description);\\n }\\n return EmptyResponse;\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# **ThingLog client example**\\n\\n```\\npublic class ThingLogger : IAsyncDisposable\\n{\\n private readonly ThingLog.ThingLogClient _client;\\n private readonly AsyncClientStreamingCall<ThingLogRequest, CompletedResponse> _stream;\\n public ThingLogger(ThingLog.ThingLogClient client)\\n```\\n\\n```\\n {\\n _client = client;\\n _stream = client.OpenConnection();\\n }\\n public async Task WriteAsync(string description)\\n {\\n await _str\", \"eam.RequestStream.WriteAsync(new Thing\\n {\\n Description = description,\\n Time = Timestamp.FromDateTimeOffset(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow)\\n });\\n }\\n public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()\\n {\\n await _stream.RequestStream.CompleteAsync();\\n _stream.Dispose();\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can use client-streaming RPCs for fire-and-forget messaging, as shown in the previous example. You can also use them for sending very large datasets to the server. The same warning about performance applies: for smaller datasets, use repeated fields in regular messages.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-37-0\\\"></span>**WCF full-duplex services**\\n\\nWCF duplex binding supports multiple one-way operations on both the service interface and the client callback interface. This support allows ongoing conversations between client and server. gRPC supports something similar with bidirectional streaming RPCs, where both parameters are marked with the stream modifier.\\n\\n### **chat.proto**\\n\\n```\\nservice Chatter {\\n rpc Connect(stream IncomingMessage) returns (st\", \"ream OutgoingMessage);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **ChatterService.cs**\\n\\n```\\npublic class ChatterService : Chatter.ChatterBase\\n{\\n private readonly IChatHub _hub;\\n public ChatterService(IChatHub hub)\\n {\\n _hub = hub;\\n }\\n public override async Task Connect(IAsyncStreamReader<MessageRequest> requestStream,\\nIServerStreamWriter<MessageResponse> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)\\n {\\n _hub.MessageReceived += async (sender, args) =>\\n await responseStream.WriteAsync(new MessageResponse {Text = args.Message});\\n while (await requestStream.MoveNext(context.CancellationToken))\\n {\\n```\\n\\n```\\n await _hub.SendAsync(requestStream.Current.Text);\\n }\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the previous example, you can see that the implementation method receives both a request stream (IAsyncStreamReader<MessageRequest>) and a response stream (IServerStreamWriter<MessageResponse>). The method can read and write messages until the connection is closed.\\n\\n#### **Chatter client**\\n\\n```\\npublic class Chat : IAsyncDisposable\\n{\\n private readonly Chatt\", \"er.ChatterClient _client;\\n private readonly AsyncDuplexStreamingCall<MessageRequest, MessageResponse> _stream;\\n private readonly CancellationTokenSource _cancellationTokenSource;\\n private readonly Task _readTask;\\n public Chat(Chatter.ChatterClient client)\\n {\\n _client = client;\\n _stream = _client.Connect();\\n _cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();\\n _readTask = ReadAsync(_cancellationTokenSource.Token);\\n }\\n public async Task SendAsync(string message)\\n {\\n await _stream.RequestStream.WriteAsync(new MessageRequest {Text = message});\\n }\\n private async Task ReadAsync(CancellationToken token)\\n {\\n while (await _stream.ResponseStream.MoveNext(token))\\n {\\n Console.WriteLine(_stream.ResponseStream.Current.Text);\\n }\\n }\\n public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()\\n {\\n await _stream.RequestStream.CompleteAsync();\\n await _readTask;\\n _stream.Dispose();\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-38-0\\\"></span>Metadata\\n\\n*Metadata* refers to additional data that might be useful during the processing of requests\", \" and responses but that's not part of the actual application data. Metadata might include authentication tokens, request identifiers and tags for monitoring purposes, and information about the data, like the number of records in a dataset.\\n\\nIt's possible to add generic key/value headers to Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) messages by using an [OperationContextScope](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.operationcontextscope) and the [OperationContext.OutgoingMessageHeaders](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.operationcontext.outgoingmessageheaders#System_ServiceModel_OperationContext_OutgoingMessageHeaders) property and handle them by using [MessageProperties.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.channels.messageproperties)\\n\\ngRPC calls and responses can also include metadata that's similar to HTTP headers. This metadata is mostly invisible to gRPC itself and is passed through to be processed by your application cod\", \"e or middleware. Metadata is represented as key/value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is either a string or binary data. You don't need to specify metadata in the .proto file.\\n\\nMetadata is handled by the Metadata class of the [Grpc.Core.Api](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Core.Api/) NuGet package. This class can be used with collection initializer syntax.\\n\\nThis example shows how to add metadata to a call from a C# client:\\n\\n```\\nvar metadata = new Metadata\\n{\\n { \\\"Requester\\\", _clientName }\\n};\\nvar request = new GetPortfolioRequest\\n{\\n Id = portfolioId\\n};\\nvar response = await client.GetPortfolioAsync(request, metadata);\\n```\\n\\ngRPC services can access metadata from the ServerCallContext argument's RequestHeaders property:\\n\\n```\\npublic async Task<GetPortfolioResponse> GetPortfolio(GetPortfolioRequest request,\\nServerCallContext context)\\n{\\n var requesterHeader = context.RequestHeaders.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Key == \\\"Requester\\\");\\n if (requesterHeader != null)\\n {\\n _logger.LogInforma\", \"tion($\\\"Request from {requesterHeader.Value}\\\");\\n }\\n // ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nServices can send metadata to clients by using the ResponseTrailers property of ServerCallContext:\\n\\n```\\npublic async Task<GetPortfolioResponse> GetPortfolio(GetPortfolioRequest request,\\nServerCallContext context)\\n{\\n // ...\\n context.ResponseTrailers.Add(\\\"Responder\\\", _serverName);\\n // ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-39-0\\\"></span>Error handling\\n\\nWindows Communication Foundation (WCF) uses [FaultException](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.faultexception-1) and [FaultContract](xref:System.ServiceModel.FaultContractAttribute) to provide detailed error information, including supporting the SOAP Fault standard.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the current version of gRPC lacks the sophistication found with WCF, and only has limited built-in error handling based on simple status codes and metadata. The following table is a quick guide to the most commonly used status codes:\\n\\n| Status code                   | Problem           \", \"                           |  |\\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--|\\n| GRPC_STATUS_UNIMPLEMENTED     | Method hasn't been written.                  |  |\\n| GRPC_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE       | Problem with the whole service.              |  |\\n| GRPC_STATUS_UNKNOWN           | Invalid response.                            |  |\\n| GRPC_STATUS_INTERNAL          | Problem with encoding/decoding.              |  |\\n| GRPC_STATUS_UNAUTHENTICATED   | Authentication failed.                       |  |\\n| GRPC_STATUS_PERMISSION_DENIED | Authorization failed.                        |  |\\n| GRPC_STATUS_CANCELLED         | Call was canceled, usually by the<br>caller. |  |\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-40-0\\\"></span>**Raise errors in ASP.NET Core gRPC**\\n\\nAn ASP.NET Core gRPC service can send an error response by throwing an RpcException, which can be caught by the client as if it were in the same process. The RpcException must include a status code and description, and can opt\", \"ionally include metadata and a longer exception message. The metadata can be used to send supporting data, similar to how FaultContract objects can carry additional data for WCF errors.\\n\\n```\\npublic async Task<GetPortfolioResponse> GetPortfolio(GetPortfolioRequest request,\\nServerCallContext context)\\n{\\n var user = context.GetHttpContext().User;\\n if (!ValidateUser(user))\\n {\\n var metadata = new Metadata\\n {\\n { \\\"User\\\", user.Identity.Name }\\n };\\n throw new RpcException(new Status(StatusCode.PermissionDenied, \\\"Permission \\ndenied\\\"), metadata);\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-40-1\\\"></span>**Catch errors in gRPC clients**\\n\\nJust like WCF clients can catch [FaultException](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.faultexception-1) errors, a gRPC client can catch an RpcException to handle errors. Because RpcException isn't a generic type, you can't catch different error types in different blocks. But you can use C#'s *exception filters* feature to declare separate catch blocks for differe\", \"nt status codes, as shown in the following example:\\n\\n```\\ntry\\n{\\n var portfolio = await client.GetPortfolioAsync(new GetPortfolioRequest { Id = id });\\n}\\ncatch (RpcException ex) when (ex.StatusCode == StatusCode.PermissionDenied)\\n```\\n\\n```\\n{\\n var userEntry = ex.Trailers.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Key == \\\"User\\\");\\n Console.WriteLine($\\\"User '{userEntry.Value}' does not have permission to view this \\nportfolio.\\\");\\n}\\ncatch (RpcException)\\n{\\n // Handle any other error type ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Important**\\n\\nWhen you provide additional metadata for errors, be sure to document the relevant keys and values in your API documentation, or in comments in your .proto file.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-41-0\\\"></span>**gRPC richer error model**\\n\\nGoogle has developed a [richer error model](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_model) that's more like WCF's [FaultContract](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.faultcontractattribute), but this model isn't supported in C# yet. Currently, it's only \", \"available for Go, Java, Python, and C++.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-41-1\\\"></span>WS-\\\\* protocols\\n\\nOne of the real benefits of working with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) was that it supported many of the existing *WS-\\\\** standard protocols. This section will briefly cover how gRPC manages the same WS-\\\\* protocols and discuss what options are available when there's no alternative.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-41-2\\\"></span>**Metadata exchange: WS-Policy, WS-Discovery, and so on**\\n\\nSOAP services expose Web Services Description Language (WSDL) schema documents with information such as data formats, operations, or communication options. You can use this schema to generate the client code.\\n\\ngRPC works best when servers and clients are generated from the same .proto files, but a Server Reflection optional extension does provide a way to expose dynamic information from a running server. For more information, see the [Grpc.Reflection](https://nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Reflection) NuGet package.\\n\\nThe WS-Disco\", \"very protocol is used to locate services on a local network. gRPC services are located through DNS or a service registry such as Consul or ZooKeeper.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-41-3\\\"></span>**Security: WS-Security, WS-Federation, XML Encryption, and so on**\\n\\nSecurity, authentication, and authorization are covered in much more detail in [chapter 6](#page-74-0). But it's worth noting here that, unlike WCF, gRPC doesn't support WS-Security, WS-Federation, or XML Encryption. Even so, gRPC provides excellent security. All gRPC network traffic is automatically encrypted when it's using HTTP/2 over TLS. You can use X509 certificates for mutual client/server authentication.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-42-0\\\"></span>**WS-ReliableMessaging**\\n\\ngRPC does not provide an equivalent to WS-ReliableMessaging. Retry semantics should be handled in code, possibly with a library like [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly). When you're running in Kubernetes or similar orchestration environments, [service meshes](#page-99\", \"-0) can also help to provide reliable messaging between services.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-42-1\\\"></span>**WS-Transaction, WS-Coordination**\\n\\nWCF's implementation of distributed transactions uses Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC). It works with resource managers that specifically support it, like SQL Server, MSMQ, or Windows file systems. There's no equivalent yet in the modern microservices world, in part due to the wider range of technologies in use. For a discussion of transactions, see [Appendix A.](#page-110-0)\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-43-0\\\"></span>Migrate a WCF solution to gRPC\\n\\nThis chapter will describe how to work with ASP.NET Core 7.0 gRPC projects and demonstrate migrating different types of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services to the gRPC equivalent:\\n\\n- Create an ASP.NET Core 7.0 gRPC project.\\n- Simple request-reply operations to gRPC unary RPC.\\n- One-way operations to gRPC client streaming RPC.\\n- Full-duplex services to gRPC bidirectional streaming RPC.\\n\\nT\", \"here's also a comparison of using streaming services versus repeated fields for returning datasets, and there's a discussion of the use of client libraries at the end of the chapter.\\n\\nThe sample WCF application is a minimal stub of a set of stock trading services. It uses the opensource Inversion of Control (IoC) container library called Autofac for dependency injection. It includes three services, one for each WCF service type. The services will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. You can download the solutions from [dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers) on GitHub.

This chapter shows both ways to create a new ASP.NET Core gRPC project.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-43-2\\\"></span>**Create the project by using Visual Studio**\\n\\n#### **Important**\\n\\nTo develop any ASP.NET Core 7.0 app, you need Visual Studio 2022, with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload installed.\\n\\nCreate an empty solution called **TraderSys** from the *Blank Solution* template. Add a solution folder called src. Then, right-click on the folder and choose **Add** > **New Project**.

Docker will be introduced later, so for now, leave that option unselected. Just select **Create**. Your first ASP.NET Core 7.0 gRPC project is generated and added to the solution.

The -o (or --output) flag specifies the output directory, which is created in the current directory if it doesn't already exist. The solution has the same name as the directory: TraderSys.sln. You can provide a different name by using the -n (or --name) flag.\\n\\n```\\ndotnet new sln -o TraderSys\\ncd TraderSys\\n```\\n\\nASP.NET Core 7.0 comes with a CLI template for gRPC servi\", \"ces.

But in some other editor, such as Visual Studio Code, this reference isn't updated automatically, so you need to edit the project file manually.\\n\\nIn the gRPC build targets, there's a Protobuf item\", \" element that lets you specify which .proto files should be compiled, and which form of code generation is required (that is, \\\"Server\\\" or \\\"Client\\\").\\n\\n```\\n<ItemGroup>\\n <Protobuf Include=\\\"Protos\\\\portfolios.proto\\\" GrpcServices=\\\"Server\\\" />\\n</ItemGroup>\\n```\\n\\n#### **Rename the GreeterService class**\\n\\nThe GreeterService class is in the Services folder and inherits from Greeter.GreeterBase.

These services are the simplest service types in both Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and gRPC, so it's an excellent place to start. After migrating the service, you'll learn how to generate a client library from the same .proto file to consume the service from a .NET client application.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-48-1\\\"></span>**The WCF solution**\\n\\nThe [PortfoliosSample solution](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/main/Portf\", \"oliosSample/wcf/TraderSys) includes a simple request-reply Portfolio service to download either a single portfolio or all portfolios for a given trader. The service is defined in the interface IPortfolioService with a ServiceContract attribute:\\n\\n```\\n[ServiceContract]\\npublic interface IPortfolioService\\n{\\n [OperationContract]\\n Task<Portfolio> Get(Guid traderId, int portfolioId);\\n [OperationContract]\\n Task<List<Portfolio>> GetAll(Guid traderId);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe Portfolio model is a simple C# class marked with [DataContract](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.datacontractattribute) and including a list of PortfolioItem objects. These models are defined in the TraderSys.PortfolioData project along with a repository class that represents a data access abstraction.\\n\\n```\\n[DataContract]\\npublic class Portfolio\\n{\\n [DataMember]\\n public int Id { get; set; }\\n [DataMember]\\n public Guid TraderId { get; set; }\\n [DataMember]\\n public List<PortfolioItem> Items { get; set; }\\n}\\n[D\", \"ataContract]\\npublic class PortfolioItem\\n{\\n [DataMember]\\n public int Id { get; set; }\\n [DataMember]\\n public int ShareId { get; set; }\\n [DataMember]\\n public int Holding { get; set; }\\n [DataMember]\\n public decimal Cost { get; set; }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe ServiceContract implementation uses a repository class provided via dependency injection that returns instances of the DataContract types:\\n\\n```\\npublic class PortfolioService : Protos.Portfolios.PortfoliosBase\\n{\\n private readonly IPortfolioRepository _repository;\\n public PortfolioService(IPortfolioRepository repository)\\n {\\n _repository = repository;\\n }\\n public async Task<Portfolio> Get(Guid traderId, int portfolioId)\\n {\\n return await _repository.GetAsync(traderId, portfolioId);\\n }\\n public async Task<List<Portfolio>> GetAll(Guid traderId)\\n {\\n return await _repository.GetAllAsync(traderId);\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-50-0\\\"></span>**The portfolios.proto file**\\n\\nIf you followed the instructions in the previous section, you should have a gRPC project with\", \" a portfolios.proto file that looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nsyntax = \\\"proto3\\\";\\noption csharp_namespace = \\\"TraderSys.Portfolios.Protos\\\";\\npackage PortfolioServer;\\nservice Portfolios {\\n // RPCs will go here\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe first step is to migrate the DataContract classes to their Protobuf equivalents.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-50-1\\\"></span>**Convert the DataContract classes to gRPC messages**\\n\\nThe PortfolioItem class will be converted to a Protobuf message first, because the Portfolio class depends on it. The class is simple, and three of the properties map directly to gRPC data types. The Cost property, which represents the price paid for the shares at purchase, is a decimal field. gRPC supports only float or double for real numbers, which aren't suitable for currency. Because share prices vary by a minimum of one cent, the cost can be expressed as an int32 of cents.\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nRemember to use snake\\\\_case for field names in your .proto file. The C# code generator will convert them to PascalCase for you\", \", and users of other languages will thank you for respecting their different coding standards.\\n\\n```\\nmessage PortfolioItem {\\n int32 id = 1;\\n int32 share_id = 2;\\n int32 holding = 3;\\n int32 cost_cents = 4;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe Portfolio class is a little more complicated. In the WCF code, the developer used a Guid for the TraderId property, and contains a List<PortfolioItem>. In Protobuf, which doesn't have a first-class UUID type, you should use a string for the traderId field and parse it in your own code. For the list of items, use the repeated keyword on the field.\\n\\n```\\nmessage Portfolio {\\n int32 id = 1;\\n string trader_id = 2;\\n repeated PortfolioItem items = 3;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow that you have the data messages, you can declare the service RPC endpoints.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-51-0\\\"></span>**Convert ServiceContract to a gRPC service**\\n\\nThe WCF Get method takes two parameters: Guid traderId and int portfolioId. gRPC service methods can take only a single parameter, so you need to create a message to hold the\", \" two values. It's common practice to name these request objects with the same name as the method followed by the suffix Request. Again, string is being used for the traderId field instead of Guid.\\n\\nThe service could just return a Portfolio message directly, but again, this could affect backward compatibility in the future. It's a good practice to define separate Request and Response messages for every method in a service, even if many of them are the same right now. So declare a GetResponse message with a single Portfolio field.\\n\\nThis example shows the declaration of the gRPC service method with the GetRequest message:\\n\\n```\\nmessage GetRequest {\\n string trader_id = 1;\\n int32 portfolio_id = 2;\\n}\\nmessage GetResponse {\\n Portfolio portfolio = 1;\\n}\\nservice Portfolios {\\n rpc Get(GetRequest) returns (GetResponse);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe WCF GetAll method takes only a single parameter, traderId, so it might seem that you could specify string as the parameter type. But gRPC requires a defined message type. \", \"This requirement helps to enforce the practice of using custom messages for all inputs and outputs, for future backward compatibility.\\n\\nThe WCF method also returns a List<Portfolio>, but for the same reason it doesn't allow simple parameter types, gRPC won't allow repeated Portfolio as a return type. Instead, create a GetAllResponse type to wrap the list.\\n\\n#### **Warning**\\n\\nYou might be tempted to create a PortfolioList message or something similar and use it across multiple service methods, but you should resist this temptation. It's impossible to know how the various methods on a service will evolve, so keep their messages specific and cleanly separated.\\n\\n```\\nmessage GetAllRequest {\\n string trader_id = 1;\\n}\\nmessage GetAllResponse {\\n repeated Portfolio portfolios = 1;\\n}\\nservice Portfolios {\\n rpc Get(GetRequest) returns (GetResponse);\\n```\\n\\n```\\n rpc GetAll(GetAllRequest) returns (GetAllResponse);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you save your project with these changes, the gRPC build target will run in the b\", \"ackground and generate all the Protobuf message types and a base class that you can inherit to implement the service.\\n\\nOpen the Services/GreeterService.cs class and delete the example code. Now you can add the Portfolio service implementation. The generated base class will be in the Protos namespace and is generated as a nested class. gRPC creates a static class with the same name as the service in the .proto file and a base class with the suffix Base inside that static class, so the full identifier for the base type is TraderSys.Portfolios.Protos.Portfolios.PortfoliosBase.\\n\\n```\\nnamespace TraderSys.Portfolios.Services;\\npublic class PortfolioService : Protos.Portfolios.PortfoliosBase\\n{\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe base class declares virtual methods for Get and GetAll that can be overridden to implement the service. The methods are virtual rather than abstract so that if you don't implement them, the service can return an explicit gRPC Unimplemented status code, much like you might throw a NotImplemented\", \"Exception in regular C# code.\\n\\nThe signature for all gRPC unary service methods in ASP.NET Core is consistent. There are two parameters: the first is the message type declared in the .proto file, and the second is a ServerCallContext that works similarly to the HttpContext from ASP.NET Core. In fact, there's an extension method called GetHttpContext on the ServerCallContext class that you can use to get the underlying HttpContext, although you shouldn't need to use it often. We'll take a look at ServerCallContext later in this chapter, and also in the chapter that discusses authentication.\\n\\nThe method's return type is a Task<T>, where T is the response message type. All gRPC service methods are asynchronous.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-52-0\\\"></span>**Migrate the PortfolioData library to .NET**\\n\\nAt this point, the project needs the Portfolio repository and models contained in the TraderSys.PortfolioData class library in the WCF solution. The easiest way to bring them across is to create a new cla\", \"ss library by using either the Visual Studio **New project** dialog box with the Class Library (.NET Standard) template, or from the command line by using the .NET CLI, running these commands from the directory that contains the TraderSys.sln file:\\n\\n```\\ndotnet new classlib -o src/TraderSys.PortfolioData\\ndotnet sln add src/TraderSys.PortfolioData\\n```\\n\\nAfter you've created the library and added it to the solution, delete the generated Class1.cs file and copy the files from the WCF solution's library into the new class library's folder, keeping the folder structure:\\n\\n```\\nModels\\n Portfolio.cs\\n PortfolioItem.cs\\n```\\n\\n```\\nIPortfolioRepository.cs\\nPortfolioRepository.cs\\n```\\n\\nSDK-style .NET projects automatically include any .cs files in or under their own directory, so you don't need to explicitly add them to the project. The only step remaining is to remove the DataContract and DataMember attributes from the Portfolio and PortfolioItem classes so they're plain old C# classes:\\n\\n```\\npublic class\", \" Portfolio\\n{\\n public int Id { get; set; }\\n public Guid TraderId { get; set; }\\n public List<PortfolioItem> Items { get; set; }\\n}\\npublic class PortfolioItem\\n{\\n public int Id { get; set; }\\n public int ShareId { get; set; }\\n public int Holding { get; set; }\\n public decimal Cost { get; set; }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-53-0\\\"></span>**Use ASP.NET Core dependency injection**\\n\\nNow you can add a reference to this library to the gRPC application project and consume the PortfolioRepository class by using dependency injection in the gRPC service implementation. In the WCF application, dependency injection was provided by the Autofac IoC container. ASP.NET Core has dependency injection baked in. You can register the repository in the *Program.cs* itself:\\n\\n```\\nusing TraderSys.Portfolios.Services;\\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\\n// Register the repository class as a scoped service (instance per request)\\nbuilder.Services.AddScoped<IPortfolioRepository, PortfolioRepository>();\\nbuilder.S\", \"ervices.AddGrpc();\\nvar app = builder.Build();\\n// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.\\napp.MapGrpcService<PortfolioService>();\\napp.MapGet(\\\"/\\\", () => \\\"Communication with gRPC endpoints must be made through a gRPC \\nclient. To learn how to create a client, visit: \\nhttps://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086909\\\");\\napp.Run();\\n```\\n\\nThe IPortfolioRepository implementation can now be specified as a constructor parameter in the PortfolioService class, as follows:\\n\\n```\\npublic class PortfolioService : Protos.Portfolios.PortfoliosBase\\n{\\n private readonly IPortfolioRepository _repository;\\n public PortfolioService(IPortfolioRepository repository)\\n {\\n```\\n\\n```\\n _repository = repository;\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-54-0\\\"></span>**Implement the gRPC service**\\n\\nNow that you've declared your messages and your service in the portfolios.proto file, you have to implement the service methods in the PortfolioService class that inherits from the gRPC-generated Portfolios.PortfoliosBase class. The methods are de\", \"clared as virtual in the base class. If you don't override them, they'll return a gRPC \\\"Not Implemented\\\" status code by default.\\n\\nStart by implementing the Get method. The default override looks like this example:\\n\\n```\\npublic override Task<GetResponse> Get(GetRequest request, ServerCallContext context)\\n{\\n return base.Get(request, context);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe first problem is that request.TraderId is a string, and the service requires a Guid. Even though the expected format for the string is UUID, the code has to deal with the possibility that a caller has sent an invalid value and respond appropriately. The service can respond with errors by throwing an RpcException and use the standard InvalidArgument status code to express the problem:\\n\\n```\\npublic override Task<GetResponse> Get(GetRequest request, ServerCallContext context)\\n{\\n if (!Guid.TryParse(request.TraderId, out var traderId))\\n {\\n throw new RpcException(new Status(StatusCode.InvalidArgument, \\\"traderId must be a \\nUUID\\\"));\\n }\\n return base\", \".Get(request, context);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfter there's a proper Guid value for traderId, you can use the repository to retrieve the Portfolio and return it to the client:\\n\\n```\\n var response = new GetResponse\\n {\\n Portfolio = await _repository.GetAsync(request.TraderId, request.PortfolioId)\\n };\\n```\\n\\n### **Map internal models to gRPC messages**\\n\\nThe previous code doesn't actually work because the repository is returning its own POCO model Portfolio, but gRPC needs its own Protobuf message Portfolio. As when you map Entity Framework types to data transfer types, the best solution is to provide a conversion between the two. A good place to put the code for this conversion is in the Protobuf-generated class, which is declared as a partial class so it can be extended:\\n\\n```\\nnamespace TraderSys.Portfolios.Protos;\\npublic partial class PortfolioItem\\n{\\n public static PortfolioItem FromRepositoryModel(PortfolioData.Models.PortfolioItem\\n```\\n\\n```\\nsource)\\n {\\n if (source is null) return null;\\n return new Portfol\", \"ioItem\\n {\\n Id = source.Id,\\n ShareId = source.ShareId,\\n Holding = source.Holding,\\n CostCents = (int)(source.Cost * 100)\\n };\\n }\\n}\\npublic partial class Portfolio\\n{\\n public static Portfolio FromRepositoryModel(PortfolioData.Models.Portfolio source)\\n {\\n if (source is null) return null;\\n var target = new Portfolio\\n {\\n Id = source.Id,\\n TraderId = source.TraderId.ToString(),\\n };\\n target.Items.AddRange(source.Items.Select(PortfolioItem.FromRepositoryModel));\\n return target;\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nYou could use a library like [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/) to handle this conversion from internal model classes to Protobuf types, as long as you configure the lower-level type conversions like string/Guid or decimal/double and the list mapping.\\n\\nNow that you have the conversion code in place, you can complete the Get method implementation:\\n\\n```\\npublic override async Task<GetResponse> Get(GetRequest request, ServerCallContext context)\\n{\\n if (!Guid.TryParse(request.TraderId, out var traderId)\", \")\\n {\\n throw new RpcException(new Status(StatusCode.InvalidArgument, \\\"traderId must be a \\nUUID\\\"));\\n }\\n var portfolio = await _repository.GetAsync(traderId, request.PortfolioId);\\n return new GetResponse\\n {\\n Portfolio = Portfolio.FromRepositoryModel(portfolio)\\n };\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe implementation of the GetAll method is similar. Note that the repeated fields on Protobuf messages are generated as readonly properties of type RepeatedField<T>, so you have to add items to them by using the AddRange method, like in this example:\\n\\n```\\npublic override async Task<GetAllResponse> GetAll(GetAllRequest request, ServerCallContext \\ncontext)\\n{\\n if (!Guid.TryParse(request.TraderId, out var traderId))\\n {\\n throw new RpcException(new Status(StatusCode.InvalidArgument, \\\"traderId must be a \\nUUID\\\"));\\n }\\n var portfolios = await _repository.GetAllAsync(traderId);\\n var response = new GetAllResponse();\\n response.Portfolios.AddRange(portfolios.Select(Portfolio.FromRepositoryModel));\\n return response;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHaving succes\", \"sfully migrated the WCF request-reply service to gRPC, let's look at creating a client for it from the .proto file.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-56-0\\\"></span>**Generate client code**\\n\\nCreate a .NET Standard class library in the same solution to contain the client. This is primarily an example of creating client code, but you could package such a library by using NuGet and distribute it on an internal repository for other .NET teams to consume. Go ahead and add a new .NET Standard class library called TraderSys.Portfolios.Client to the solution and delete the Class1.cs file.\\n\\n#### **Caution**\\n\\nThe [Grpc.Net.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Net.Client) NuGet package requires .NET Core 3.0 or later (or another .NET Standard 2.1 compliant runtime). Earlier versions of .NET Framework and .NET Core are supported by the [Grpc.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Core) NuGet package.\\n\\nIn Visual Studio 2022, you can add references to gRPC services in a way that's similar to how you'd add \", \"service references to WCF projects in earlier versions of Visual Studio. Service references and connected services are all managed under the same UI now. You can access the UI by right-clicking the **Dependencies** node in the TraderSys.Portfolios.Client project in Solution Explorer and selecting **Manage Connected Service**. In the tool window that appears, select the **Connected Services** section, then select **Add a service reference** in Service References section, select gRPC and click Next:\\n\\n![](_page_57_Figure_0.jpeg)\\n\\n![](_page_57_Figure_1.jpeg)\\n\\nBrowse to the portfolios.proto file in the TraderSys.Portfolios project, leave **Client** under **Select the type of class to be generated**, and then select **OK**:\\n\\n![](_page_58_Picture_0.jpeg)\\n\\n#### **Tip**\\n\\nNotice that this dialog box also provides a URL field. If your organization maintains a web-accessible directory of .proto files, you can create clients just by setting this URL address.\\n\\nWhen you use the Visual Studio **Add Co\", \"nnected Service** feature, the portfolios.proto file is added to the class library project as a *linked file* rather than copied, so changes to the file in the service project will automatically be applied in the client project. The <Protobuf> element in the csproj file looks like this:\\n\\n<**Protobuf** Include=\\\"..\\\\TraderSys.Portfolios\\\\Protos\\\\portfolios.proto\\\" GrpcServices=\\\"Client\\\"> <**Link**>Protos\\\\portfolios.proto</**Link**> </**Protobuf**>\\n\\n#### **Tip**\\n\\nIf you're not using Visual Studio or prefer to work from the command line, you can use the dotnetgrpc global tool to manage Protobuf references in a .NET gRPC project. For more information, see the dotnet-grpc [documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/dotnet-grpc)\\n\\n### **Use the Portfolios service from a client application**\\n\\nThe following code is a brief example of how to use the generated client in a console application. A more detailed exploration of the gRPC client code is at the end of this chapter.\\n\\n```\\npublic\", \" class Program\\n{\\n public async Task Main(string[] args)\\n {\\n GetResponse response;\\n using (var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(\\\"https://localhost:5001\\\"))\\n {\\n var client = new Protos.Portfolios.PortfoliosClient(channel);\\n response = await client.GetAsync(new GetRequest\\n {\\n TraderId = args[0],\\n PortfolioId = int.Parse(args[1])\\n });\\n }\\n foreach (var item in response.Portfolio.Items)\\n {\\n Console.WriteLine($\\\"Holding {item.Holding} of Share ID {item.ShareId}.\\\");\\n }\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou've now migrated a basic WCF application to an ASP.NET Core gRPC service and created a client to consume the service from a .NET application. The next section will cover the more involved duplex services.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-59-0\\\"></span>Migrate WCF duplex services to gRPC\\n\\nNow that you have a sense of the basic concepts, in this section, you'll look at the more complicated *streaming* gRPC services.\\n\\nThere are multiple ways to use duplex services in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). Some services are initiated by\", \" the client and then they stream data from the server. Other full-duplex services might involve more ongoing two-way communication, like the classic Calculator example in the WCF documentation. This chapter will take two possible WCF stock ticker implementations and migrate them to gRPC: one that uses a server streaming RPC and another one that uses a bidirectional streaming RPC.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-59-1\\\"></span>**Server streaming RPC**\\n\\nIn the [sample SimpleStockTicker WCF solution](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/main/SimpleStockTickerSample/wcf/SimpleStockTicker), SimpleStockPriceTicker, there's a duplex service for which the client starts the connection with a list of stock symbols, and the server uses the *callback interface* to send updates as they become available. The client implements that interface to respond to calls from the server.\\n\\n#### **The WCF solution**\\n\\nThe WCF solution is implemented as a self-hosted Net.TCP server in a .NET Framewo\", \"rk 4.*x* console application.\\n\\n#### **ServiceContract**\\n\\n```\\n[ServiceContract(SessionMode = SessionMode.Required, CallbackContract =\\ntypeof(ISimpleStockTickerCallback))]\\npublic interface ISimpleStockTickerService\\n{\\n [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\\n void Subscribe(string[] symbols);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe service has a single method with no return type because it uses the callback interface ISimpleStockTickerCallback to send data to the client in real time.\\n\\n#### **The callback interface**\\n\\n```\\n[ServiceContract]\\npublic interface ISimpleStockTickerCallback\\n{\\n [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\\n void Update(string symbol, decimal price);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can find the implementations of these interfaces in the solution, along with faked external dependencies to provide test data.\\n\\n#### **gRPC streaming**\\n\\nThe gRPC process for handling real-time data is different from the WCF process. A call from client to server can create a persistent stream, which can be monitored for messages that arrive asynchron\", \"ously. Despite the difference, streams can be a more intuitive way of dealing with this data and are more relevant in modern programming, which emphasizes LINQ, Reactive Streams, functional programming, and so on.\\n\\nThe service definition needs two messages: one for the request and one for the stream. The service returns a stream of the StockTickerUpdate message with the stream keyword in its return declaration. We recommend that you add a Timestamp to the update to show the exact time of the price change.\\n\\n#### **simple\\\\_stock\\\\_ticker.proto**\\n\\n```\\nsyntax = \\\"proto3\\\";\\noption csharp_namespace = \\\"TraderSys.SimpleStockTickerServer.Protos\\\";\\nimport \\\"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto\\\";\\npackage SimpleStockTickerServer;\\nservice SimpleStockTicker {\\n rpc Subscribe (SubscribeRequest) returns (stream StockTickerUpdate);\\n}\\nmessage SubscribeRequest {\\n repeated string symbols = 1;\\n}\\nmessage StockTickerUpdate {\\n```\\n\\n```\\n string symbol = 1;\\n int32 price_cents = 2;\\n google.protobuf.Timestamp time = 3;\\n}\\n```\", \"\\n\\n#### **Implement SimpleStockTicker**\\n\\nReuse the fake StockPriceSubscriber from the WCF project by copying the three classes from the TraderSys.StockMarket class library into a new .NET Standard class library in the target solution. To better follow best practices, add a Factory type to create instances of it, and register the IStockPriceSubscriberFactory with the ASP.NET Core dependency injection services.\\n\\n#### **The factory implementation**\\n\\n```\\npublic interface IStockPriceSubscriberFactory\\n{\\n IStockPriceSubscriber GetSubscriber(string[] symbols);\\n}\\npublic class StockPriceSubscriberFactory : IStockPriceSubscriberFactory\\n{\\n public IStockPriceSubscriber GetSubscriber(string[] symbols)\\n {\\n return new StockPriceSubscriber(symbols);\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Register the factory**\\n\\n```\\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\\n// Additional configuration is required to successfully run gRPC on macOS.\\n// For instructions on how to configure Kestrel and gRPC clients on macOS, visit \\nhttps:\", \"//go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099682\\n// Add services to the container.\\n// Register the factory\\nbuilder.Services.AddSingleton<IStockPriceSubscriberFactory, StockPriceSubscriberFactory>();\\nbuilder.Services.AddGrpc();\\nvar app = builder.Build();\\n// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.\\napp.MapGrpcService<StockTickerService>();\\napp.MapGet(\\\"/\\\", async context =>\\n{\\n await context.Response.WriteAsync(\\\"Communication with gRPC endpoints must be made \\nthrough a gRPC client. To learn how to create a client, visit: \\nhttps://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086909\\\");\\n});\\napp.Run();\\n```\\n\\nThis class can now be used to implement the gRPC StockTickerService.\\n\\n#### **StockTickerService.cs**\\n\\n```\\npublic class StockTickerService : Protos.SimpleStockTicker.SimpleStockTickerBase\\n{\\n private readonly IStockPriceSubscriberFactory _subscriberFactory;\\n public StockTickerService(IStockPriceSubscriberFactory subscriberFactory)\\n {\\n _subscriberFactory = subscriberFactory;\\n }\\n public override async Task Subscribe(S\", \"ubscribeRequest request,\\nIServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)\\n {\\n var subscriber = _subscriberFactory.GetSubscriber(request.Symbols.ToArray());\\n subscriber.Update += async (sender, args) =>\\n await WriteUpdateAsync(responseStream, args.Symbol, args.Price);\\n await AwaitCancellation(context.CancellationToken);\\n }\\n private async Task WriteUpdateAsync(IServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate> stream,\\nstring symbol, decimal price)\\n {\\n try\\n {\\n await stream.WriteAsync(new StockTickerUpdate\\n {\\n Symbol = symbol,\\n PriceCents = (int)(price * 100),\\n Time = Timestamp.FromDateTimeOffset(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow)\\n });\\n }\\n catch (Exception e)\\n {\\n // Handle any errors caused by broken connection, etc.\\n _logger.LogError($\\\"Failed to write message: {e.Message}\\\");\\n }\\n }\\n private static Task AwaitCancellation(CancellationToken token)\\n {\\n var completion = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();\\n token.Register(() => completion.SetResult(null));\\n return completion.Task;\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"```\\n\\nAs you can see, although the declaration in the .proto file says the method returns a stream of StockTickerUpdate messages, it actually returns a Task. The job of creating the stream is handled by the generated code and the gRPC runtime libraries, which provide the IServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate> response stream, ready to use.\\n\\nUnlike a WCF duplex service, where the instance of the service class is kept alive while the connection is open, the gRPC service uses the returned task to keep the service alive. The task shouldn't complete until the connection is closed.\\n\\nThe service can tell when the client has closed the connection by using the CancellationToken from the ServerCallContext. A simple static method, AwaitCancellation, is used to create a task that completes when the token is canceled.\\n\\nIn the Subscribe method, then, get a StockPriceSubscriber and add an event handler that writes to the response stream. Then wait for the connection to be closed before immediately dis\", \"posing the subscriber to prevent it from trying to write data to the closed stream.\\n\\nThe WriteUpdateAsync method has a try/catch block to handle any errors that might happen when a message is written to the stream. This consideration is important in persistent connections over networks, which could be broken at any millisecond, whether intentionally or because of a failure somewhere.\\n\\n#### **Use StockTickerService from a client application**\\n\\nFollow the same steps in the previous section to create a shareable client class library from the .proto file. In the sample, there's a .NET console application that demonstrates how to use the client.\\n\\n#### **Example Program.cs**\\n\\n```\\nclass Program\\n{\\n static async Task Main(string[] args)\\n {\\n using var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(\\\"https://localhost:5001\\\");\\n var client = new SimpleStockTicker.SimpleStockTickerClient(channel);\\n var request = new SubscribeRequest();\\n request.Symbols.AddRange(args);\\n using var stream = client.Subscribe(request);\", \"\\n var tokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();\\n var task = DisplayAsync(stream.ResponseStream, tokenSource.Token);\\n WaitForExitKey();\\n tokenSource.Cancel();\\n await task;\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this case, the Subscribe method on the generated client isn't asynchronous. The stream is created and usable right away because its MoveNext method is asynchronous and the first time it's called it won't complete until the connection is alive.\\n\\nThe stream is passed to an asynchronous DisplayAsync method. The application then waits for the user to press a key, and then cancels the DisplayAsync method and waits for the task to complete before exiting.\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nThis code uses the new C# 8 using declaration syntax to dispose of the stream and the channel when the Main method exits. It's a small change, but a nice one that reduces indentations and empty lines.\\n\\n#### **Consume the stream**\\n\\nWCF uses callback interfaces to allow the server to call methods directly on the client. gRPC streams work diffe\", \"rently. The client iterates over the returned stream and processes messages, just as though they were returned from a local method returning an IEnumerable.\\n\\nThe IAsyncStreamReader<T> type works much like an IEnumerator<T>. There's a MoveNext method that returns true as long as there's more data, and a Current property that returns the latest value. The only difference is that the MoveNext method returns a Task<bool> instead of just a bool. The ReadAllAsync extension method wraps the stream in a standard C# 8 IAsyncEnumerable that can be used with the new await foreach syntax.\\n\\n```\\nstatic async Task DisplayAsync(IAsyncStreamReader<StockTickerUpdate> stream,\\nCancellationToken token)\\n{\\n try\\n {\\n await foreach (var update in stream.ReadAllAsync(token))\\n {\\n Console.WriteLine($\\\"{update.Symbol}: {update.Price}\\\");\\n }\\n }\\n catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode == StatusCode.Cancelled)\\n {\\n return;\\n }\\n catch (OperationCanceledException)\\n {\\n Console.WriteLine(\\\"Finished.\\\");\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Tip*\", \"*\\n\\nFor developers using reactive programming patterns, the section on [client libraries](#page-71-1) at the end of this chapter shows how to add an extension method and classes to wrap IAsyncStreamReader<T> in an IObservable<T>.\\n\\nAgain, be sure to catch exceptions here because of the possibility of network failure, and because of the [OperationCanceledException](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.operationcanceledexception) that will inevitably be thrown because the code is using a [CancellationToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken) to break the loop. The RpcException type has a lot of useful information about gRPC runtime errors, including the StatusCode. For more information, see *[Error handling](#page-39-0)* in Chapter 4.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-64-0\\\"></span>**Bidirectional streaming**\\n\\nA WCF full-duplex service allows for asynchronous, real-time messaging in both directions. In the server streaming example, the client starts a request \", \"and then receives a stream of updates. A better version of that service would allow the client to add and remove stocks from the list without having to stop and create a new subscription. That functionality has been implemented in the [FullStockTicker](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/main/FullStockTickerSample/wcf/FullStockTicker)  [sample solution.](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/main/FullStockTickerSample/wcf/FullStockTicker)\\n\\nThe IFullStockTickerService interface provides three methods:\\n\\n- Subscribe starts the connection.\\n- AddSymbol adds a stock symbol to watch.\\n- RemoveSymbol removes a symbol from the watched list.\\n\\n```\\n[ServiceContract(SessionMode = SessionMode.Required, CallbackContract =\\ntypeof(IFullStockTickerCallback))]\\npublic interface IFullStockTickerService\\n{\\n [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\\n void Subscribe();\\n [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\\n void AddSymbol(string symbol);\\n [OperationContra\", \"ct(IsOneWay = true)]\\n void RemoveSymbol(string symbol);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe callback interface remains the same.\\n\\nImplementing this pattern in gRPC is less straightforward because there are now two streams of data with messages being passed: one from client to server and another from server to client. It isn't possible to use multiple methods to implement the add and remove operations, but you can pass more than one type of message on a single stream by using either the Any type or the oneof keyword, which were covered in Chapter 3.\\n\\nIn a case where there's a specific set of types that are acceptable, oneof is a better way to go. Use an ActionMessage that can hold either an AddSymbolRequest or a RemoveSymbolRequest:\\n\\n```\\nmessage ActionMessage {\\n oneof action {\\n AddSymbolRequest add = 1;\\n RemoveSymbolRequest remove = 2;\\n }\\n}\\nmessage AddSymbolRequest {\\n string symbol = 1;\\n}\\nmessage RemoveSymbolRequest {\\n string symbol = 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nDeclare a bidirectional streaming service that takes a stream of Ac\", \"tionMessage messages:\\n\\n```\\nservice FullStockTicker {\\n rpc Subscribe (stream ActionMessage) returns (stream StockTickerUpdate);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe implementation for this service is similar to that of the previous example, except the first parameter of the Subscribe method is now an IAsyncStreamReader<ActionMessage>, which can be used to handle the Add and Remove requests:\\n\\n```\\npublic override async Task Subscribe(IAsyncStreamReader<ActionMessage> requestStream,\\nIServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)\\n{\\n using var subscriber = _subscriberFactory.GetSubscriber();\\n subscriber.Update += async (sender, args) =>\\n await WriteUpdateAsync(responseStream, args.Symbol, args.Price);\\n var actionsTask = HandleActions(requestStream, subscriber, context.CancellationToken);\\n _logger.LogInformation(\\\"Subscription started.\\\");\\n await AwaitCancellation(context.CancellationToken);\\n try { await actionsTask; } catch { /* Ignored */ }\\n _logger.LogInformation(\\\"Subscription finis\", \"hed.\\\");\\n}\\nprivate async Task WriteUpdateAsync(IServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate> stream, string\\nsymbol, decimal price)\\n{\\n try\\n {\\n await stream.WriteAsync(new StockTickerUpdate\\n {\\n Symbol = symbol,\\n PriceCents = (int)(price * 100),\\n Time = Timestamp.FromDateTimeOffset(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow)\\n });\\n }\\n catch (Exception e)\\n {\\n // Handle any errors caused by broken connection, etc.\\n _logger.LogError($\\\"Failed to write message: {e.Message}\\\");\\n }\\n}\\nprivate static Task AwaitCancellation(CancellationToken token)\\n{\\n var completion = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();\\n token.Register(() => completion.SetResult(null));\\n return completion.Task;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe ActionMessage class that gRPC has generated guarantees that only one of the Add and Remove properties can be set. Finding which one isn't null is a valid way to determine which type of message is used, but there's a better way. The code generation also created an enum ActionOneOfCase in the ActionMessage class, which looks like this:\\n\\n```\\npubli\", \"c enum ActionOneofCase {\\n None = 0,\\n Add = 1,\\n Remove = 2,\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe property ActionCase on the ActionMessage object can be used with a switch statement to determine which field is set:\\n\\n```\\nprivate async Task HandleActions(IAsyncStreamReader<ActionMessage> requestStream,\\nIFullStockPriceSubscriber subscriber, CancellationToken token)\\n{\\n await foreach (var action in requestStream.ReadAllAsync(token))\\n {\\n switch (action.ActionCase)\\n {\\n case ActionMessage.ActionOneofCase.None:\\n _logger.LogWarning(\\\"No Action specified.\\\");\\n break;\\n case ActionMessage.ActionOneofCase.Add:\\n subscriber.Add(action.Add.Symbol);\\n break;\\n case ActionMessage.ActionOneofCase.Remove:\\n subscriber.Remove(action.Remove.Symbol);\\n break;\\n default:\\n _logger.LogWarning($\\\"Unknown Action '{action.ActionCase}'.\\\");\\n break;\\n }\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Tip**\\n\\nThe switch statement has a default case that logs a warning if it encounters an unknown ActionOneOfCase value. This could be useful to indicate that a client is using a later versi\", \"on of the .proto file that has added more actions. This is one reason why using a switch is better than testing for null on known fields.\\n\\n#### **Use FullStockTickerService from a client application**\\n\\nThere's a simple .NET WPF application that demonstrates the use of this more complex client. You can find the full application on [GitHub.](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/main/FullStockTickerSample/grpc/FullStockTicker)\\n\\nThe client is used in the MainWindowViewModel class, which gets an instance of the FullStockTicker.FullStockTickerClient type from dependency injection:\\n\\n```\\npublic class MainWindowViewModel : IAsyncDisposable, INotifyPropertyChanged\\n{\\n private readonly FullStockTicker.FullStockTickerClient _client;\\n private readonly AsyncDuplexStreamingCall<ActionMessage, StockTickerUpdate>\\n_duplexStream;\\n private readonly CancellationTokenSource _cancellationTokenSource;\\n private readonly Task _responseTask;\\n private string _addSymbol;\\n public MainW\", \"indowViewModel(FullStockTicker.FullStockTickerClient client)\\n {\\n _cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();\\n _client = client;\\n _duplexStream = _client.Subscribe();\\n _responseTask = HandleResponsesAsync(_cancellationTokenSource.Token);\\n```\\n\\n```\\n AddCommand = new AsyncCommand(Add, CanAdd);\\n }\\n```\\n\\nThe object returned by the client.Subscribe() method is now an instance of the gRPC library type AsyncDuplexStreamingCall<TRequest, TResponse>, which provides a RequestStream for sending requests to the server and a ResponseStream for handling responses.\\n\\nThe request stream is used from some WPF ICommand methods to add and remove symbols. For each operation, set the relevant field on an ActionMessage object:\\n\\n```\\nprivate async Task Add()\\n{\\n if (CanAdd())\\n {\\n await _duplexStream.RequestStream.WriteAsync(new ActionMessage {Add = new\\nAddSymbolRequest {Symbol = AddSymbol}});\\n }\\n}\\npublic async Task Remove(PriceViewModel priceViewModel)\\n{\\n await _duplexStream.RequestStream.WriteAsync(\", \"new ActionMessage {Remove = new\\nRemoveSymbolRequest {Symbol = priceViewModel.Symbol}});\\n Prices.Remove(priceViewModel);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Important**\\n\\nSetting a oneof field's value on a message automatically clears any fields that have been set previously.\\n\\nThe stream of responses is handled in an async method. The Task it returns is held to be disposed when the window is closed:\\n\\n```\\nprivate async Task HandleResponsesAsync(CancellationToken token)\\n{\\n var stream = _duplexStream.ResponseStream;\\n try\\n {\\n await foreach (var update in stream.ReadAllAsync(token))\\n {\\n var price = Prices.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Symbol.Equals(update.Symbol));\\n if (price == null)\\n {\\n price = new PriceViewModel(this) {Symbol = update.Symbol, Price =\\nupdate.PriceCents / 100m};\\n Prices.Add(price);\\n }\\n else\\n {\\n price.Price = update.PriceCents / 100m;\\n }\\n }\\n }\\n```\\n\\n```\\n catch (OperationCancelledException) { }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Client cleanup**\\n\\nWhen the window is closed and the MainWindowViewModel is disposed (from the Closed\", \" event of MainWindow), we recommend that you properly dispose the AsyncDuplexStreamingCall object. In particular, the CompleteAsync method on the RequestStream should be called to gracefully close the stream on the server. This example shows the DisposeAsync method from the sample view-model:\\n\\n```\\npublic async ValueTask DisposeAsync()\\n{\\n try\\n {\\n await _duplexStream.RequestStream.CompleteAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);\\n await _responseTask.ConfigureAwait(false);\\n }\\n finally\\n {\\n _duplexStream.Dispose();\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nClosing request streams enables the server to dispose of its own resources in a timely way. This improves the efficiency and scalability of services and prevents exceptions.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-69-0\\\"></span>gRPC streaming services vs. repeated fields\\n\\ngRPC services provide two ways of returning datasets, or lists of objects. The Protocol Buffers message specification uses the repeated keyword for declaring lists or arrays of messages within another message. The gRPC service specifi\", \"cation uses the stream keyword to declare a long-running persistent connection. Over that connection, multiple messages are sent, and can be processed, individually.\\n\\nYou can also use the stream feature for long-running temporal data such as notifications or log messages. But this chapter will consider its use for returning a single dataset.\\n\\nWhich you should use depends on factors such as:\\n\\n- The overall size of the dataset.\\n- The time it took to create the dataset at either the client or server end.\\n- Whether the consumer of the dataset can start acting on it as soon as the first item is available, or needs the complete dataset to do anything useful.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-69-1\\\"></span>**When to use repeated fields**\\n\\nFor any dataset that's constrained in size and that can be generated in its entirety in a short time say, under one second\\u2014you should use a repeated field in a regular Protobuf message. For example, in an e-commerce system, to build a list of items within an order is probabl\", \"y quick and the list won't be very large. Returning a single message with a repeated field is an order of magnitude faster than using stream and incurs less network overhead.\\n\\nIf the client needs all the data before starting to process it and the dataset is small enough to construct in memory, then consider using a repeated field. Consider it even if the creation of the dataset in memory on the server is slower.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-70-0\\\"></span>**When to use stream methods**\\n\\nWhen the message objects in your datasets are potentially very large, it's best for you transfer them by using streaming requests or responses. It's more efficient to construct a large object in memory, write it to the network, and then free up the resources. This approach will improve the scalability of your service.\\n\\nSimilarly, you should send datasets of unconstrained size over streams to avoid running out of memory while constructing them.\\n\\nFor datasets where the consumer can separately process each item, you s\", \"hould consider using a stream if it means that progress can be indicated to the user. Using a stream can improve the responsiveness of an application, but you should balance it against the overall performance of the application.\\n\\nAnother scenario where streams can be useful is where a message is being processed across multiple services. If each service in a chain returns a stream, then the terminal service (that is, the last one in the chain) can start returning messages. These messages can be processed and passed back along the chain to the original requestor. The requestor can either return a stream or aggregate the results into a single response message. This approach lends itself well to patterns like MapReduce.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-70-1\\\"></span>Create gRPC client libraries\\n\\nIt isn't necessary to distribute client libraries for a gRPC application. You can create a shared library of .proto files within your organization, and other teams can use those files to generate client code in th\", \"eir own projects. But if you have a private NuGet repository and many other teams are using .NET, you can create and publish client NuGet packages as part of your service project. This approach can be a good way of sharing and promoting your service.\\n\\nOne advantage of distributing a client library is that you can enhance the generated gRPC and Protobuf classes with helpful \\\"convenience\\\" methods and properties. In the client code, as in the server, all the classes are declared as partial, so you can extend them without editing the generated code. This behavior means it's easy to add constructors, methods, and calculated properties to the basic types.\\n\\n#### **Caution**\\n\\nYou shouldn't use custom code to provide essential functionality. You don't want to restrict that essential functionality to .NET teams that use the shared library, and not provide it to teams that use other languages or platforms, such as Python or Java.\\n\\nEnsure that as many teams as possible can access your gRPC service\", \". The best way to do this functionality is to share .proto files so developers can generate their own clients. This approach is particularly true in a multi-platform environment, where different teams frequently use different programming languages and frameworks, or where your API is externally accessible.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-71-0\\\"></span>**Useful extensions**\\n\\nThere are two commonly used interfaces in .NET for dealing with streams of objects: [IEnumerable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1) and [IObservable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.iobservable-1). Starting with .NET Core 3.0 and C# 8.0, there's an [IAsyncEnumerable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.iasyncenumerable-1) interface for processing streams asynchronously, and an await foreach syntax for using the interface. This section presents reusable code for applying these interfaces to gRPC streams.\\n\\nWith the .NET gRPC client libraries, th\", \"ere's a ReadAllAsync extension method for IAsyncStreamReader<T> that creates an IAsyncEnumerable<T> interface. For developers using reactive programming, an equivalent extension method to create an IObservable<T> interface might look like the example in the following section.\\n\\n#### <span id=\\\"page-71-1\\\"></span>**IObservable**\\n\\nThe IObservable<T> interface is the \\\"reactive\\\" inverse of IEnumerable<T>. Rather than pulling items from a stream, the reactive approach lets the stream push items to a subscriber. This behavior is very similar to gRPC streams, and it's easy to wrap an IObservable<T> interface around an IAsyncStreamReader<T> interface.\\n\\nThis code is longer than the IAsyncEnumerable<T> code, because C# doesn't have built-in support for working with observables. You have to create the implementation class manually. It's a generic class, though, so a single implementation works across all types.\\n\\n```\\nnamespace Grpc.Core;\\npublic class GrpcStreamObservable<T> : IObservable<T>\\n{\\n privat\", \"e readonly IAsyncStreamReader<T> _reader;\\n private readonly CancellationToken _token;\\n private int _used;\\n public GrpcStreamObservable(IAsyncStreamReader<T> reader, CancellationToken token =\\ndefault)\\n {\\n _reader = reader ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(reader));\\n _token = token;\\n _used = 0;\\n }\\n public IDisposable Subscribe(IObserver<T> observer) =>\\n Interlocked.Exchange(ref _used, 1) == 0\\n ? new GrpcStreamSubscription<T>(_reader, observer, _token)\\n : throw new InvalidOperationException(\\\"Subscribe can only be called once.\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Important**\\n\\nThis observable implementation allows the Subscribe method to be called only once, because having multiple subscribers trying to read from the stream would result in chaos. There are operators, such as Replay in the [System.Reactive.Linq,](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Reactive.Linq) that enable buffering and repeatable sharing of observables, which can be used with this implementation.\\n\\nThe GrpcStreamSubscription class h\", \"andles the enumeration of the IAsyncStreamReader:\\n\\n```\\npublic class GrpcStreamSubscription<T> : IDisposable\\n{\\n private readonly IAsyncStreamReader<T> _reader;\\n private readonly IObserver<T> _observer;\\n private readonly CancellationTokenSource _tokenSource;\\n private readonly Task _task;\\n private bool _completed;\\n public GrpcStreamSubscription(IAsyncStreamReader<T> reader, IObserver<T> observer,\\nCancellationToken token = default)\\n {\\n _reader = reader ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(reader));\\n _observer = observer ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(observer));\\n _tokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();\\n token.Register(_tokenSource.Cancel);\\n _task = Run(_tokenSource.Token);\\n }\\n private async Task Run(CancellationToken token)\\n {\\n while (!token.IsCancellationRequested)\\n {\\n try\\n {\\n if (!await _reader.MoveNext(token)) break;\\n }\\n catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode == Grpc.Core.StatusCode.NotFound)\\n {\\n break;\\n }\\n catch (OperationCanceledException)\\n {\\n break;\\n }\\n catch\", \" (Exception e)\\n {\\n _observer.OnError(e);\\n _completed = true;\\n return;\\n }\\n _observer.OnNext(_reader.Current);\\n }\\n _completed = true;\\n```\\n\\n```\\n _observer.OnCompleted();\\n }\\n public void Dispose()\\n {\\n if (!_completed && !_tokenSource.IsCancellationRequested)\\n {\\n _tokenSource.Cancel();\\n }\\n _tokenSource.Dispose();\\n _task.Dispose();\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAll that is required now is a simple extension method to create the observable from the stream reader.\\n\\n```\\nnamespace Grpc.Core;\\npublic static class AsyncStreamReaderObservableExtensions\\n{\\n public static IObservable<T> AsObservable<T>(\\n this IAsyncStreamReader<T> reader,\\n CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) =>\\n new GrpcStreamObservable<T>(reader, cancellationToken);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-73-0\\\"></span>**Summary**\\n\\nThe [IAsyncEnumerable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.iasyncenumerable-1) and [IObservable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.iobservable-1) models are both well-supported and well-docum\", \"ented ways of dealing with asynchronous streams of data in .NET. gRPC streams map well to both paradigms, offering close integration with .NET, and reactive and asynchronous programming styles.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-74-0\\\"></span>Security in gRPC applications\\n\\nIn any real-world scenario, securing applications and services are essential. Security covers three key areas:\\n\\n- Encrypting network traffic to prevent malicious hackers from intercepting it.\\n- Authenticating clients and servers to establish identity and trust.\\n- Authorizing clients to control access to systems and apply permissions based on identity.\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\n*Authentication* is concerned with establishing the identity of a client or server. *Authorization* is concerned with determining whether a client has permission to access a resource or issue a command.\\n\\nThis chapter will cover the facilities for authentication and authorization in gRPC for ASP.NET Core. It will also discuss network security through TLS encrypted connecti\", \"ons.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-74-1\\\"></span>WCF authentication and authorization\\n\\nIn Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), authentication and authorization were handled in different ways, depending on the transports and bindings being used. WCF supported various WS-\\\\* security standards. It also supported Windows authentication for HTTP services running in IIS or NetTCP services between Windows systems.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-74-2\\\"></span>gRPC authentication and authorization\\n\\ngRPC authentication and authorization works on two levels:\\n\\n- Call-level authentication/authorization is usually handled through tokens that are applied in metadata when the call is made.\\n- Channel-level authentication uses a client certificate that's applied at the connection level. It can also include call-level authentication/authorization credentials to be applied to every call on the channel automatically.\\n\\nYou can use either or both of these mechanisms to help secure your service.\\n\\nThe ASP.NET Core implementation of g\", \"RPC supports authentication and authorization through most of the standard ASP.NET Core mechanisms:\\n\\n- Call authentication\\n  - Azure Active Directory\\n  - IdentityServer\\n  - JWT Bearer Token\\n  - OAuth 2.0\\n  - OpenID Connect\\n  - WS-Federation\\n- Channel authentication\\n  - Client certificate\\n\\nThe call authentication methods are all based on *tokens*. The only real difference is how the tokens are generated and the libraries that are used to validate the tokens in the ASP.NET Core service.\\n\\nFor more information, see the [Authentication and authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/authn-and-authz) article.\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nWhen you're using gRPC over a TLS-encrypted HTTP/2 connection, all traffic between clients and servers is encrypted, even if you don't use channel-level authentication.\\n\\nThis chapter will show how to apply call credentials and channel credentials to a gRPC service. It will also show how to use credentials from a .NET gRPC client to authenticate with the se\", \"rvice.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-75-0\\\"></span>Call credentials\\n\\nCall credentials are all based on a token passed in metadata with each request.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-75-1\\\"></span>**WS-Federation**\\n\\nASP.NET Core supports WS-Federation using the [WsFederation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.WsFederation) NuGet package. WS-Federation is the closest available alternative to Windows Authentication, which isn't supported over HTTP/2. Users are authenticated by using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), which provides a token that can be used to authenticate with ASP.NET Core.\\n\\nFor more information on how to get started with this authentication method, see [Authenticate users](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authentication/ws-federation)  [with WS-Federation in ASP.NET Core.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authentication/ws-federation)\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-75-2\\\"></span>**JWT Bearer tokens**\\n\\nThe [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/)\", \" (JWT) standard provides a way to encode information about a user and their claims in an encoded string. It also provides a way to sign that token, so that the consumer can verify the integrity of the token by using public key cryptography. You can use various services, such as IdentityServer4, to authenticate users and generate OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens to use with gRPC and HTTP APIs.\\n\\nASP.NET Core 7.0 can handle JWTs by using the JWT Bearer package. The configuration is exactly the same for a gRPC application as it is for an ASP.NET Core MVC application. Here, we'll focus on JWT Bearer tokens, because they're easier to develop with than WS-Federation.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-76-0\\\"></span>**Add authentication and authorization to the server**\\n\\nThe JWT Bearer package isn't included in ASP.NET Core 7.0 by default. Install the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer) NuGet package in your app.\\n\\nAdd the Aut\", \"hentication service in the *Program.cs* class, and configure the JWT Bearer handler:\\n\\n```\\n//\\n//\\nbuilder.Services.AddGrpc();\\nvar signingKey = ObtainSigningKeySomehow();\\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\\n .AddJwtBearer(options =>\\n {\\n options.TokenValidationParameters =\\n new TokenValidationParameters\\n {\\n ValidateAudience = false,\\n ValidateIssuer = false,\\n ValidateActor = false,\\n ValidateLifetime = true,\\n IssuerSigningKey = signingKey\\n };\\n });\\n//\\n//\\n```\\n\\nThe IssuerSigningKey property requires an implementation of\\n\\nMicrosoft.IdentityModels.Tokens.SecurityKey with the cryptographic data necessary to validate the signed tokens. Store this token securely in a *secrets server*, like Azure Key Vault.\\n\\nNext, add the Authorization service, which controls access to the system:\\n\\n```\\n services.AddAuthorization(options =>\\n {\\n options.AddPolicy(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, policy =>\\n {\\n policy.AddAuthenticationSchemes(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationS\", \"cheme);\\n policy.RequireClaim(ClaimTypes.Name);\\n });\\n });\\n```\\n\\n#### **Tip**\\n\\nAuthentication and authorization are two separate steps. You use authentication to determine the user's identity. You use authorization to decide whether that user is allowed to access various parts of the system.\\n\\nNow add the authentication and authorization middleware to the ASP.NET Core pipeline in the *Program.cs*:\\n\\n```\\n//\\n app.UseRouting();\\n // Authenticate, then Authorize\\n app.UseAuthentication();\\n app.UseAuthorization();\\n app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>\\n {\\n endpoints.MapGrpcService<PortfolioService>();\\n });\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFinally, apply the [Authorize] attribute to any services or methods to be secured, and use the User property from the underlying HttpContext to verify permissions.\\n\\n```\\n[Authorize]\\npublic override async Task<GetResponse> Get(GetRequest request, ServerCallContext context)\\n{\\n if (!TryValidateUser(request.TraderId, context.GetHttpContext().User))\\n {\\n throw new RpcException(new Status(StatusCode.Perm\", \"issionDenied, \\\"Denied.\\\"));\\n }\\n var portfolio = await _repository.GetAsync(traderId, request.PortfolioId);\\n return new GetResponse\\n {\\n Portfolio = Portfolio.FromRepositoryModel(portfolio)\\n };\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-77-0\\\"></span>**Provide call credentials in the client application**\\n\\nAfter you've obtained a JWT token from an identity server, you can use it to authenticate gRPC calls from the client by adding it as a metadata header on the call, as follows:\\n\\n```\\npublic async Task ShowPortfolioAsync(int portfolioId)\\n{\\n var headers = new Grpc.Core.Metadata\\n {\\n { \\\"Authorization\\\", $\\\"Bearer {_userToken}\\\" }\\n };\\n var request = new GetRequest\\n {\\n TraderId = _userId,\\n PortfolioId = portfolioId\\n };\\n var response = await _portfoliosClient.GetAsync(request, headers);\\n // Display portfolio\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow you've secured your gRPC service by using JWT bearer tokens as call credentials. A version of the [portfolios sample gRPC application with authentication and authorization added](https://github.com/dotne\", \"t-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/main/PortfoliosSample/grpc/TraderSysAuth) is on GitHub.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-78-0\\\"></span>Channel credentials\\n\\nAs the name implies, channel credentials are attached to the underlying gRPC channel. The standard form of channel credentials uses client certificate authentication. In this process, the client provides a TLS certificate when it's making the connection, and then the server verifies this certificate before allowing any calls to be made.\\n\\nYou can combine channel credentials with call credentials to provide comprehensive security for a gRPC service. The channel credentials prove that the client application is allowed to access the service, and the call credentials provide information about the person who is using the client application.\\n\\nClient certificate authentication works for gRPC the same way it works for ASP.NET Core. For more information, see [Configure certificate authentication in ASP.NET Core.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet\", \"/core/security/authentication/certauth)\\n\\nFor development purposes you can use a self-signed certificate, but for production you should use a proper HTTPS certificate signed by a trusted authority.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-78-1\\\"></span>**Add certificate authentication to the server**\\n\\nConfigure certificate authentication both at the host level (for example, on the Kestrel server), and in the ASP.NET Core pipeline.\\n\\n#### **Configure certificate validation on Kestrel**\\n\\nYou can configure Kestrel (the ASP.NET Core HTTP server) to require a client certificate, and optionally to carry out some validation of the supplied certificate, before accepting incoming connections. You specify this configuration in the *Program.cs*:\\n\\n```\\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\\nvar serverCert = ObtainServerCertificate();\\nbuilder.WebHost.UseKestrel(kestrelServerOptions => {\\n kestrelServerOptions.ConfigureHttpsDefaults(opt =>\\n {\\n opt.ClientCertificateMode = ClientCertificateMode.RequireCertificate;\\n /\", \"/ Verify that client certificate was issued by same CA as server certificate\\n opt.ClientCertificateValidation = (certificate, chain, errors) =>\\n certificate.Issuer == serverCert.Issuer;\\n });\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe ClientCertificateMode.RequireCertificate setting causes Kestrel to immediately reject any connection request that doesn't provide a client certificate, but this setting by itself won't validate a certificate that is provided. Add the ClientCertificateValidation callback to enable Kestrel to validate the client certificate at the point the connection is made, before the ASP.NET Core pipeline is engaged. (In this case, the callback ensures that it was issued by the same *Certificate Authority* as the server certificate.)\\n\\n#### **Add ASP.NET Core certificate authentication**\\n\\nThe [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Certificate) NuGet package provides certificate authentication.\\n\\nAdd the certificate authentica\", \"tion service in the *Program.cs*, and add authentication and authorization to the ASP.NET Core pipeline.\\n\\n```\\n//\\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication(CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\\n .AddCertificate(options =>\\n {\\n options.AllowedCertificateTypes = CertificateTypes.Chained;\\n options.RevocationMode = X509RevocationMode.NoCheck;\\n options.Events = new CertificateAuthenticationEvents\\n {\\n OnCertificateValidated = DevelopmentModeCertificateHelper.Validate\\n };\\n });\\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthorization();\\nbuilder.Services.AddGrpc();\\nvar app = builder.Build();\\n// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.\\napp.UseRouting();\\napp.UseAuthentication();\\napp.UseEndpoints(endpoints => { endpoints.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>(); });\\n//\\n```\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-79-0\\\"></span>**Provide channel credentials in the client application**\\n\\nWith the Grpc.Net.Client package, you configure certificates on an [HttpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) instance that is \", \"provided to the GrpcChannel used for the connection.\\n\\n#### **Load a client certificate from a .PFX file**\\n\\nA certificate can be loaded from a *.pfx* file.\\n\\n```\\nclass Program\\n{\\n static async Task Main(string[] args)\\n {\\n // Assume path to a client .pfx file and password are passed from command line\\n // On Windows this would probably be a reference to the Certificate Store\\n var cert = new X509Certificate2(args[0], args[1]);\\n var handler = new HttpClientHandler();\\n handler.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);\\n var httpClient = new HttpClient(handler);\\n var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(\\\"https://localhost:5001/\\\", new\\nGrpcChannelOptions\\n {\\n HttpClient = httpClient\\n```\\n\\n```\\n });\\n var grpc = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);\\n var response = await grpc.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = \\\"Bob\\\" });\\n System.Console.WriteLine(response.Message);\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Load a client certificate from certificate and private key .PEM files**\\n\\nA certificate can be loaded from a certificate and private key \", \"*.pem* file.\\n\\n```\\nclass Program\\n{\\n static async Task Main(string[] args)\\n {\\n // Assume path to a certificate and private key .pem files are passed from command \\nline\\n string certificatePem = File.ReadAllText(args[0]);\\n string privateKeyPem = File.ReadAllText(args[1]);\\n var cert = X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem(certificatePem, privateKeyPem);\\n var handler = new HttpClientHandler();\\n handler.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);\\n using HttpClient httpClient = new(handler);\\n var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(\\\"https://localhost:5001/\\\", new\\nGrpcChannelOptions\\n {\\n HttpClient = httpClient\\n });\\n var grpc = new Greeter.GreeterClient(channel);\\n var response = await grpc.SayHelloAsync(new HelloRequest { Name = \\\"Bob\\\" });\\n System.Console.WriteLine(response.Message);\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nDue to an internal Windows bug as [documented here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/23749#issuecomment-388231655), you'll need to apply the following workaround if the certificate is created from a certifica\", \"te and private key PEM data.\\n\\n]{custom-style=Code}`csharp X509Certificate2 cert = X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem(certificatePem, rsaPrivateKeyPem); if (RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Windows)) { var originalCert = cert; cert = new X509Certificate2(cert.Export(X509ContentType.Pkcs12)); originalCert.Dispose(); } [`\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-80-0\\\"></span>**Combine ChannelCredentials and CallCredentials**\\n\\nYou can configure your server to use both certificate and token authentication.

Or you can run it as a Linux service controlled by [systemd,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) because of features introduced in the .NET 6 hosting extensions.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-83-2\\\"></span>**Run your app as a Windows service**\\n\\nTo configure your ASP.NET Core application to run as a Windows service, install the [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices) package from NuGet. Then add a call to UseWindowsService to the CreateHostBuilder method in Program.cs.\\n\\n```\\nHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\\n .UseWindowsService()\\n ...\\n```\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nIf the applica\", \"tion isn't running as a Windows service, the UseWindowsService method doesn't do anything.\\n\\nNow publish your application by using one of these methods:\\n\\n- From Visual Studio by right-clicking the project and selecting **Publish** on the shortcut menu.\\n- From the .NET CLI.\\n\\nWhen you publish a .NET application, you can choose to create a *framework-dependent* deployment or a *self-contained* deployment. Framework-dependent deployments require the .NET Shared Runtime to be installed on the host where they're run. Self-contained deployments are published with a complete copy of the .NET runtime and framework and can be run on any host. For more information,\\n\\nincluding the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, see the [.NET application deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/) documentation.\\n\\nTo publish a self-contained build of the application that doesn't require the .NET 5 runtime to be installed on the host, specify the runtime to be included with the appli\", \"cation. Use the -r (or --runtime) flag.\\n\\n```\\ndotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -o ./publish\\n```\\n\\nTo publish a framework-dependent build, omit the -r flag.\\n\\n```\\ndotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish\\n```\\n\\nCopy the complete contents of the publish directory to an installation folder. Then, use the [sc tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/services/controlling-a-service-using-sc) to create a Windows service for the executable file.\\n\\n```\\nsc create MyService binPath=C:\\\\MyService\\\\MyService.exe\\n```\\n\\n#### **Log to the Windows event log**\\n\\nThe UseWindowsService method automatically adds a [logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/) provider that writes log messages to the Windows event log. You can configure logging for this provider by adding an EventLog entry to the Logging section of appsettings.json or another configuration source.\\n\\nYou can override the source name used in the event log by setting a SourceName property in these settings. If you don'\", \"t specify a name, the default application name (normally the executable assembly name) will be used.\\n\\nMore information on logging is at the end of this chapter.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-84-0\\\"></span>**Run your app as a Linux service with systemd**\\n\\nTo configure your ASP.NET Core application to run as a Linux service (or *daemon* in Linux parlance), install the [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Systemd](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Systemd) package from NuGet. Then add a call to UseSystemd to the CreateHostBuilder method in Program.cs.\\n\\n```\\npublic static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>\\n Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\\n .UseSystemd() // Enable running as a Systemd service\\n .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>\\n {\\n ...\\n });\\n```\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nIf the application isn't running as a Linux service, the UseSystemd method doesn't do anything.\\n\\nNow publish your application. The application can be either framework dependent or self-contained for the r\", \"elevant Linux runtime (for example, linux-x64). You can publish by using one of these methods:\\n\\n- From Visual Studio by right-clicking the project and selecting **Publish** on the shortcut menu.\\n- From the .NET CLI, by using the following command:\\n\\n```\\ndotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 -o ./publish\\n```\\n\\nCopy the complete contents of the publish directory to an installation folder on the Linux host. Registering the service requires a special file, called a *unit file*, to be added to the /etc/systemd/system directory. You'll need root permission to create a file in this folder. Name the file with the identifier that you want systemd to use and the .service extension. For example, use /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service.\\n\\nThe service file uses INI format, as shown in this example:\\n\\n```\\n[Unit]\\nDescription=My gRPC Application\\n[Service]\\nType=notify\\nExecStart=/usr/sbin/myapp\\n[Install]\\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\\n```\\n\\nThe Type=notify property tells systemd that the application will notify i\", \"t on startup and shutdown. The WantedBy=multi-user.target setting will cause the service to start when the Linux system reaches \\\"runlevel 2,\\\" which means a nongraphical, multi-user shell is active.\\n\\nBefore systemd will recognize the service, it needs to reload its configuration. You control systemd by using the systemctl command. After reloading, use the status subcommand to confirm that the application has registered successfully.\\n\\n```\\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\\nsudo systemctl status myapp\\n```\\n\\nIf you've configured the service correctly, you'll get the following output:\\n\\n```\\nmyapp.service - My gRPC Application\\n Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/myapp.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)\\n Active: inactive (dead)\\n```\\n\\nUse the start command to start the service.\\n\\n```\\nsudo systemctl start myapp.service\\n```\\n\\n#### **Tip**\\n\\nThe .service extension is optional when you're using systemctl start.\\n\\nTo tell systemd to start the service automatically on system startup, use the enable comm\", \"and.\\n\\n```\\nsudo systemctl enable myapp\\n```\\n\\n#### **Log to journald**\\n\\nThe Linux equivalent of the Windows event log is journald, a structured logging system service that's part of systemd. Log messages written to the standard output by a Linux daemon are automatically written to journald. To configure logging levels, use the Console section of the logging configuration. The UseSystemd host builder method automatically configures the console output format to suit the journal.\\n\\nBecause journald is the standard for Linux logs, a variety of tools integrate with it. You can easily route logs from journald to an external logging system. Working locally on the host, you can use the journalctl command to view logs from the command line.\\n\\n```\\nsudo journalctl -u myapp\\n```\\n\\n#### **Tip**\\n\\nIf you have a GUI environment available on your host, a few graphical log viewers are available for Linux, such as *QJournalctl* and *gnome-logs*.\\n\\nTo learn more about querying the systemd journal from the command\", \" line by using journalctl, see [the](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/systemd/journalctl.1)  [manpages.](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/systemd/journalctl.1)\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-86-0\\\"></span>**HTTPS certificates for self-hosted applications**\\n\\nWhen you're running a gRPC application in production, you should use a TLS certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA). This CA might be a public CA, or an internal one for your organization.\\n\\nOn Windows hosts, you can load the certificate from a secure [certificate store](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/seccrypto/managing-certificates-with-certificate-stores) by using the [X509Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509store) class. You can also use the X509Store class with the OpenSSL key store on some Linux hosts.\\n\\nYou can also create certificates by using one of the [X509Certificate2 constructors,](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.x50\", \"9certificates.x509certificate2.-ctor) from either:\\n\\n- A file, such as a .pfx file protected by a strong password\\n- Binary data retrieved from a secure storage service such as [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/)\\n\\nYou can configure Kestrel to use a certificate in two ways: from configuration or in code.\\n\\n### **Set HTTPS certificates by using configuration**\\n\\nThe configuration approach requires setting the password and path to the certificate .pfx file in the Kestrel configuration section. In appsettings.json, that looks like this:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n \\\"Kestrel\\\": {\\n \\\"Certificates\\\": {\\n \\\"Default\\\": {\\n \\\"Path\\\": \\\"cert.pfx\\\",\\n \\\"Password\\\": \\\"DO NOT STORE PLAINTEXT PASSWORDS IN APPSETTINGS FILES\\\"\\n }\\n }\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nProvide the password by using a secure configuration source such as Azure Key Vault or Hashicorp Vault.\\n\\n#### **Important**\\n\\nDon't store unencrypted passwords in configuration files.\\n\\n#### **Set HTTPS certificates in code**\\n\\nTo configure HTTPS on Kestrel in code, use the Co\", \"nfigureKestrel method on IWebHostBuilder in the Program class.\\n\\n```\\npublic static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>\\n Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\\n .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>\\n {\\n webBuilder.ConfigureKestrel(kestrel =>\\n {\\n kestrel.ConfigureHttpsDefaults(https =>\\n {\\n https.ServerCertificate = new X509Certificate2(\\\"mycert.pfx\\\",\\n\\\"password\\\");\\n });\\n });\\n });\\n```\\n\\nAgain, be sure to store the password for the .pfx file in, and retrieve it from, a secure configuration source.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-87-0\\\"></span>Create Docker images\\n\\nThis section covers the creation of Docker images for ASP.NET Core gRPC applications, ready to run in Docker, Kubernetes, or other container environments. The sample application used, with an ASP.NET Core MVC web app and a gRPC service, is available on the [dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/main/KubernetesSample)[developers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wc\", \"f-developers/tree/main/KubernetesSample) repository on GitHub.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-87-1\\\"></span>**Microsoft base images for ASP.NET Core applications**\\n\\nMicrosoft provides a range of base images for building and running .NET applications. To create an ASP.NET Core 7.0 image, you use two base images:\\n\\n- An SDK image to build and publish the application.\\n- A runtime image for deployment.\\n\\n| Image                       | Description                                                    |\\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sd | For building applications with docker build. Not to be used in |\\n| k                           | production.                                                    |\\n| mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/as | Contains the runtime and ASP.NET Core dependencies. For        |\\n| pnet                        | production.                                                    |\\n\\nFor each image, there are fou\", \"r variants based on different Linux distributions, distinguished by tags.\\n\\n| Image tag(s)           | Linux       | Notes                                                                 |\\n|------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| 7.0-bullseye-slim, 7.0 | Debian 11   | The default image if no<br>OS variant is specified.                   |\\n| 7.0-alpine             | Alpine 3.17 | Alpine base images are<br>much smaller than<br>Debian or Ubuntu ones. |\\n\\nThe Alpine base image is around 100 MB, compared to 200 MB for the Debian and Ubuntu images. Some software packages or libraries might not be available in Alpine's package management. If you're not sure which image to use, you should probably choose the default Debian.\\n\\n#### **Important**\\n\\nMake sure you use the same variant of Linux for the build and the runtime. Applications built and published on one variant might not work on another.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-88-0\\\"></span\", \">**Create a Docker image**\\n\\nA Docker image is defined by a *Dockerfile*. This *Dockerfile* is a text file that contains all the commands needed to build the application and install any dependencies that are required for either building or running the application. The following example shows the simplest Dockerfile for an ASP.NET Core 7.0 application:\\n\\n```\\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 as build\\nWORKDIR /src\\nCOPY ./StockKube.sln .\\nCOPY ./src/StockData/StockData.csproj ./src/StockData/\\nCOPY ./src/StockWeb/StockWeb.csproj ./src/StockWeb/\\nRUN dotnet restore\\nCOPY . .\\nRUN dotnet publish --no-restore -c Release -o /published src/StockData/StockData.csproj\\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 as runtime\\n# Uncomment the line below if running with HTTPS\\n# ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+:443\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY --from=build /published .\\nENTRYPOINT [ \\\"dotnet\\\", \\\"StockData.dll\\\" ]\\n```\\n\\nThe Dockerfile has two parts: the first uses the sdk base image to build and publish the application; the sec\", \"ond creates a runtime image from the aspnet base. This is because the sdk image is around 900 MB, compared to around 200 MB for the runtime image, and most of its contents are unnecessary at run time.\\n\\n#### **The build steps**\\n\\n| Step               | Description                                                                                           |\\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| FROM               | Declares the base image and assigns the builder alias.                                                |\\n| WORKDIR /src       | Creates the /src directory and sets it as the current working directory.                              |\\n| COPY               | Copies everything below the current directory on the host into the<br>current directory on the image. |\\n| RUN dotnet restore | Restores any external packages (ASP.NET Core 3.0 framework is<br>preinstalled with the SDK).          |\\n| RUN dotn\", \"et publish | Builds and publishes a Release build. Theruntime flag isn't required.                                 |\\n\\n#### **The runtime image steps**\\n\\n| Step             | Description                                                                                                           |\\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| FROM             | Declares a new base image.                                                                                            |\\n| WORKDIR /app     | Creates the /app directory and sets it as the current working directory.                                              |\\n| COPYfrom=builder | Copies the published application from the previous image, by using the<br>builder alias from the first FROM line.     |\\n| ENTRYPOINT [ ]   | Sets the command to run when the container starts. The dotnet<br>command in the runtime image can only run DLL files. |\\n\\n#\", \"### **HTTPS in Docker**\\n\\nMicrosoft base images for Docker set the ASPNETCORE\\\\_URLS environment variable to http://+:80, meaning that Kestrel runs without HTTPS on that port. If you're using HTTPS with a custom certificate (as described in [Self-hosted gRPC applications\\\\)](#page-83-1), you should override this configuration. Set the environment variable in the runtime image creation part of your Dockerfile.\\n\\n```\\n# Runtime image creation\\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0\\n```\\n\\n**ENV** ASPNETCORE\\\\_URLS=https://+:443\\n\\n## **The .dockerignore file**\\n\\nMuch like .gitignore files that exclude certain files and directories from source control, the .dockerignore file can be used to exclude files and directories from being copied to the image during build. This file not only saves time copying, but can also avoid some errors that arise from having the obj directory from your PC copied into the image. At a minimum, you should add entries for bin and obj to your .dockerignore file.\\n\\nbin/ obj/\\n\", \"\\n## <span id=\\\"page-90-0\\\"></span>**Build the image**\\n\\nFor a StockKube.sln solution containing two different applications StockData and StockWeb, it's simplest to put the Dockerfile for each one of them in the base directory. In that case, to build the image, use the following docker build command from the same directory where .sln file resides.\\n\\n```\\ndocker build -t stockdata:1.0.0 -f ./src/StockData/Dockerfile .\\n```\\n\\nThe confusingly named --tag flag (which can be shortened to -t) specifies the whole name of the image, including the actual tag if specified. The . at the end specifies the context in which the build will be run; the current working directory for the COPY commands in the Dockerfile.\\n\\nIf you have multiple applications within a single solution, you can keep the Dockerfile for each application in its own folder, beside the .csproj file. You should still run the docker build command from the base directory to ensure that the solution and all the projects are copied into the ima\", \"ge. You can specify a Dockerfile below the current directory by using the --file (or -f) flag.\\n\\ndocker build -t stockdata:1.0.0 -f ./src/StockData/Dockerfile .\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-90-1\\\"></span>**Run the image in a container on your machine**\\n\\nTo run the image in your local Docker instance, use the docker run command.\\n\\n```\\ndocker run -ti -p 5000:80 stockdata:1.0.0\\n```\\n\\nThe -ti flag connects your current terminal to the container's terminal, and runs in interactive mode. The -p 5000:80 publishes (links) port 80 on the container to port 5000 on the localhost network interface.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-90-2\\\"></span>**Push the image to a registry**\\n\\nAfter you've verified that the image works, push it to a Docker registry to make it available on other systems. Internal networks will need to provision a Docker registry. This activity can be as simple as running [Docker's own](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) registry image (the Docker registry runs in a Docker container), but there are va\", \"rious more comprehensive solutions available. For external sharing and cloud use, there are various managed registries available, such as [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) or [Docker Hub.](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/)\\n\\nTo push to Docker Hub, prefix the image name with your user or organization name.\\n\\n```\\ndocker tag stockdata:1.0.0 <myorg>/stockdata:1.0.0\\ndocker push <myorg>/stockdata:1.0.0\\n```\\n\\nTo push to a private registry, prefix the image name with the registry host name and the organization name.\\n\\n```\\ndocker tag stockdata <internal-registry:5000>/<myorg>/stockdata:1.0.0\\ndocker push <internal-registry:5000>/<myorg>/stockdata:1.0.0\\n```\\n\\nAfter the image is in a registry, you can deploy it to individual Docker hosts, or to a container orchestration engine like Kubernetes.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-91-0\\\"></span>Kubernetes\\n\\nAlthough it's possible to run containers manually on Docker hosts, for reliable production systems it's better to\", \" use a container orchestration engine to manage multiple instances running across several servers in a cluster. There are various container orchestration engines available, including Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos. But of these engines, Kubernetes is far and away the most widely used, so it will be the focus of this chapter.\\n\\nKubernetes includes the following functionality:\\n\\n- **Scheduling** runs containers on multiple nodes within a cluster, ensuring balanced usage of the available resource, keeping containers running if there are outages, and handling rolling updates to new versions of images or new configurations.\\n- **Health checks** monitor containers to ensure continued service.\\n- **DNS & service discovery** handles routing between services within a cluster.\\n- **Ingress** exposes selected services externally and generally provides load-balancing across instances of those services.\\n- **Resource management** attaches external resources like storage to containers.\\n\\nThis c\", \"hapter will detail how to deploy an ASP.NET Core gRPC service and a website that consumes the service into a Kubernetes cluster. The sample application used is available in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/main/KubernetesSample)[architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/main/KubernetesSample) repository on GitHub.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-91-1\\\"></span>**Kubernetes terminology**\\n\\nKubernetes uses *desired state configuration*: the API is used to describe objects like *Pods*, *Deployments*, and *Services*, and the *Control Plane* takes care of implementing the desired state across all the *nodes* in a *cluster*. A Kubernetes cluster has a *Master* node that runs the *Kubernetes API*, which you can communicate with programmatically or by using the kubectl command-line tool. kubectl can create and manage objects through command-line arguments, but it works best with YAML files that cont\", \"ain declaration data for Kubernetes objects.\\n\\n#### **Kubernetes YAML files**\\n\\nEvery Kubernetes YAML file will have at least three top-level properties:\\n\\n```\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Namespace\\nmetadata:\\n # Object properties\\n```\\n\\nThe apiVersion property is used to specify which version (and which API) the file is intended for. The kind property specifies the kind of object the YAML represents. The metadata property contains object properties like name, namespace, and labels.\\n\\nMost Kubernetes YAML files will also have a spec section that describes the resources and configuration necessary to create the object.\\n\\n#### **Pods**\\n\\nPods are the basic units of execution in Kubernetes. They can run multiple containers, but they're also used to run single containers. The pod also includes any storage resources required by the containers, and the network IP address.\\n\\n#### **Services**\\n\\nServices are meta-objects that describe Pods (or sets of Pods) and provide a way to access them within the cluster, su\", \"ch as mapping a service name to a set of pod IP addresses by using the cluster DNS service.\\n\\n#### **Deployments**\\n\\nDeployments are the *desired state* objects for Pods. If you create a pod manually, it won't be restarted when it terminates. Deployments are used to tell the cluster which Pods, and how many replicas of those Pods, should be running at the present time.\\n\\n### **Other objects**\\n\\nPods, Services, and Deployments are just three of the most basic object types. There are dozens of other object types that are managed by Kubernetes clusters. For more information, see the [Kubernetes Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/) documentation.\\n\\n#### **Namespaces**\\n\\nKubernetes clusters are designed to scale to hundreds or thousands of nodes and to run similar numbers of services. To avoid clashes between object names, namespaces are used to group objects together as part of larger applications. Kubernetes's own services run in a default namespace. All user objects should be create\", \"d in their own namespaces to avoid potential clashes with default objects or other tenants in the cluster.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-92-0\\\"></span>**Get started with Kubernetes**\\n\\nIf you're running Docker Desktop for Windows or Docker Desktop for Mac, Kubernetes is already available. Just enable it in the **Kubernetes** section of the **Settings** window:\\n\\n![](_page_93_Figure_0.jpeg)\\n\\nTo run a local Kubernetes cluster on Linux, consider [minikube,](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) or [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) if your Linux distribution supports [snaps.](https://snapcraft.io/)\\n\\nTo confirm that your cluster is running and accessible, run the kubectl version command:\\n\\n```\\nkubectl version\\nClient Version: version.Info{Major:\\\"1\\\", Minor:\\\"19\\\", GitVersion:\\\"v1.19.3\\\", \\nGitCommit:\\\"1e11e4a2108024935ecfcb2912226cedeafd99df\\\", GitTreeState:\\\"clean\\\", \\nBuildDate:\\\"2020-10-14T12:50:19Z\\\", GoVersion:\\\"go1.15.2\\\", Compiler:\\\"gc\\\", \\nPlatform:\\\"windows/amd64\\\"}\\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\\\"1\\\", Minor:\\\"19\\\"\", \", GitVersion:\\\"v1.19.3\\\", \\nGitCommit:\\\"1e11e4a2108024935ecfcb2912226cedeafd99df\\\", GitTreeState:\\\"clean\\\", \\nBuildDate:\\\"2020-10-14T12:41:49Z\\\", GoVersion:\\\"go1.15.2\\\", Compiler:\\\"gc\\\", \\nPlatform:\\\"linux/amd64\\\"}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, both the kubectl CLI and the Kubernetes server are running version 1.14.6. Each version of kubectl is supposed to support the previous and next version of the server, so kubectl 1.14 should work with server versions 1.13 and 1.15 as well.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-93-0\\\"></span>**Run services on Kubernetes**\\n\\nThe sample application has a kube directory that contains three YAML files. The namespace.yml file declares a custom namespace: stocks. The stockdata.yml file declares the Deployment and the Service for the gRPC application, and the stockweb.yml file declares the Deployment and Service for an ASP.NET Core 7.0 MVC web application that consumes the gRPC service.\\n\\nTo use a YAML file with kubectl, run the apply -f command:\\n\\n```\\nkubectl apply -f object.yml\\n```\\n\\nThe apply comman\", \"d will check the validity of the YAML file and display any errors received from the API, but doesn't wait until all the objects declared in the file have been created because this step can take some time. Use the kubectl get command with the relevant object types to check on object creation in the cluster.\\n\\n#### **The namespace declaration**\\n\\nNamespace declaration is simple and requires only assigning a name:\\n\\n```\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Namespace\\nmetadata:\\n name: stocks\\n```\\n\\nUse kubectl to apply the namespace.yml file and to confirm the namespace is created successfully:\\n\\n```\\n> kubectl apply -f namespace.yml\\nnamespace/stocks created\\n> kubectl get namespaces\\nNAME STATUS AGE\\nstocks Active 2m53s\\n```\\n\\n#### **The StockData application**\\n\\nThe stockdata.yml file declares two objects: a Deployment and a Service.\\n\\n#### **The StockData Deployment**\\n\\nThe Deployment part of the YAML file provides the spec for the deployment itself, including the number of replicas required, and a template for the Po\", \"d objects to be created and managed by the deployment. Note that Deployment objects are managed by the apps API, as specified in apiVersion, rather than the main Kubernetes API.\\n\\n```\\napiVersion: apps/v1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n name: stockdata\\n namespace: stocks\\nspec:\\n selector:\\n matchLabels:\\n run: stockdata\\n replicas: 1\\n template:\\n metadata:\\n labels:\\n run: stockdata\\n spec:\\n containers:\\n - name: stockdata\\n image: stockdata:1.0.0\\n imagePullPolicy: Never\\n resources:\\n limits:\\n cpu: 100m\\n memory: 100Mi\\n ports:\\n - containerPort: 80\\n```\\n\\nThe spec.selector property is used to match running Pods to the Deployment. The Pod's metadata.labels property must match the matchLabels property or the API call will fail.\\n\\nThe template.spec section declares the container to be run. When you're working with a local Kubernetes cluster, such as the one provided by Docker Desktop, you can specify images that were built locally as long as they have a version tag.\\n\\n#### **Important**\\n\\nBy default, Kubernetes \", \"will always check for and try to pull a new image. If it can't find the image in any of its known repositories, the Pod creation will fail. To work with local images, set the imagePullPolicy to Never.\\n\\nThe ports property specifies which container ports should be published on the Pod. The stockservice image runs the service on the standard HTTP port, so port 80 is published.\\n\\nThe resources section applies resource limits to the container running within the Pod. This is a good practice because it prevents an individual Pod from consuming all the available CPU or memory on a node.\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nASP.NET Core 7.0 has been optimized and tuned to run in resource-limited containers. The dotnet/core/aspnet Docker image sets an environment variable to tell the dotnet runtime that it's in a container.\\n\\n#### **The StockData Service**\\n\\nThe Service part of the YAML file declares the service that provides access to the Pods within the cluster.\\n\\n```\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service\\nmetadata:\\n name: stoc\", \"kdata\\n namespace: stocks\\nspec:\\n ports:\\n - port: 80\\n selector:\\n run: stockdata\\n```\\n\\nThe Service spec uses the selector property to match running Pods, in this case looking for Pods that have a label run: stockdata. The specified port on matching Pods is published by the named service. Other Pods running in the stocks namespace can access HTTP on this service by using http://stockdata as the address. Pods running in other namespaces can use the http://stockdata.stocks host name. You can control cross-namespace service access by using [Network Policies.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)\\n\\n#### **Deploy the StockData application**\\n\\nUse kubectl to apply the stockdata.yml file and confirm that the Deployment and Service were created:\\n\\n```\\n> kubectl apply -f .\\\\stockdata.yml\\ndeployment.apps/stockdata created\\nservice/stockdata created\\n> kubectl get deployment stockdata --namespace stocks\\nNAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE\\nstockdata 1/1 1 1 17s\\n> kubectl\", \" get service stockdata --namespace stocks\\nNAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE\\nstockdata ClusterIP 10.97.132.103 <none> 80/TCP 33s\\n```\\n\\n#### **The StockWeb application**\\n\\nThe stockweb.yml file declares the Deployment and Service for the MVC application.\\n\\n```\\napiVersion: apps/v1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n name: stockweb\\n namespace: stocks\\nspec:\\n selector:\\n matchLabels:\\n run: stockweb\\n replicas: 1\\n template:\\n metadata:\\n labels:\\n run: stockweb\\n spec:\\n containers:\\n - name: stockweb\\n image: stockweb:1.0.0\\n imagePullPolicy: Never\\n resources:\\n limits:\\n cpu: 100m\\n memory: 100Mi\\n ports:\\n - containerPort: 80\\n env:\\n - name: StockData__Address\\n value: \\\"http://stockdata\\\"\\n - name: DOTNET_SYSTEM_NET_HTTP_SOCKETSHTTPHANDLER_HTTP2UNENCRYPTEDSUPPORT\\n value: \\\"true\\\"\\n---\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service\\nmetadata:\\n name: stockweb\\n namespace: stocks\\nspec:\\n type: NodePort\\n ports:\\n - port: 80\\n selector:\\n run: stockweb\\n```\\n\\n#### **Environment variables**\\n\\nThe env section of the Deployment object specifies \", \"environment variables to be set in the container that's running the stockweb:1.0.0 images.\\n\\nThe **StockData\\\\_\\\\_Address** environment variable will map to the StockData:Address configuration setting thanks to the EnvironmentVariables configuration provider. This setting uses double underscores between names to separate sections. The address uses the service name of the stockdata Service, which is running in the same Kubernetes namespace.\\n\\nThe **DOTNET\\\\_SYSTEM\\\\_NET\\\\_HTTP\\\\_SOCKETSHTTPHANDLER\\\\_HTTP2UNENCRYPTEDSUPPORT** environment variable sets an [AppContext](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.appcontext) switch that enables unencrypted HTTP/2 connections for [HttpClient.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) This environment variable does the same thing as setting the switch in code, as shown here:\\n\\n```\\nAppContext.SetSwitch(\\\"System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler.Http2UnencryptedSupport\\\", true);\\n```\\n\\nIf you use an environment variable for the switch, yo\", \"u can easily change the context depending on the context in which the application is running.\\n\\n#### **Service types**\\n\\nThe type: NodePort property is used to make the web application accessible from outside the cluster. This property type causes Kubernetes to publish port 80 on the Service to an arbitrary port on the cluster's external network sockets. You can find the assigned port by using the kubectl get service command.\\n\\nThe stockdata Service shouldn't be accessible from outside the cluster, so it uses the default type, ClusterIP.\\n\\nProduction systems will most likely use an integrated load balancer to expose public applications to external consumers. Services exposed in this way should use the LoadBalancer type.\\n\\nFor more information on Service types, see the [Kubernetes Publishing Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types) documentation.\\n\\n#### **Deploy the StockWeb application**\\n\\nUse kubectl to apply the stockweb.y\", \"ml file and confirm that the Deployment and Service were created:\\n\\n```\\n> kubectl apply -f .\\\\stockweb.yml\\ndeployment.apps/stockweb created\\nservice/stockweb created\\n> kubectl get deployment stockweb --namespace stocks\\nNAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE\\nstockweb 1/1 1 1 8s\\n> kubectl get service stockweb --namespace stocks\\nNAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE\\nstockweb NodePort 10.106.141.5 <none> 80:32564/TCP 13s\\n```\\n\\nThe output of the get service command shows that the HTTP port has been published to port 32564 on the external network. For Docker Desktop, this IP address will be localhost. You can access the application by browsing to http://localhost:32564.\\n\\n#### <span id=\\\"page-98-0\\\"></span>**Test the application**\\n\\nThe StockWeb application displays a list of NASDAQ stocks that are retrieved from a simple requestreply service. For this demonstration, each line also shows the unique ID of the Service instance that returned it.\\n\\n![](_page_98_Figure_2.jpeg)\\n\\nIf the number of replic\", \"as of the stockdata Service were increased, you might expect the **Server** value to change from line to line, but in fact all 100 records are always returned from the same instance. If you refresh the page every few seconds, the server ID remains the same. Why does this happen? There are two factors at play here.\\n\\nFirst, the Kubernetes Service discovery system uses round-robin load balancing by default. The first time the DNS server is queried, it will return the first matching IP address for the Service. The next time, it will return the next IP address in the list, and so on, until the end. At that point, it loops back to the start.\\n\\nSecond, the HttpClient used for the StockWeb application's gRPC client is created and managed by the [ASP.NET Core HttpClientFactory,](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests) and a single instance of this client is used for every call to the\", \" page. The client only does one DNS lookup, so all requests are routed to the same IP address. And because the HttpClientHandler is cached for performance reasons, multiple requests in quick succession will *all* use the same IP address, until the cached DNS entry expires or the handler instance is disposed for some reason.\\n\\nThe result is that by default requests to a gRPC Service aren't balanced across all instances of that Service in the cluster. Different consumers will use different instances, but that doesn't guarantee a good distribution of requests or a balanced use of resources.\\n\\nThe next chapter, [Service meshes,](#page-99-0) will address this problem.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-99-0\\\"></span>Service meshes\\n\\nA service mesh is an infrastructure component that takes control of routing service requests within a network. Service meshes can handle all kinds of network-level concerns within a Kubernetes cluster, including:\\n\\n- Service discovery\\n- Load balancing\\n- Fault tolerance\\n- Encryption\\n-\", \" Monitoring\\n\\nKubernetes service meshes work by adding an extra container, called a *sidecar proxy*, to each pod included in the mesh. The proxy takes over handling all inbound and outbound network requests. You can then keep the configuration and management of networking matters separate from the application containers. In many cases, this separation doesn't require any changes to the application code.\\n\\nIn the [previous chapter's example](#page-98-0), the gRPC requests from the web application were all routed to a single instance of the gRPC service. This happens because the service's host name is resolved to an IP address, and that IP address is cached for the lifetime of the HttpClientHandler instance. It might be possible to work around this behavior by handling DNS lookups manually or creating multiple clients. But this workaround would complicate the application code without adding any business or customer value.\\n\\nWhen you use a service mesh, the requests from the application cont\", \"ainer are sent to the sidecar proxy. The sidecar proxy can then distribute them intelligently across all instances of the other service. The mesh can also:\\n\\n- Respond seamlessly to failures of individual instances of a service.\\n- Handle retry semantics for failed calls or timeouts.\\n- Reroute failed requests to an alternate instance without returning to the client application.\\n\\nThe following screenshot shows the StockWeb application running with the Linkerd service mesh. There are no changes to the application code, and the Docker image isn't being used. The only change required was the addition of an annotation to the deployment in the YAML files for the stockdata and stockweb services.\\n\\n![](_page_100_Figure_0.jpeg)\\n\\nYou can see from the **Server** column that the requests from the StockWeb application have been routed to both replicas of the StockData service, despite originating from a single HttpClient instance in the application code. In fact, if you review the code, you'll see tha\", \"t all 100 requests to the StockData service are made simultaneously by using the same HttpClient instance. With the service mesh, those requests will be balanced across however many service instances are available.\\n\\nService meshes apply only to traffic within a cluster. For external clients, see the next chapter, [Load](#page-103-0)  [Balancing.](#page-103-0)\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-100-0\\\"></span>**Service mesh options**\\n\\nThree general-purpose service mesh implementations are currently available for use with Kubernetes: [Istio,](https://istio.io/) [Linkerd,](https://linkerd.io/) and [Consul Connect.](https://consul.io/mesh.html) All three provide request routing/proxying, traffic encryption, resilience, host-to-host authentication, and traffic control.\\n\\nChoosing a service mesh depends on multiple factors:\\n\\n- The organization's specific requirements around costs, compliance, paid support plans, and so on.\\n- The nature of the cluster, its size, the number of services deployed, and the volume o\", \"f traffic within the cluster network.\\n- Ease of deploying and managing the mesh and using it with services.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-100-1\\\"></span>**Example: Add Linkerd to a deployment**\\n\\nIn this example, you'll learn how to use the Linkerd service mesh with the *StockKube* application from [the previous section](#page-91-0). To follow this example, you'll need to [install the Linkerd CLI.](https://linkerd.io/2/getting-started/#step-1-install-the-cli) You can download\\n\\nWindows binaries from the section that lists GitHub releases. Be sure to use the most recent *stable* release and not one of the edge releases.\\n\\nWith the Linkerd CLI installed, follow the [Getting Started](https://linkerd.io/2/getting-started/index.html) instructions to install the Linkerd components on your Kubernetes cluster. The instructions are straightforward, and the installation should take only a couple of minutes on a local Kubernetes instance.\\n\\n#### **Add Linkerd to Kubernetes deployments**\\n\\nThe Linkerd CLI provides \", \"an inject command to add the necessary sections and properties to Kubernetes files. You can run the command and write the output to a new file.\\n\\n```\\nlinkerd inject stockdata.yml > stockdata-with-mesh.yml\\nlinkerd inject stockweb.yml > stockweb-with-mesh.yml\\n```\\n\\nYou can inspect the new files to see what changes have been made. For deployment objects, a metadata annotation is added to tell Linkerd to inject a sidecar proxy container into the pod when it's created.\\n\\nIt's also possible to pipe the output of the linkerd inject command to kubectl directly. The following commands will work in PowerShell or any Linux shell.\\n\\n```\\nlinkerd inject stockdata.yml | kubectl apply -f -\\nlinkerd inject stockweb.yml | kubectl apply -f -\\n```\\n\\n#### **Inspect services in the Linkerd dashboard**\\n\\nOpen the Linkerd dashboard by using the linkerd CLI.\\n\\nlinkerd dashboard\\n\\nThe dashboard provides detailed information about all services that are connected to the mesh.\\n\\n![](_page_102_Figure_0.jpeg)\\n\\nIf you increase \", \"the number of replicas of the StockData gRPC service as shown in the following example, and refresh the StockWeb page in the browser, you should see a mix of IDs in the **Server** column. This mix indicates that all the available instances are serving requests.\\n\\n```\\napiVersion: apps/v1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n name: stockdata\\n namespace: stocks\\nspec:\\n selector:\\n matchLabels:\\n run: stockdata\\n replicas: 2 # Increase the target number of instances\\n template:\\n metadata:\\n annotations:\\n linkerd.io/inject: enabled\\n creationTimestamp: null\\n labels:\\n run: stockdata\\n spec:\\n containers:\\n - name: stockdata\\n image: stockdata:1.0.0\\n imagePullPolicy: Never\\n resources:\\n limits:\\n cpu: 100m\\n memory: 100Mi\\n ports:\\n - containerPort: 80\\n```\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-103-0\\\"></span>Load balancing gRPC\\n\\nA typical deployment of a gRPC application includes a number of identical instances of the service, providing resilience and horizontal scalability. Load balancing distributes incoming requests across these instanc\", \"es to provide full usage of all available resources. To make this load balancing invisible to the client, it's common to use a proxy load balancer server to handle requests from clients and route them to back-end instances.\\n\\nLoad balancers are classified according to the *layer* they operate on. Layer 4 load balancers work on the *transport* level, for example, with TCP sockets, connections, and packets. Layer 7 load balancers work at the *application* level, specifically handling HTTP/2 requests for gRPC applications.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-103-1\\\"></span>**L4 load balancers**\\n\\nAn L4 load balancer accepts a TCP connection request from a client, opens another connection to one of the back-end instances, and copies data between the two connections with no real processing. L4 offers excellent performance and low latency, but with little control or intelligence. As long as the client keeps the connection open, all requests will be directed to the same back-end instance.\\n\\n[Azure Load Balancer](\", \"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer/) is an example of an L4 load balancer.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-103-2\\\"></span>**L7 load balancers**\\n\\nAn L7 load balancer parses incoming HTTP/2 requests and passes them on to back-end instances on a request-by-request basis, no matter how long the connection is held by the client.\\n\\nExamples of L7 load balancers:\\n\\n- [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/)\\n- [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/)\\n- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/)\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, L7 load balancers are the best choice for gRPC and other HTTP/2 applications (and for HTTP applications generally, in fact). L4 load balancers will *work* with gRPC applications, but they're primarily useful when low latency and low overhead are important.\\n\\n#### **Important**\\n\\nAt the time of this writing, some L7 load balancers don't support all the parts of the HTTP/2 specification that are required by gRPC services, such as trailing headers.\\n\\nIf you're using TLS encryption, load balancers can terminate the\", \" TLS connection and pass unencrypted requests to the back-end application, or they can pass the encrypted request along. Either way, the load balancer will need to be configured with the server's public and private key so it can decrypt requests for processing.\\n\\nSee to the documentation for your preferred load balancer to find out how to configure it to handle HTTP/2 requests with your back-end services.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-104-0\\\"></span>**Load balancing within Kubernetes**\\n\\nSee [the section on service meshes](#page-99-0) for a discussion of load balancing across internal services on Kubernetes.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-104-1\\\"></span>Application Performance Management\\n\\nIn production environments like Kubernetes, it's important to monitor applications to ensure they're running optimally. Logging and metrics are important in particular. ASP.NET Core, including gRPC, provides built-in support for producing and managing log messages and metrics data, as well as *tracing* data.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-10\", \"4-2\\\"></span>**The difference between logging and metrics**\\n\\n*Logging* is concerned with text messages that record detailed information about things that have happened in the system. Log messages might include exception data, like stack traces, or structured data that provide context about the message. Logging output is commonly written to a searchable text store.\\n\\n*Metrics* refers to numeric data designed to be aggregated and presented by using charts and graphs in a dashboard. The dashboard provides a view of the overall health and performance of an application. Metrics data can also be used to trigger automated alerts when a threshold is exceeded. Here are some examples of metrics data:\\n\\n- Time taken to process requests.\\n- The number of requests per second being handled by an instance of a service.\\n- The number of failed requests on an instance.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-104-3\\\"></span>**Logging in ASP.NET Core gRPC**\\n\\nASP.NET Core provides built-in support for logging, in the form of [Micros\", \"oft.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging) NuGet package. The core parts of this library are included with the Web SDK, so there's no need to install it manually. By default, log messages are written to the standard output (the \\\"console\\\") and to any attached debugger. To write logs to persistent external data stores, you might need to import [optional logging sink packages.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/#third-party-logging-providers)\\n\\nThe ASP.NET Core gRPC framework writes detailed diagnostic logging messages to this logging framework, so they can be processed and stored along with your application's own messages.\\n\\n## **Produce log messages**\\n\\nThe logging extension is automatically registered with ASP.NET Core's dependency injection system, so you can specify loggers as a constructor parameter on gRPC service types.\\n\\n```\\npublic class StockData : Stocks.StocksBase\\n{\\n private readonly ILogger<StockData> _logger;\\n p\", \"ublic StockData(ILogger<StockData> logger)\\n```\\n\\n```\\n {\\n _logger = logger;\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nMany log messages, such as requests and exceptions, are provided by the ASP.NET Core and gRPC framework components. Add your own log messages to provide detail and context about application logic, rather than lower-level concerns.\\n\\nFor more information about writing log messages and available logging sinks and targets, see [Logging in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/)\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-105-0\\\"></span>**Metrics in ASP.NET Core gRPC**\\n\\nThe .NET Core runtime provides a set of components for emitting and observing metrics. These include APIs such as the [EventSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource) and [EventCounter](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventcounter) classes. These APIs can emit basic numeric data that can be consumed by external processes, like the [dotnet-count\", \"ers global tool,](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters) or Event Tracing for Windows. For more information about using EventCounter in your own code, see [EventCounter introduction.](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Diagnostics.Tracing/documentation/EventCounterTutorial.md)\\n\\nFor more advanced metrics and for writing metric data to a wider range of data stores, you might try an open-source project called [App Metrics.](https://www.app-metrics.io/) This suite of libraries provides an extensive set of types to instrument your code. It also offers packages to write metrics to different kinds of targets that include time-series databases, such as Prometheus and InfluxDB, and [Application Insights.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) The [App.Metrics.AspNetCore.Mvc](https://www.nuget.org/packages/App.Metrics.AspNetCore.Mvc/) NuGet package even adds a comprehensive set of basic metrics that ar\", \"e automatically generated via integration with the ASP.NET Core framework. The project website provides [templates](https://www.app-metrics.io/samples/grafana/) for displaying those metrics with the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) visualization platform.\\n\\n#### **Produce metrics**\\n\\nMost metrics platforms support the following types:\\n\\n| Metric type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Counter     | Tracks how often something happens, such as<br>requests and\", \" errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\\n| Gauge       | Records a single value that changes over time,<br>such as active connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\\n| Histogram   | Measures a distribution of values across<br>arbitrary limits. For example, a histogram can<br>track dataset size, counting how many<br>contained <10 records, how many contained<br>11-100 records, how many contained 101-1000<br>records, and how many contained >1000<br>records. |\\n| Meter       | Measures the rate at which an event occurs in<br>various time spans.                                                                                                          \", \"                                                                                                       |\\n\\n| Metric type | Description                                                                              |\\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Timer       | Tracks the duration of events and the rate at<br>which it occurs, stored as a histogram. |\\n\\nBy using *App Metrics*, an IMetrics interface can be obtained via dependency injection, and used to record any of these metrics for a gRPC service. The following example shows how to count the number of Get requests made over time:\\n\\n```\\npublic class StockData : Stocks.StocksBase\\n{\\n private static readonly CounterOptions GetRequestCounter = new CounterOptions\\n {\\n Name = \\\"StockData_Get_Requests\\\",\\n MeasurementUnit = Unit.Calls\\n };\\n private readonly IStockRepository _repository;\\n private readonly IMetrics _metrics;\\n public StockData(IStockRepository repository, IMetrics\", \" metrics)\\n {\\n _repository = repository;\\n _metrics = metrics;\\n }\\n public override async Task<GetResponse> Get(GetRequest request, ServerCallContext \\ncontext)\\n {\\n _metrics.Measure.Counter.Increment(GetRequestCounter);\\n // Serve request...\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Store and visualize metrics data**\\n\\nThe best way to store metrics data is in a *time-series database*, a specialized data store designed to record numerical data series marked with timestamps. The most popular of these databases are [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [InfluxDB.](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/) Microsoft Azure also provides dedicated metrics storage through the [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview)  [Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview) service.\\n\\nThe current go-to solution for visualizing metrics data is [Grafana,](https://grafana.com/) which works with a wide range of storage providers. The following image shows an example Grafana dash\", \"board that displays metrics from the Linkerd service mesh running the StockData sample:\\n\\n![](_page_107_Figure_0.jpeg)\\n\\n#### **Metrics-based alerting**\\n\\nThe numerical nature of metrics data means that it's ideally suited to drive alerting systems, notifying developers or support engineers when a value falls outside of some defined tolerance. The platforms already mentioned all provide support for alerting via a range of options, including emails, text messages, or in-dashboard visualizations.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-107-0\\\"></span>**Distributed tracing**\\n\\nDistributed tracing is a relatively recent development in monitoring, which has arisen from the increasing use of microservices and distributed architectures. A single request from a client browser, application, or device can be broken down into many steps and sub-requests, and involve the use of many services across a network. This activity makes it difficult to correlate log messages and metrics with the specific request that triggered them\", \". Distributed tracing applies identifiers to requests, and allows logs and metrics to be correlated with a particular operation. This tracing is similar to [WCF's](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/end-to-end-tracing)  [end-to-end tracing](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/end-to-end-tracing), but it's applied across multiple platforms.\\n\\nDistributed tracing has grown quickly in popularity and is beginning to standardize. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation created the [Open Tracing standard,](https://opentracing.io/) attempting to provide vendor-neutral libraries for working with back ends like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) and [Elastic APM.](https://www.elastic.co/products/apm) At the same time, Google created the [OpenCensus project](https://opencensus.io/) to address the same set of problems. These two projects are merging into a new project, [OpenTelemetry,](https://opentelemetry.io/) which aims to be t\", \"he industry standard of the future.\\n\\n### **How distributed tracing works**\\n\\nDistributed tracing is based on the concept of *spans*: named, timed operations that are part of a single *trace*, which can involve processing on multiple nodes of a system. When a new operation is initiated, a trace is created with a unique identifier. For each sub-operation, a span is created with its own\\n\\nidentifier and trace identifier. As the request passes around the system, various components can create *child* spans that include the identifier of their *parent*. A span has a *context*, which contains the trace and span identifiers, as well as useful data in the form of key and value pairs (called *baggage*).\\n\\n#### **Distributed tracing with DiagnosticSource**\\n\\n.NET has an internal module that maps well to distributed traces and spans: [DiagnosticSource.](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/DiagnosticSourceUsersGuide.md#diagnosticsource-users\", \"-guide) As well as providing a simple way to produce and consume diagnostics within a process, the DiagnosticSource module has the concept of an *activity*. An activity is effectively an implementation of a distributed trace, or a span within a trace. The internals of the module take care of parent/child activities, including allocating identifiers. For more information about using the Activity type, see the [Activity User Guide on GitHub.](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/ActivityUserGuide.md#activity-user-guide)\\n\\nBecause DiagnosticSource is a part of the core framework and later, it's supported by several core components. These include [HttpClient,](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) Entity Framework Core, and ASP.NET Core, including explicit support in the gRPC framework. When ASP.NET Core receives a request, it checks for a pair of HTTP headers matching the [W3C Trace Context](https://ww\", \"w.w3.org/TR/trace-context) standard. If the headers are found, an activity is started by using the identity values and context from the headers. If no headers are found, an activity is started with generated identity values that match the standard format. Any diagnostics generated by the framework or by application code during the lifetime of this activity can be tagged with the trace and span identifiers. The HttpClient support extends this functionality further by checking for a current activity on every request, and automatically adding the trace headers to the outgoing request.\\n\\nThe ASP.NET Core gRPC client and server libraries include explicit support for DiagnosticSource and Activity, and create activities and apply and use header information automatically.\\n\\n#### **Note**\\n\\nAll of this happens only if a listener is consuming the diagnostic information. If there's no listener, no diagnostics are written and no activities are created.\\n\\n# **Add your own DiagnosticSource and Activity*\", \"*\\n\\nTo add your own diagnostics or create explicit spans within your application code, see the [DiagnosticSource User Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/DiagnosticSourceUsersGuide.md#instrumenting-with-diagnosticsourcediagnosticlistener) and [Activity User Guide.](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/ActivityUserGuide.md#activity-usage)\\n\\n#### **Store distributed trace data**\\n\\nAt the time of writing, the OpenTelemetry project is still in the early stages, and only alpha-quality packages are available for .NET applications. The OpenTracing project currently offers more mature libraries.\\n\\nThe OpenTracing API is described in the following section. If you want to use the OpenTelemetry API in your application instead, refer to the [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet) on GitHub.\\n\\n#### **Use the OpenTracing pack\", \"age to store distributed trace data**\\n\\nThe [OpenTracing NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTracing/) supports all OpenTracing-compliant back ends (which can be used independently of DiagnosticSource). There's an additional package from the OpenTracing API\\n\\nContributions project, [OpenTracing.Contrib.NetCore.](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTracing.Contrib.NetCore/) This package adds a DiagnosticSource listener, and writes events and activities to a back end automatically. Enabling this package is as simple as installing it from NuGet and adding it as a service in your Program class.\\n\\n```\\n//\\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenTracing();\\n//\\n```\\n\\nThe OpenTracing package is an abstraction layer, and as such it requires implementation specific to the back end. OpenTracing API implementations are available for the following open source back ends.\\n\\n| Name        | Package                | Website                 |\\n|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\\n| Ja\", \"eger      | Jaeger                 | jaegertracing.io        |\\n| Elastic APM | Elastic.Apm.NetCoreAll | elastic.co/products/apm |\\n\\nFor more information on the OpenTracing API for .NET, see the [OpenTracing for C#](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-csharp) and the [OpenTracing Contrib C#/.NET Core](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/csharp-netcore) repositories on GitHub.\\n\\n# <span id=\\\"page-110-0\\\"></span>Appendix A - Transactions\\n\\nWindows Communication Foundation (WCF) supports distributed transactions, allowing you to perform atomic operations across multiple services. This functionality is based on the [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms684146(v=vs.85))  [Distributed Transaction Coordinator.](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms684146(v=vs.85))\\n\\nIn the newer microservices landscape, this type of automated distributed transaction processing isn't possible. There are too many different technologies involved, \", \"including relational databases, NoSQL data stores, and messaging systems. There might also be a mix of operating systems, programming languages, and frameworks in use in a single environment.\\n\\nWCF distributed transaction is an implementation of what is known as a [two-phase commit \\\\(2PC\\\\).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol) You can implement 2PC transactions manually by coordinating messages across services, creating open transactions within each service, and sending commit or rollback messages, depending upon success or failure. However, the complexity involved in managing 2PC can increase exponentially as systems evolve. Open transactions hold database locks that can negatively affect performance, or, worse, cause cross-service deadlocks.\\n\\nIf possible, it's best to avoid distributed transactions altogether. If two items of data are so linked as to require atomic updates, consider handling them both with the same service. Apply those atomic changes by using a si\", \"ngle request or message to that service.\\n\\nIf that isn't possible, then one alternative is to use the [Saga pattern.](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html) In a saga, updates are processed sequentially; as each update succeeds, the next one is triggered. These triggers can be propagated from service to service, or managed by a saga coordinator or orchestrator. If an update fails at any point during the process, the services that have already completed their updates apply specific logic to reverse them.\\n\\nAnother option is to use Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Command/Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), as described in the [.NET Microservices e-book.](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/) In particular, using domain events or [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) can help to ensure that updates are consistently, if not immediately, applied.\"]"
