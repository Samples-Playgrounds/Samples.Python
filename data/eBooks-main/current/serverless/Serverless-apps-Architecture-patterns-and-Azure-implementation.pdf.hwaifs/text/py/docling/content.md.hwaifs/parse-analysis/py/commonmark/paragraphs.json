    "Microservices. The microservices architecture is becoming the preferred approach for distributed and large or complex mission-critical applications that are based on multiple independent subsystems in the form of autonomous services. In a microservice-based architecture, the application is built as a collection of services that can be developed, tested, versioned, deployed, and scaled independently. Serverless is an architecture well-suited for building these services.",
