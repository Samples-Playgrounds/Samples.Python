A\ncontainer is essentially a runtime that contains the bare essentials needed to run a unique application.\nThe kernel or core part of the host operating system and services such as storage are shared across a\nhost. The shared kernel enables containers to be lightweight (some are mere megabytes in size,\ncompared to the gigabyte size of typical virtual machines). With hosts already running, containers can\nbe started quickly, facilitating high availability. The ability to spin up containers quickly also provides\nextra layers of resiliency. Docker is one of the more popular implementations of containers.\n\nBenefits of containers include:\n\n['Lightweight and portable', 'Self-contained so no need to install dependencies', 'Provide a consistent environment regardless of the host (runs exactly same on a laptop as on a\\ncloud server)', 'Can be provisioned quickly for scale-out', 'Can be restarted quickly to recover from failure']\n\nA container runs on a container host (that in turn may run on a bare metal machine or a virtual\nmachine).

After that function exits, all its needed\nresources may be freed. The trigger might be manual, a timed process, an HTTP request, or a file\nupload. The result of the trigger is the execution of code. Although serverless platforms vary, most\nprovide access to pre-defined APIs and bindings to streamline tasks such as writing to a database or\nqueueing results.\n\nServerless is an architecture that relies heavily on abstracting away the host environment to focus on\ncode. It can be thought of as _less server_ .\n\nContainer solutions provide developers existing build scripts to publish code to serverless-ready\nimages. Other implementations use existing PaaS solutions to provide a scalable architecture.\n\nThe abstraction means the DevOps team doesn\u2019t have to provision or manage servers, nor specific\ncontainers. The serverless platform hosts code, either as script or packaged executables built with a\nrelated SDK, and allocates the necessary resources for the code to scale.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates four serverless components. An HTTP request causes the Checkout\nAPI code to run. The Checkout API inserts code into a database, and the insert triggers several other\nfunctions to run to perform tasks like computing tasks and fulfilling the order.\n\n9 CHAPTER 1 | Architecture approaches\n\nThe advantages of serverless include:\n\n['**High density.** Many instances of the same serverless code can run on the same host compared\\nto containers or virtual machines.

In both scenarios, serverless can accommodate the\nmiddleware or REST API request by providing the necessary business logic. A common architecture is\nto stand up a lightweight static web server. The Single Page Application (SPA) serves HTML, CSS,\nJavaScript, and other browser assets. The web app then connects to a microservices back end.", "Mobile back ends": "The event-driven paradigm of serverless apps makes them ideal as mobile back ends. The mobile\ndevice triggers the events and the serverless code executes to satisfy requests. Taking advantage of a\nserverless model enables developers to enhance business logic without having to deploy a full\napplication update. The serverless approach also enables teams to share endpoints and work in\nparallel.\n\nMobile developers can build business logic without becoming experts on the server side.

Developers worked with operations to provision servers\n\n14 CHAPTER 2 | Serverless architecture\n\nand configure them appropriately. Sometimes days or even weeks were spent on building a\ndeployment pipeline. All of these challenges are addressed by serverless.\n\nServerless abstracts the server-side dependencies and enables the developer to focus on business\nlogic. For example, a mobile developer who builds apps using a JavaScript framework can build\nserverless functions with JavaScript as well. The serverless host manages the operating system, a\nNode.js instance to host the code, package dependencies, and more. The developer is provided a\nsimple set of inputs and a standard template for outputs. They then can focus on building and testing\nthe business logic. They\u2019re therefore able to use existing skills to build the back-end logic for the\nmobile app without having to learn new platforms or become a \u201cserver-side developer.\u201d\n\nMost cloud providers offer mobile-based serverless products that simplify the entire mobile\ndevelopment lifecycle.

Avoiding state enables\nserverless to be ephemeral, to scale out, and to provide resiliency without a central point of failure. In\nsome circumstances, business processes require state. If your process requires state, you have two\noptions. You can adopt a model other than serverless, or interact with a separate service that provides\nstate. Adding state can complicate the solution and make it harder to scale, and potentially create a\nsingle point of failure. Carefully consider whether your function absolutely requires state.

One solution may be to break your process into smaller\ncomponents that individually take less time to run. If your process runs long because of dependencies,\nyou can also consider an asynchronous workflow using a solution like durable functions.

Fault tolerance\nrefers to the ability of your application to continue running even after unexpected exceptions or\ninvalid states are encountered. Fault tolerance is typically a function of the code itself and how it\u2019s\nwritten to handle exceptions. Resiliency refers to how capable the app is at recovering from failures.\nResiliency is often managed by the serverless platform.

A common approach is to use \u201cgreen/blue deployments.\u201d The green deployment is the\ncurrent function. A new \u201cblue\u201d version is deployed to production and tested. When testing passes, the\ngreen and blue versions are swapped so the new version comes live. If any issues are encountered,\nthey can be swapped back.

It addresses several common\nproblems. In traditional Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) based systems, conflicts can arise from\nhigh volume of both reads and writes to the same data store. Locking may frequently occur and\ndramatically slow down reads. Often, data is presented as a composite of several domain objects and\nread operations must combine data from different entities.\n\nUsing CQRS, a read might involve a special \u201cflattened\u201d entity that models data the way it\u2019s consumed.\nThe read is handled differently than how it\u2019s stored. For example, although the database may store a\ncontact as a header record with a child address record, the read could involve an entity with both\n\n19 CHAPTER 2 | Serverless architecture\n\nheader and address properties. There are myriad approaches to creating the read model. It might be\nmaterialized from views. Update operations could be encapsulated as isolated events that then trigger\nupdates to two different models. Separate models exist for reading and writing.\n\nServerless can accommodate the CQRS pattern by providing the segregated endpoints. One serverless\nfunction accommodates queries or reads, and a different serverless function or set of functions\nhandles update operations. A serverless function may also be responsible for keeping the read model\n[up-to-date, and can be triggered by the database\u2019s change feed. Front-end development is simplified](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed)\nto connecting to the necessary endpoints. Processing of events is handled on the back end.

These events can trigger serverless functions to execute a piece of business logic. An\nexample of event-based processing is event-sourced systems. An \u201cevent\u201d is raised to mark a task as\ncomplete. A serverless function triggered by the event updates the appropriate database document. A\n[second serverless function may use the event to update the read model for the system. Azure Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview)\n[Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview) provides a way to integrate events with functions as subscribers.\n\n[Events are informational messages.

An example of asynchronous processing is an OCR app. An image is submitted and\nqueued for processing. Scanning the image to extract text may take time, and once it\u2019s finished a\nnotification is sent. Serverless can handle both the invocation and the result in this scenario.", "**Web apps and APIs**": "A popular scenario for serverless is N-tier applications, most commonly ones where the UI layer is a\nweb app. The popularity of Single Page Applications (SPA) has surged recently. SPA apps render a\nsingle page, then rely on API calls and the returned data to dynamically render new UI without\nreloading a full page. Client-side rendering provides a much faster, more responsive application to the\nend user.\n\nServerless endpoints triggered by HTTP calls can be used to handle the API requests. For example, an\nad services company may call a serverless function with user profile information to request custom\nadvertising. The serverless function returns the custom ad and the web page renders it.\n\n21 CHAPTER 2 | Serverless architecture", "**Data pipeline**": "Serverless functions can be used to facilitate a data pipeline.

Serverless makes it possible to\nindependently scale, test, and deploy individual components of your application. Serverless is uniquely\nsuited to implement microservices architectures and integrates fully into a DevOps pipeline.\n\n**Code as a unit of deployment.** Serverless abstracts the hardware, OS, and runtime away from the\napplication. Serverless enables focusing on business logic in code as the unit of deployment.\n\n**Triggers and bindings.** Serverless eases integration with storage, APIs, and other cloud resources.\nAzure Functions provides triggers to execute code and bindings to interact with resources.\n\n**Microservices.** The microservices architecture is becoming the preferred approach for distributed and\nlarge or complex mission-critical applications that are based on multiple independent subsystems in\nthe form of autonomous services. In a microservice-based architecture, the application is built as a\ncollection of services that can be developed, tested, versioned, deployed, and scaled independently.\nServerless is an architecture well-suited for building these services.\n\n**Serverless platforms.** Serverless isn\u2019t just about the code. Platforms that support serverless\narchitectures include serverless workflows and orchestration, serverless messaging and event services,\nand serverless databases.\n\n**Serverless challenges.** Serverless introduces challenges related to distributed application\ndevelopment, such as fragmented and independent data models, resiliency, versioning, and service\ndiscovery. Serverless may not be ideally suited to long running processes or components that benefit\nfrom tighter coupling.\n\n**Serverless as a tool, not the toolbox.** Serverless is not the exclusive solution to application\narchitecture. It is a tool that can be leveraged as part of a hybrid application that may contain\ntraditional tiers, monolith back ends, and containers. Serverless can be used to enhance existing\nsolutions and is not an all-or-nothing approach to application development.\n\n46 CHAPTER 6 | Conclusion"}}
