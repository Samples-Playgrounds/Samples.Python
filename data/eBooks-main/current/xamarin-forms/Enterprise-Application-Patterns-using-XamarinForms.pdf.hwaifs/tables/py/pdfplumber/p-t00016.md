|  0 | Tip: Centralize data conversions in a conversion layer                                              |
|  1 | It's also possible to use converters as a separate data conversion layer that sits between the view |
|  2 | model and the view. This can be necessary, for example, when data requires special formatting that  |
|  3 | the view model doesn't provide.                                                                     |
