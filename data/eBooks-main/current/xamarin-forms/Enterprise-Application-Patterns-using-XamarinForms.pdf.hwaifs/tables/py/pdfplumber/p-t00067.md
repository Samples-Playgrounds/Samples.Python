|  0 | Note: OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 are very similar, while having different responsibilities.     |
|  1 | OpenID Connect is an authentication layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. OAuth 2 is a protocol |
|  2 | that allows applications to request access tokens from a security token service and use them to   |
|  3 | communicate with APIs. This delegation reduces complexity in both client applications and APIs    |
|  4 | since authentication and authorization can be centralized.                                        |
|  5 | The combination of OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 combine the two fundamental security              |
|  6 | concerns of authentication and API access, and IdentityServer 4 is an implementation of these     |
|  7 | protocols.                                                                                        |
