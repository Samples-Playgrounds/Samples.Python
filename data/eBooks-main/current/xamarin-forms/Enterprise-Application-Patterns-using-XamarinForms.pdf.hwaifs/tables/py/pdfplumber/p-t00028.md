|  0 | Tip: Consider an IContainer as being immutable                                                    |
|  1 | While Autofac provides an Update method to update registrations in an existing container, calling |
|  2 | this method should be avoided where possible. There are risks to modifying a container after it's |
|  3 | been built, particularly if the container has been used. For more information, see Consider a     |
|  4 | Container as Immutable on readthedocs.io.                                                         |
