|  0 | Tip: Consider using API gateway communication                                                     |
|  1 | Direct client-to-microservice communication can have drawbacks when building a large and          |
|  2 | complex microservice based application, but it's more than adequate for a small application. When |
|  3 | designing a large microservice based application with tens of microservices, consider using API   |
|  4 | gateway communication. For more information, see .NET Microservices: Architecture for             |
|  5 | Containerized .NET Applications.                                                                  |
