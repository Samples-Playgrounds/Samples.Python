|  0 | Tip: Avoid enabling and disabling UI elements in the code-behind                                     |
|  1 | Ensure that view models are responsible for defining logical state changes that affect some aspects  |
|  2 | of the view's display, such as whether a command is available, or an indication that an operation is |
|  3 | pending. Therefore, enable and disable UI elements by binding to view model properties, rather       |
|  4 | than enabling and disabling them in code-behind.                                                     |
