{"1": {"An introduction to Blazor for ASP.NET Web Forms developers": {"An open-source and cross-platform .NET": "When .NET and ASP.NET Web Forms first shipped, the platform ecosystem looked much different than\nit does today. The desktop and server markets were dominated by Windows. Alternative platforms like\nmacOS and Linux were still struggling to gain traction. ASP.NET Web Forms ships with the .NET\nFramework as a Windows-only component, which means ASP.NET Web Forms apps can only run on\nWindows Server machines. Many modern environments now use different kinds of platforms for\nservers and development machines such that cross-platform support for many users is an absolute\nrequirement.\n\nMost modern web frameworks are now also open-source, which has a number of benefits. Users\naren\u2019t beheld to a single project owner to fix bugs and add features. Open-source projects provide\nimproved transparency on development progress and upcoming changes. Open-source projects enjoy\ncontributions from an entire community, and they foster a supportive open-source ecosystem.\nDespite the risks of open-source, many consumers and contributors have found suitable mitigations\nthat enable them to enjoy the benefits of an open-source ecosystem in a safe and reasonable way.\nExamples of such mitigations include contributor license agreements, friendly licenses, pedigree scans,\nand supporting foundations.\n\nThe .NET community has embraced both cross-platform support and open-source. .NET Core is an\nopen-source and cross-platform implementation of .NET that runs on a plethora of platforms,\nincluding Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions. Xamarin provides Mono, an open-source\nversion of .NET. Mono runs on Android, iOS, and a variety of other form factors, including watches\n[and smart TVs. In 2020, Microsoft released .NET 5 that reconciled .NET Core and Mono into \u201ca single](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0/)\n.NET runtime and framework that can be used everywhere and that has uniform runtime behaviors\nand developer experiences.\u201d\n\nWill ASP.NET Web Forms benefit from the move to open-source and cross-platform support? The\nanswer, unfortunately, is no, or at least not to the same extent as the rest of the platform. The .NET\n[team made it clear](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) that ASP.NET Web Forms won\u2019t be ported to .NET Core or .NET 8. Why is that?\n\nThere were efforts in the early days of .NET Core to port ASP.NET Web Forms. The number of breaking\nchanges required were found to be too drastic. There\u2019s also an admission here that even for Microsoft,\nthere\u2019s a limit to the number of web frameworks that it can support simultaneously. Perhaps someone\nin the community will take up the cause of creating an open-source and cross-platform version of\n[ASP.NET Web Forms. The source code for ASP.NET Web Forms](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) has been made available publicly in\nreference form. But for the time being, it seems ASP.NET Web Forms will remain Windows-only and\nwithout an open-source contribution model. If cross-platform support or open-source become\nimportant for your scenarios, then you\u2019ll need to look for something new.\n\nDoes this mean ASP.NET Web Forms is _dead_ and should no longer be used? Of course not! As long as\nthe .NET Framework ships as part of Windows, ASP.NET Web Forms will be a supported framework.\nFor many Web Forms developers, the lack of cross-platform and open-source support is a non-issue.\nIf you don\u2019t have a requirement for cross-platform support, open-source, or any of the other new\nfeatures in .NET Core or .NET 8, then sticking with ASP.NET Web Forms on Windows is fine. ASP.NET\nWeb Forms will continue to be a productive way to write web apps for many years to come.\n\nBut there\u2019s another trend worth considering, and that\u2019s the shift to the client.\n\n2 CHAPTER 1 | An introduction to Blazor for ASP.NET Web Forms developers", "Client-side web development": "All of the .NET-based web frameworks, including ASP.NET Web Forms, have historically had one thing\nin common: they\u2019re _server-rendered_ . In server-rendered web apps, the browser makes a request to the\nserver, which executes some code (.NET code in ASP.NET apps) to produce a response. That response\nis sent back to the browser to handle. In this model, the browser is used as a thin rendering engine.\nThe hard work of producing the UI, running the business logic, and managing state occurs on the\nserver.\n\nHowever, browsers have become versatile platforms. They implement an ever-increasing number of\nopen web standards that grant access to the capabilities of the user\u2019s machine. Why not take\nadvantage of the compute power, storage, memory, and other resources of the client device? UI\ninteractions in particular can benefit from a richer and more interactive feel when handled at least\npartially or completely client-side. Logic and data that should be handled on the server can still be\nhandled server-side. Web API calls or even real-time protocols, like WebSockets, can be used. These\nbenefits are available to web developers for free if they\u2019re willing to write JavaScript. Client-side UI\nframeworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue, simplify client-side web development and have grown in\npopularity. ASP.NET Web Forms developers can also benefit from leveraging the client, and even have\nsome out-of-the-box support with integrated JavaScript frameworks like ASP.NET AJAX.\n\nBut bridging two different platforms and ecosystems (.NET and JavaScript) comes with a cost.\nExpertise is required in two parallel worlds with different languages, frameworks, and tools. Code and\nlogic can\u2019t be easily shared between client and server, resulting in duplication and engineering\noverhead. It can also be difficult to keep up with the JavaScript ecosystem, which has a history of\nevolving at breakneck speed. Front-end framework and build tool preferences change quickly. The\nindustry has observed the progression from Grunt to Gulp to Webpack, and so on. The same restless\nchurn has occurred with front-end frameworks such as jQuery, Knockout, Angular, React, and Vue. But\ngiven JavaScript\u2019s browser monopoly, there was little choice in the matter. That is, until the web\ncommunity got together and caused a _miracle_ to happen!", "WebAssembly fulfills a need": "In 2015, the major browser vendors joined forces in a W3C Community Group to create a new open\nweb standard called WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a byte code for the Web. If you can compile your\ncode to WebAssembly, it can then run on any browser on any platform at near native speed. Initial\nefforts focused on C/C++. The result was a dramatic demonstration of running native 3D graphics\nengines directly in the browser without plugins. WebAssembly has since been standardized and\nimplemented by all major browsers.\n\nWork on running .NET on WebAssembly was announced in late 2017 and released in 2020, including\nsupport in .NET 5 and beyond. The ability to run .NET code directly in the browser enables full-stack\nweb development with .NET.\n\n3 CHAPTER 1 | An introduction to Blazor for ASP.NET Web Forms developers", "Blazor: full-stack web development with .NET": "On its own, the ability to run .NET code in a browser doesn\u2019t provide an end-to-end experience for\ncreating client-side web apps. That\u2019s where Blazor comes in. Blazor is a client-side web UI framework\nbased on C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor can run directly in the browser via WebAssembly. No\nbrowser plugins are required. Alternatively, Blazor apps can run server-side on .NET and handle all\nuser interactions over a real-time connection with the browser.\n\nBlazor has great tooling support in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. The framework also includes\na full UI component model and has built-in facilities for:\n\n['Forms and validation', 'Dependency injection', 'Client-side routing', 'Layouts', 'In-browser debugging', 'JavaScript interop']\n\nBlazor has a lot in common with ASP.NET Web Forms. Both frameworks offer component-based,\nevent-driven, stateful UI programming models. The main architectural difference is that ASP.NET Web\nForms runs only on the server. Blazor can run on the client in the browser. But if you\u2019re coming from\nan ASP.NET Web Forms background, there\u2019s a lot in Blazor that will feel familiar. Blazor is a natural\nsolution for ASP.NET Web Forms developers looking for a way to take advantage of client-side\ndevelopment and the open-source, cross-platform future of .NET.\n\nThis book provides an introduction to Blazor that is catered specifically to ASP.NET Web Forms\ndevelopers. Each Blazor concept is presented in the context of analogous ASP.NET Web Forms\nfeatures and practices. By the end of this book, you\u2019ll have an understanding of:\n\n['How to build Blazor apps.', 'How Blazor works.', 'How Blazor relates to .NET.', 'Reasonable strategies for migrating existing ASP.NET Web Forms apps to Blazor where\\nappropriate.']", "Get started with Blazor": "[Getting started with Blazor is easy.

You\u2019ll also find instructions for setting up the\nBlazor tooling in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.\n\n4 CHAPTER 1 | An introduction to Blazor for ASP.NET Web Forms developers\n\n**CHAPTER**"}}, "2": {"Architecture comparison of ASP.NET Web Forms and Blazor": {"ASP.NET Web Forms": "The ASP.NET Web Forms framework is based on a page-centric architecture. Each HTTP request for a\nlocation in the app is a separate page with which ASP.NET responds. As pages are requested, the\ncontents of the browser are replaced with the results of the page requested.\n\nPages consist of the following components:\n\n['HTML markup', 'C# or Visual Basic code', 'A code-behind class containing logic and event-handling capabilities', 'Controls']\n\nControls are reusable units of web UI that can be programmatically placed and interacted with on a\npage. Pages are composed of files that end with _.aspx_ containing markup, controls, and some code.\nThe code-behind classes are in files with the same base name and an _.aspx.cs_ or _.aspx.vb_ extension,\ndepending on the programming language used. Interestingly, the web server interprets contents of\nthe _.aspx_ files and compiles them whenever they change. This recompilation occurs even if the web\nserver is already running.\n\nControls can be built with markup and delivered as user controls. A user control derives from the\nUserControl class and has a similar structure to the Page. Markup for user controls is stored in an _.ascx_\nfile. An accompanying code-behind class resides in an _.ascx.cs_ or _.ascx.vb_ file. Controls can also be\nbuilt completely with code, by inheriting from either the WebControl or CompositeControl base class.\n\nPages also have an extensive event lifecycle. Each page raises events for the initialization, load,\nprerender, and unload events that occur as the ASP.NET runtime executes the page\u2019s code for each\nrequest.\n\n5 CHAPTER 2 | Architecture comparison of ASP.NET Web Forms and Blazor\n\nControls on a Page typically post-back to the same page that presented the control, and carry along\nwith them a payload from a hidden form field called ViewState. The ViewState field contains\ninformation about the state of the controls at the time they were rendered and presented on the\npage, allowing the ASP.NET runtime to compare and identify changes in the content submitted to the\nserver.", "Blazor": "Blazor is a client-side web UI framework similar in nature to JavaScript front-end frameworks like\nAngular or React. Blazor handles user interactions and renders the necessary UI updates. Blazor _isn\u2019t_\nbased on a request-reply model. User interactions are handled as events that aren\u2019t in the context of\nany particular HTTP request.\n\nBlazor apps consist of one or more root components that are rendered on an HTML page.\n\nHow the user specifies where components should render and how the components are then wired up\nfor user interactions is hosting model specific.\n\nBlazor components are .NET classes that represent a reusable piece of UI. Each component maintains\nits own state and specifies its own rendering logic, which can include rendering other components.\nComponents specify event handlers for specific user interactions to update the component\u2019s state.\n\nAfter a component handles an event, Blazor renders the component and keeps track of what changed\nin the rendered output. Components don\u2019t render directly to the Document Object Model (DOM).\nThey instead render to an in-memory representation of the DOM called a RenderTree so that Blazor\ncan track the changes. Blazor compares the newly rendered output with the previous output to\ncalculate a UI diff that it then applies efficiently to the DOM.\n\n6 CHAPTER 2 | Architecture comparison of ASP.NET Web Forms and Blazor\n\nComponents can also manually indicate that they should be rendered if their state changes outside of\na normal UI event. Blazor uses a SynchronizationContext to enforce a single logical thread of\nexecution. A component\u2019s lifecycle methods and any event callbacks that are raised by Blazor are\nexecuted on this SynchronizationContext.\n\n7 CHAPTER 2 | Architecture comparison of ASP.NET Web Forms and Blazor\n\n**CHAPTER**"}}, "3": {"Blazor app hosting models": {"Blazor WebAssembly apps": "Blazor WebAssembly apps execute directly in the browser on a WebAssembly-based .NET runtime.\nBlazor WebAssembly apps function in a similar way to front-end JavaScript frameworks like Angular or\nReact. However, instead of writing JavaScript you write C#. The .NET runtime is downloaded with the\napp along with the app assembly and any required dependencies. No browser plugins or extensions\nare required.\n\nThe downloaded assemblies are normal .NET assemblies, like you would use in any other .NET app.\nBecause the runtime supports .NET Standard, you can use existing .NET Standard libraries with your\nBlazor WebAssembly app. However, these assemblies will still execute in the browser security\n[sandbox. Some functionality may throw a PlatformNotSupportedException, like trying to access the](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.platformnotsupportedexception)\nfile system or opening arbitrary network connections.\n\nWhen the app loads, the .NET runtime is started and pointed at the app assembly. The app startup\nlogic runs, and the root components are rendered. Blazor calculates the UI updates based on the\nrendered output from the components. The DOM updates are then applied.\n\n8 CHAPTER 3 | Blazor app hosting models\n\nBlazor WebAssembly apps run purely client-side. Such apps can be deployed to static site hosting\nsolutions like GitHub Pages or Azure Static Website Hosting. .NET isn\u2019t required on the server at all.\nDeep linking to parts of the app typically requires a routing solution on the server. The routing\nsolution redirects requests to the root of the app. For example, this redirection can be handled using\nURL rewrite rules in IIS.\n\nTo get all the benefits of Blazor and full-stack .NET web development, host your Blazor WebAssembly\napp with ASP.NET Core. By using .NET on both the client and server, you can easily share code and\nbuild your app using one consistent set of languages, frameworks, and tools. Blazor provides\nconvenient templates for setting up a solution that contains both a Blazor WebAssembly app and an\nASP.NET Core host project. When the solution is built, the built static files from the Blazor app are\nhosted by the ASP.NET Core app with fallback routing already setup.", "Blazor Server apps": "Recall from the Blazor architecture discussion that Blazor components render their output to an\nintermediate abstraction called a RenderTree. The Blazor framework then compares what was\nrendered with what was previously rendered. The differences are applied to the DOM. Blazor\ncomponents are decoupled from how their rendered output is applied. Consequently, the\ncomponents themselves don\u2019t have to run in the same process as the process updating the UI. In fact,\nthey don\u2019t even have to run on the same machine.\n\nIn Blazor Server apps, the components run on the server instead of client-side in the browser. UI\nevents that occur in the browser are sent to the server over a real-time connection. The events are\ndispatched to the correct component instances. The components render, and the calculated UI diff is\nserialized and sent to the browser where it\u2019s applied to the DOM.\n\n9 CHAPTER 3 | Blazor app hosting models\n\nThe Blazor Server hosting model may sound familiar if you\u2019ve used ASP.NET AJAX and the\n[UpdatePanel](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.web.ui.updatepanel) control. The UpdatePanel control handles applying partial page updates in response to\ntrigger events on the page. When triggered, the UpdatePanel requests a partial update and then\napplies it without needing to refresh the page. The state of the UI is managed using ViewState. Blazor\nServer apps are slightly different in that the app requires an active connection with the client.\nAdditionally, all UI state is maintained on the server. Aside from those differences, the two models are\nconceptually similar.", "How to choose the right Blazor hosting model": "[As described in the Blazor hosting model docs, the different Blazor hosting models have different](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models)\ntradeoffs.\n\nThe Blazor WebAssembly hosting model has the following benefits:\n\n['There\u2019s no .NET server-side dependency. The app is fully functioning after downloaded to the\\nclient.', 'Client resources and capabilities are fully leveraged.', 'Work is offloaded from the server to the client.', 'An ASP.NET Core web server isn\u2019t required to host the app. Serverless deployment scenarios\\nare possible (for example, serving the app from a CDN).']\n\nThe downsides of the Blazor WebAssembly hosting model are:\n\n['Browser capabilities restrict the app.', 'Capable client hardware and software (for example, WebAssembly support) is required.', 'Download size is larger, and apps take longer to load.']\n\n10 CHAPTER 3 | Blazor app hosting models\n\n['[.NET runtime and tooling support is less mature. For example, there are limitations in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard)\\n[Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) support and debugging.']\n\nConversely, the Blazor Server hosting model offers the following benefits:\n\n['Download size is much smaller than a client-side app, and the app loads much faster.', 'The app takes full advantage of server capabilities, including use of any .NET compatible APIs.', '.NET on the server is used to run the app, so existing .NET tooling, such as debugging, works\\nas expected.', 'Thin clients are supported. For example, server-side apps work with browsers that don\u2019t\\nsupport WebAssembly and on resource-constrained devices.', 'The app\u2019s .NET/C# code base, including the app\u2019s component code, isn\u2019t served to clients.']\n\nThe downsides to the Blazor Server hosting model are:\n\n['Higher UI latency. Every user interaction involves a network hop.', 'There\u2019s no offline support. If the client connection fails, the app stops working.', 'Scalability is challenging for apps with many users. The server must manage multiple client\\nconnections and handle client state.', 'An ASP.NET Core server is required to serve the app. Serverless deployment scenarios aren\u2019t\\npossible. For example, you can\u2019t serve the app from a CDN.']\n\nThe preceding list of trade-offs may be intimidating, but your hosting model can be changed later.\nRegardless of the Blazor hosting model selected, the component model is _the same_ . In principle, the\nsame components can be used with either hosting model. Your app code doesn\u2019t change; however,\nit\u2019s a good practice to introduce abstractions so that your components stay hosting model-agnostic.\nThe abstractions allow your app to more easily adopt a different hosting model.", "Deploy your app": "ASP.NET Web Forms apps are typically hosted on IIS on a Windows Server machine or cluster. Blazor\napps can also:\n\n['Be hosted on IIS, either as static files or as an ASP.NET Core app.', 'Leverage ASP.NET Core\u2019s flexibility to be hosted on various platforms and server\\n[infrastructures.

Since the\nrelease of .NET 5, both Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly apps can easily share one unified\nruntime.\n\nAlthough they\u2019re supported, individual assembly references are less common in .NET projects. Most\nproject dependencies are handled as NuGet package references. You only need to reference top-level\npackage dependencies in .NET projects. Transitive dependencies are included automatically. Instead of\nusing the _packages.config_ file commonly found in ASP.NET Web Forms projects to reference packages,\npackage references are added to the project file using the <PackageReference> element.", "Entry point": "The Blazor Server app\u2019s entry point is defined in the _Program.cs_ file, as you would see in a Console\napp. When the app executes, it creates and runs a web host instance using defaults specific to web\napps. The web host manages the Blazor Server app\u2019s lifecycle and sets up host-level services.\nExamples of such services are configuration, logging, dependency injection, and the HTTP server. This\ncode is mostly boilerplate and is often left unchanged.\n\n13 CHAPTER 4 | Project structure for Blazor apps\n\nBlazor WebAssembly apps also define an entry point in _Program.cs_ . The code looks slightly different.\nThe code is similar in that it\u2019s setting up the app host to provide the same host-level services to the\napp. The WebAssembly app host doesn\u2019t, however, set up an HTTP server because it executes directly\nin the browser.\n\nBlazor apps don\u2019t use a _Global.asax_ file to define the startup logic for the app. Instead, this logic is\ncontained in _Program.cs_ or in a related Startup class that is referenced from _Program.cs_ . Either way,\nthis code is used to configure the app and any app-specific services.\n\nIn a Blazor Server app, the _Program.cs_ file shown is used to set up the endpoint for the real-time\nconnection used by Blazor between the client browsers and the server.\n\nIn a Blazor WebAssembly app, the _Program.cs_ file defines the root components for the app and where\nthey should be rendered:\n\n14 CHAPTER 4 | Project structure for Blazor apps", "Static files": "Unlike ASP.NET Web Forms projects, not all files in a Blazor project can be requested as static files.\nOnly the files in the _wwwroot_ folder are web-addressable.

Razor is a templating language based on HTML and C#\nthat is used to dynamically generate web UI. The _.razor_ files define components that make up the UI\nof the app. For the most part, the components are identical for both the Blazor Server and Blazor\nWebAssembly apps. Components in Blazor are analogous to user controls in ASP.NET Web Forms.\n\nEach Razor component file is compiled into a .NET class when the project is built. The generated class\ncaptures the component\u2019s state, rendering logic, lifecycle methods, event handlers, and other logic.\nYou\u2019ll learn more about authoring components in the Building reusable UI components with Blazor\nsection.\n\nThe *_Imports.razor* files aren\u2019t Razor component files. Instead, they define a set of Razor directives to\nimport into other _.razor_ files within the same folder and in its subfolders.

Blazor doesn\u2019t define a separate file extension for\naddressable pages, like the _.aspx_ files in ASP.NET Web Forms apps. Instead, pages are defined by\nassigning routes to components.

For\nexample, the Counter component authored in the _Pages/Counter.razor_ file defines the following route:\n\n```\n@page \"/counter\"\n\n```\n\nRouting in Blazor is handled client-side, not on the server.

RouteConfig in the default project template adds the FriendlyUrlSettings for web forms to\nallow application URLs to omit the .ASPX file extension. The default template also contains a directive\nthat provides permanent HTTP redirect status codes (HTTP 301) for the .ASPX pages to the friendly\nURL with the file name that omits the extension.\n\nWith ASP.NET Core and Blazor, these methods are either simplified and consolidated into the Startup\nclass or they are eliminated in favor of common web technologies.", "Blazor Server Startup Structure": "Blazor Server applications reside on top of an ASP.NET Core 3.0 or later version. ASP.NET Core web\napplications are configured in _Program.cs_, or through a pair of methods in the Startup.cs class. A\nsample _Program.cs_ file is shown below:\n\n21 CHAPTER 5 | App startup\n\nThe app\u2019s required services are added to the WebApplicationBuilder instance\u2019s Services collection.\nThis is how the various ASP.NET Core framework services are configured with the framework\u2019s built-in\ndependency injection container. The various builder.Services.Add* methods add services that enable\nfeatures such as authentication, razor pages, MVC controller routing, SignalR, and Blazor Server\ninteractions among many others. This method was not needed in web forms, as the parsing and\nhandling of the ASPX, ASCX, ASHX, and ASMX files were defined by referencing ASP.NET in the\nweb.config configuration file. More information about dependency injection in ASP.NET Core is\n[available in the online documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection)\n\nAfter the app has been built by the builder, the rest of the calls on app configure its HTTP pipeline.\nWith these calls, we declare from top to bottom the Middleware that will handle every request sent to\nour application. Most of these features in the default configuration were scattered across the web\nforms configuration files and are now in one place for ease of reference.\n\nNo longer is the configuration of the custom error page placed in a web.config file, but now is\nconfigured to always be shown if the application environment is not labeled Development.\nAdditionally, ASP.NET Core applications are now configured to serve secure pages with TLS by default\nwith the UseHttpsRedirection method call.\n\nNext, an unexpected configuration method call is made to UseStaticFiles. In ASP.NET Core, support for\nrequests for static files (like JavaScript, CSS, and image files) must be explicitly enabled, and only files\nin the app\u2019s _wwwroot_ folder are publicly addressable by default.\n\nThe next line is the first that replicates one of the configuration options from web forms: UseRouting.\nThis method adds the ASP.NET Core router to the pipeline and it can be either configured here or in\nthe individual files that it can consider routing to. More information about routing configuration can\nbe found in the Routing section.\n\nThe final app.Map* calls in this section define the endpoints that ASP.NET Core is listening on. These\nroutes are the web accessible locations that you can access on the web server and receive some\ncontent handled by .NET and returned to you. The first entry, MapBlazorHub configures a SignalR hub\nfor use in providing the real-time and persistent connection to the server where the state and\nrendering of Blazor components is handled. The MapFallbackToPage method call indicates the webaccessible location of the page that starts the Blazor application and also configures the application to\n\n22 CHAPTER 5 | App startup\n\nhandle deep-linking requests from the client-side. You will see this feature at work if you open a\nbrowser and navigate directly to Blazor handled route in your application, such as /counter in the\ndefault project template. The request gets handled by the *_Host.cshtml* fallback page, which then\nruns the Blazor router and renders the counter page.\n\nThe very last line starts the application, something that wasn\u2019t required in web forms (since it relied on\nIIS to be running).", "Upgrading the BundleConfig Process": "Technologies for bundling assets like CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files have changed significantly,\nwith other technologies providing quickly evolving tools and techniques for managing these\nresources. To this end, we recommend using a Node command-line tool such as Grunt / Gulp /\nWebPack to package your static assets.\n\nThe Grunt, Gulp, and WebPack command-line tools and their associated configurations can be added\nto your application and ASP.NET Core will quietly ignore those files during the application build\nprocess. You can add a call to run their tasks by adding a Target inside your project file with syntax\nsimilar to the following that would trigger a gulp script and the min target inside that script:\n\n[More details about both strategies to manage your CSS and JavaScript files are available in the Bundle](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/client-side/bundling-and-minification)\n[and minify static assets in ASP.NET Core documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/client-side/bundling-and-minification)\n\n23 CHAPTER 5 | App startup\n\n**CHAPTER**"}}, "6": {"Build reusable UI components with Blazor": {"An introduction to Razor": "Razor is a light-weight markup templating language based on HTML and C#. With Razor, you can\nseamlessly transition between markup and C# code to define your component rendering logic. When\nthe _.razor_ file is compiled, the rendering logic is captured in a structured way in a .NET class. The name\nof the compiled class is taken from the _.razor_ file name. The namespace is taken from the default\nnamespace for the project and the folder path, or you can explicitly specify the namespace using the\n@namespace directive (more on Razor directives below).\n\nA component\u2019s rendering logic is authored using normal HTML markup with dynamic logic added\nusing C#. The @ character is used to transition to C#. Razor is typically smart about figuring out when\nyou\u2019ve switched back to HTML. For example, the following component renders a <p> tag with the\ncurrent time:\n\n```\n<p>@DateTime.Now</p>\n\n```\n\nTo explicitly specify the beginning and ending of a C# expression, use parentheses:\n\n```\n<p>@(DateTime.Now)</p>\n\n```\n\nRazor also makes it easy to use C# control flow in your rendering logic. For example, you can\nconditionally render some HTML like this:\n\n24 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor\n\nOr you can generate a list of items using a normal C# foreach loop like this:\n\nRazor directives, like directives in ASP.NET Web Forms, control many aspects of how a Razor\ncomponent is compiled. Examples include the component\u2019s:\n\n['Namespace', 'Base class', 'Implemented interfaces', 'Generic parameters', 'Imported namespaces', 'Routes']\n\nRazor directives start with the @ character and are typically used at the start of a new line at the start\nof the file. For example, the @namespace directive defines the component\u2019s namespace:\n\n```\n@namespace MyComponentNamespace\n\n```\n\nThe following table summarizes the various Razor directives used in Blazor and their ASP.NET Web\n\n|Forms equivalents, if they|exist.|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|**Directive**|**Description**|**Example**|**Web Forms equivalent**|\n|@attribute|Adds a class-level<br>attribute to the<br>component|@attribute<br>[Authorize]|None|\n|@code|Adds class<br>members to the<br>component|@code { ... }|<script runat=\"server\">...</script>|\n|@implements|Implements the<br>specified interface|@impleme<br>nts<br>IDisposable|Use code-behind|\n|@inherits|Inherits from the<br>specified base class|@inherits<br>MyCompon<br>entBase|<%@ Control<br>Inherits=\"MyUserControlBase\" %>|\n|@inject|Injects a service<br>into the component|@inject<br>IJSRuntime<br>JS|None|\n\n25 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor\n\n|Directive|Description|Example|Web Forms equivalent|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|@layout|Specifies a layout<br>component for the<br>component|@layout<br>MainLayout|<%@ Page<br>MasterPageFile=\"~/Site.Master\" %>|\n|@namespace|Sets the namespace<br>for the component|@namespa<br>ce<br>MyNamesp<br>ace|None|\n|@page|Specifies the route<br>for the component|@page<br>\"/product/{i<br>d}\"|<%@ Page %>|\n|@typeparam|Specifies a generic<br>type parameter for<br>the component|@typepara<br>m TItem|Use code-behind|\n|@using|Specifies a<br>namespace to bring<br>into scope|@using<br>MyCompon<br>entNamesp<br>ace|Add namespace in_web.config_|\n\nRazor components also make extensive use of _directive attributes_ on elements to control various\naspects of how components get compiled (event handling, data binding, component & element\nreferences, and so on). Directive attributes all follow a common generic syntax where the values in\nparenthesis are optional:\n\n```\n@directive(-suffix(:name))(=\"value\")\n\n```\n\nThe following table summarizes the various attributes for Razor directives used in Blazor.\n\n|Attribute|Description|Example|\n|---|---|---|\n|@attributes|Renders a dictionary of attributes|<input<br>@attributes=\"ExtraA<br>ttributes\" />|\n|@bind|Creates a two-way data binding|<input<br>@bind=\"username\"<br>@bind:event=\"oninp<br>ut\" />|\n|@on{event}|Adds an event handler for the<br>specified event|<button<br>@onclick=\"Incremen<br>tCount\">Click<br>me!</button>|\n|@key|Specifies a key to be used by the<br>diffing algorithm for preserving<br>elements in a collection|<DetailsEditor<br>@key=\"person\"<br>Details=\"person.Det<br>ails\" />|\n\n26 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor\n\n|Attribute|Description|Example|\n|---|---|---|\n|@ref|Captures a reference to the<br>component or HTML element|<MyDialog<br>@ref=\"myDialog\" />|\n\nThe various directive attributes used by Blazor (@onclick, @bind, @ref, and so on) are covered in the\nsections below and later chapters.\n\nMany of the syntaxes used in _.aspx_ and _.ascx_ files have parallel syntaxes in Razor. Below is a simple\ncomparison of the syntaxes for ASP.NET Web Forms and Razor.\n\n|Feature|Web Forms|Syntax|Razor|Synt<br>ax|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Directives|<%@ [directive] %>|<%@ Page %>|@[directive]|@pa<br>ge|\n|Code blocks|<% %>|<% int x = 123; %>|@{ }|@{<br>int x<br>= <br>123; }|\n|Expressions<br>(HTML-encoded)|<%: %>|<%:DateTime.Now<br>%>|Implicit: @<br>Explicit: @()|@Da<br>teTi<br>me.N<br>ow<br>@(Da<br>teTi<br>me.N<br>ow)|\n|Comments|<%-- --%>|<%-- Commented --<br>%>|@* *@|@*<br>Com<br>ment<br>ed<br>*@|\n|Data binding|<%# %>|<%# Bind(\"Name\")<br>%>|@bind|<inp<br>ut<br>@bin<br>d=\"u<br>serna<br>me\"<br>/>|\n\nTo add members to the Razor component class, use the @code directive. This technique is similar to\nusing a <script runat=\"server\">...</script> block in an ASP.NET Web Forms user control or page.\n\n27 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor\n\nBecause Razor is based on C#, it must be compiled from within a C# project ( _.csproj_ ). You can\u2019t\ncompile _.razor_ files from a Visual Basic project ( _.vbproj_ ). You can still reference Visual Basic projects\nfrom your Blazor project. The opposite is true too.\n\n[For a full Razor syntax reference, see Razor syntax reference for ASP.NET Core.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor)", "Use components": "Aside from normal HTML, components can also use other components as part of their rendering logic.\nThe syntax for using a component in Razor is similar to using a user control in an ASP.NET Web Forms\napp. Components are specified using an element tag that matches the type name of the component.\nFor example, you can add a Counter component like this:\n\n```\n<Counter />\n\n```\n\nUnlike ASP.NET Web Forms, components in Blazor:\n\n['Don\u2019t use an element prefix (for example, asp:).', 'Don\u2019t require registration on the page or in the _web.config_ .']\n\nThink of Razor components like you would .NET types, because that\u2019s exactly what they are. If the\nassembly containing the component is referenced, then the component is available for use. To bring\nthe component\u2019s namespace into scope, apply the @using directive:\n\nAs seen in the default Blazor projects, it\u2019s common to put @using directives into a *_Imports.razor* file\nso that they\u2019re imported into all _.razor_ files in the same directory and in child directories.\n\nIf the namespace for a component isn\u2019t in scope, you can specify a component using its full type\nname, as you can in C#:\n\n```\n<MyComponentLib.Counter />\n\n### Modify page title from components\n\n```\n\nWhen building SPA-style apps, it\u2019s common for parts of a page to reload without reloading the entire\npage. Even so, it can be useful to have the title of the page change based on which component is\ncurrently loaded. This can be accomplished by including the <PageTitle> tag in the component\u2019s\nRazor page:\n\nThe contents of this element can be dynamic, for instance showing the current count of messages:\n\n28 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor\n\n```\n<PageTitle>@MessageCount messages</PageTitle>\n\n```\n\nNote that if several components on a particular page include <PageTitle> tags, only the last one will\nbe displayed (since each one will overwrite the previous one).", "Component parameters": "In ASP.NET Web Forms, you can flow parameters and data to controls using public properties. These\nproperties can be set in markup using attributes or set directly in code. Razor components work in a\nsimilar fashion, although the component properties must also be marked with the [Parameter]\nattribute to be considered component parameters.\n\nThe following Counter component defines a component parameter called IncrementAmount that can\nbe used to specify the amount that the Counter should be incremented each time the button is\nclicked.\n\nTo specify a component parameter in Blazor, use an attribute as you would in ASP.NET Web Forms:\n\n```\n<Counter IncrementAmount=\"10\" />\n\n#### **Query string parameters**\n\n```\n\nRazor components can also leverage values from the query string of the page they\u2019re rendered on as\na parameter source. To enable this, add the [SupplyParameterFromQuery] attribute to the parameter.\nFor example, the following parameter definition would get its value from the request in the form\n?IncBy=2:\n\nIf you don\u2019t supply a custom Name in the [SupplyParameterFromQuery] attribute, by default it will\nmatch the property name (IncrementAmount in this case).\n\n29 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor", "Components and error boundaries": "By default, Blazor apps will detect unhandled exceptions and show an error message at the bottom of\nthe page with no additional detail. To constrain the parts of the app that are impacted by an\nunhandled error, for instance to limit the impact to a single component, the <ErrorBoundary> tag can\nbe wrapped around component declarations.\n\nFor example, to protect against possible exceptions thrown from the Counter component, declare it\nwithin an <ErrorBoundary> and optionally specify a message to display if there is an exception:\n\nA default message stating \u201cAn error as occurred.\u201d will be displayed if an unhandled exception occurs\nin the wrapped component.", "Event handlers": "Both ASP.NET Web Forms and Blazor provide an event-based programming model for handling UI\nevents. Examples of such events include button clicks and text input. In ASP.NET Web Forms, you use\nHTML server controls to handle UI events exposed by the DOM, or you can handle events exposed by\nweb server controls. The events are surfaced on the server through form post-back requests. Consider\nthe following Web Forms button click example:\n\n_Counter.ascx_\n\nIn Blazor, you can register handlers for DOM UI events directly using directive attributes of the form\n@on{event}. The {event} placeholder represents the name of the event. For example, you can listen for\nbutton clicks like this:\n\n30 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor\n\nEvent handlers can accept an optional, event-specific argument to provide more information about\nthe event. For example, mouse events can take a MouseEventArgs argument, but it isn\u2019t required.\n\nInstead of referring to a method group for an event handler, you can use a lambda expression. A\nlambda expression allows you to close over other in-scope values.\n\nEvent handlers can execute synchronously or asynchronously. For example, the following OnClick\nevent handler executes asynchronously:\n\nAfter an event is handled, the component is rendered to account for any component state changes.\nWith asynchronous event handlers, the component is rendered immediately after the handler\nexecution completes. The component is rendered _again_ after the asynchronous Task completes. This\nasynchronous execution mode provides an opportunity to render some appropriate UI while the\nasynchronous Task is still in progress.\n\n31 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor\n\nComponents can also define their own events by defining a component parameter of type\nEventCallback<TValue>. Event callbacks support all the variations of DOM UI event handlers: optional\narguments, synchronous or asynchronous, method groups, or lambda expressions.", "Data binding": "Blazor provides a simple mechanism to bind data from a UI component to the component\u2019s state. This\napproach differs from the features in ASP.NET Web Forms for binding data from data sources to UI\ncontrols. We\u2019ll cover handling data from different data sources in the Dealing with data section.\n\nTo create a two-way data binding from a UI component to the component\u2019s state, use the @bind\ndirective attribute. In the following example, the value of the check box is bound to the isChecked\nfield.\n\nWhen the component is rendered, the value of the checkbox is set to the value of the isChecked field.\nWhen the user toggles the checkbox, the onchange event is fired and the isChecked field is set to the\nnew value. The @bind syntax in this case is equivalent to the following markup:\n\n```\n<input value=\"@isChecked\" @onchange=\"(UIChangeEventArgs e) => isChecked = e.Value\" />\n\n```\n\nTo change the event used for the bind, use the @bind:event attribute.\n\n32 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor\n\nComponents can also support data binding to their parameters. To data bind, define an event callback\nparameter with the same name as the bindable parameter. The \u201cChanged\u201d suffix is added to the\nname.\n\n_PasswordBox.razor_\n\nTo chain a data binding to an underlying UI element, set the value and handle the event directly on\nthe UI element instead of using the @bind attribute.\n\nTo bind to a component parameter, use a @bind-{Parameter} attribute to specify the parameter to\nwhich you want to bind.", "State changes": "If the component\u2019s state has changed outside of a normal UI event or event callback, then the\ncomponent must manually signal that it needs to be rendered again. To signal that a component\u2019s\nstate has changed, call the StateHasChanged method on the component.\n\nIn the example below, a component displays a message from an AppState service that can be updated\nby other parts of the app. The component registers its StateHasChanged method with the\nAppState.OnChange event so that the component is rendered whenever the message gets updated.\n\n33 CHAPTER 6 | Build reusable UI components with Blazor", "Component lifecycle": {"**OnInitialized**": "The OnInitialized and OnInitializedAsync methods are used to initialize the component.

The OnInitialized method is similar to the Page_Load\nevent in ASP.NET Web Forms pages and controls.", "**OnParametersSet**": "The OnParametersSet and OnParametersSetAsync methods are called when a component has\nreceived parameters from its parent and the value are assigned to properties.

In Blazor, it\u2019s also possible to capture and manipulate a reference to a component, although it\u2019s\nmuch less common.\n\nTo capture a component reference in Blazor, use the @ref directive attribute. The value of the\nattribute should match the name of a settable field with the same type as the referenced component.\n\nWhen the parent component is rendered, the field is populated with the child component instance.\nYou can then call methods on, or otherwise manipulate, the component instance.\n\nManipulating component state directly using component references isn\u2019t recommended.

This limitation of Blazor layout components will hopefully be addressed in a future release.\n\nMaster Pages in ASP.NET Web Forms can be nested. That is, a Master Page may also use a Master\nPage.

In Web Forms, ViewState manages the state of the content between HTTP requests\nby sending a large encoded block of text back and forth to the browser. The ViewState field could be\noverwhelmed with content from a page containing many elements, potentially expanding to several\nmegabytes in size.\n\nWith Blazor Server, the app maintains an ongoing connection with the server. The app\u2019s state, called a\n_circuit_, is held in server memory while the connection is considered active. State will only be disposed\nwhen the user navigates away from the app or a particular page in the app. All members of the active\ncomponents are available between interactions with the server.\n\nThere are several advantages of this feature:\n\n['Component state is readily available and not rebuilt between interactions.', 'State isn\u2019t transmitted to the browser.']\n\nHowever, there are some disadvantages to in-memory component state persistence to be aware of:\n\n['If the server restarts between request, state is lost.', 'Your application web server load-balancing solution must include sticky sessions to ensure\\nthat all requests from the same browser return to the same server. If a request goes to a\\ndifferent server, state will be lost.', 'Persistence of component state on the server can lead to memory pressure on the web server.']\n\nFor the preceding reasons, don\u2019t rely on just the state of the component to reside in-memory on the\nserver. Your application should also include some backing data store for data between requests. Some\nsimple examples of this strategy:\n\n['In a shopping cart application, persist the content of new items added to the cart in a\\ndatabase record.

The AuthorizeView component selectively](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/security#authorizeview-component)\ndisplays UI depending on whether the user is authorized to see it.

The server-side model uses ASP.NET Core SignalR connections to manage the\nDOM updates while running any actual code on the server. The client-side model runs as\nWebAssembly within a browser and requires no server connections. There are a number of differences\nthat may affect which is best for a specific app:\n\n['Running as WebAssembly doesn\u2019t support all features (such as threading) at the current time', 'Chatty communication between the client and server may cause latency issues in server-side\\nmode']\n\n78 CHAPTER 14 | Migrate from ASP.NET Web Forms to Blazor\n\n['Access to databases and internal or protected services require a separate service with clientside hosting']\n\nAt the time of writing, the server-side model more closely resembles Web Forms.

This project type is based on the SDK style\nprojects of .NET and simplifies much of the boilerplate that was used in previous project formats. For\nmore detail, please see the chapter on Project Structure.\n\nOnce the project has been created, install the libraries that were used in the previous project. In older\nWeb Forms projects, you may have used the _packages.config_ file to list the required NuGet packages.\nIn the new SDK-style project, _packages.config_ has been replaced with <PackageReference> elements\nin the project file. A benefit to this approach is that all dependencies are installed transitively. You only\nlist the top-level dependencies you care about.\n\nMany of the dependencies you\u2019re using are available for .NET, including Entity Framework 6 and\nlog4net. If there\u2019s no .NET or .NET Standard version available, the .NET Framework version can often\nbe used. Your mileage may vary. Any API used that isn\u2019t available in .NET causes a runtime error. Visual\nStudio notifies you of such packages. A yellow icon appears on the project\u2019s **References** node in\n**Solution Explorer** .\n\nIn the Blazor-based eShop project, you can see the packages that are installed. Previously, the\n_packages.config_ file listed every package used in the project, resulting in a file almost 50 lines long. A\nsnippet of _packages.config_ is:\n\n79 CHAPTER 14 | Migrate from ASP.NET Web Forms to Blazor\n\nThe <packages> element includes all necessary dependencies. It\u2019s difficult to identify which of these\npackages are included because you require them. Some <package> elements are listed simply to\nsatisfy the needs of dependencies you require.\n\nThe Blazor project lists the dependencies you require within an <ItemGroup> element in the project\nfile:\n\n[One NuGet package that simplifies the life of Web Forms developers is the Windows Compatibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/windows-compat-pack)\n[Pack. Although .NET is cross-platform, some features are only available on Windows. Windows-](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/windows-compat-pack)\nspecific features are made available by installing the compatibility pack. Examples of such features\ninclude the Registry, WMI, and Directory Services. The package adds around 20,000 APIs and activates\nmany services with which you may already be familiar. The eShop project doesn\u2019t require the\ncompatibility pack; but if your projects use Windows-specific features, the package eases the\nmigration efforts.", "Enable startup process": "The startup process for Blazor has changed from Web Forms and follows a similar setup for other\nASP.NET Core services. When hosted server-side, Razor components are run as part of a normal\nASP.NET Core app. When hosted in the browser with WebAssembly, Razor components use a similar\nhosting model. The difference is the components are run as a separate service from any of the\nbackend processes. Either way, the startup is similar.\n\nThe _Global.asax.cs_ file is the default startup page for Web Forms projects. In the eShop project, this file\nconfigures the Inversion of Control (IoC) container and handles the various lifecycle events of the app\nor request. Some of these events are handled with middleware (such as Application_BeginRequest).\nOther events require the overriding of specific services via dependency injection (DI).\n\nBy way of example, the _Global.asax.cs_ file for eShop, contains the following code:\n\n80 CHAPTER 14 | Migrate from ASP.NET Web Forms to Blazor\n\nThe preceding file becomes the _Program.cs_ file in server-side Blazor:\n\n81 CHAPTER 14 | Migrate from ASP.NET Web Forms to Blazor\n\n82 CHAPTER 14 | Migrate from ASP.NET Web Forms to Blazor\n\nOne significant change you may notice from Web Forms is the prominence of dependency injection\n(DI). DI has been a guiding principle in the ASP.NET Core design. It supports customization of almost\nall aspects of the ASP.NET Core framework. There\u2019s even a built-in service provider that can be used\nfor many scenarios. If more customization is required, it can be supported by many community\nprojects. For example, you can carry forward your third-party DI library investment.\n\nIn the original eShop app, there\u2019s some configuration for session management. Since server-side\nBlazor uses ASP.NET Core SignalR for communication, the session state isn\u2019t supported as the\nconnections may occur independent of an HTTP context. An app that uses the session state requires\nrearchitecting before running as a Blazor app.\n\nFor more information about app startup, see App startup.", "Migrate HTTP modules and handlers to middleware": "HTTP modules and handlers are common patterns in Web Forms to control the HTTP request pipeline.\nClasses that implement IHttpModule or IHttpHandler could be registered and process incoming\nrequests. Web Forms configure modules and handlers in the _web.config_ file. Web Forms is also heavily\nbased on app lifecycle event handling. ASP.NET Core uses middleware instead. Middleware is\nregistered in the Configure method of the Startup class. Middleware execution order is determined by\nthe registration order.\n\nIn the Enable startup process section, a lifecycle event was raised by Web Forms as the\nApplication_BeginRequest method. This event isn\u2019t available in ASP.NET Core. One way to achieve this\nbehavior is to implement middleware as seen in the _Startup.cs_ file example. This middleware does the\nsame logic and then transfers control to the next handler in the middleware pipeline.\n\n[For more information on migrating modules and handlers, see Migrate HTTP handlers and modules to](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/http-modules)\n[ASP.NET Core middleware.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/http-modules)\n\n83 CHAPTER 14 | Migrate from ASP.NET Web Forms to Blazor", "Migrate static files": "To serve static files (for example, HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript), the files must be exposed by\nmiddleware. Calling the UseStaticFiles method enables the serving of static files from the web root\npath. The default web root directory is _wwwroot_, but it can be customized. As included in the\n_Program.cs_ file:\n\nThe eShop project enables basic static file access. There are many customizations available for static\n[file access.

The optimization conventions are defined an _App_Start/BundleConfig.cs_ file.\nIn ASP.NET Core, a more declarative approach is adopted. A file lists the files to be minified, along\nwith specific minification settings.\n\n[For more information on bundling and minification, see Bundle and minify static assets in ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/client-side/bundling-and-minification)\n[Core.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/client-side/bundling-and-minification)", "Migrate ASPX pages": {"**Model validation in Blazor**": "If your Web Forms code includes validation, you can transfer much of what you have with little-to-no\nchanges.

An example snippet would\nlook like this:\n\nIn Blazor, the equivalent markup is provided in a _Create.razor_ file:\n\nThe EditForm context includes validation support and can be wrapped around an input.

The\nconfiguration data is accessed with ConfigurationManager. Services were often required to parse\nobjects. With .NET Framework 4.7.2, composability was added to the configuration via\nConfigurationBuilders. These builders allowed developers to add various sources for the configuration\nthat was then composed at run time to retrieve the necessary values.\n\nASP.NET Core introduced a flexible configuration system that allows you to define the configuration\nsource or sources used by your app and deployment. The ConfigurationBuilder infrastructure that you\nmay be using in your Web Forms app was modeled after the concepts used in the ASP.NET Core\nconfiguration system.\n\nThe following snippet demonstrates how the Web Forms eShop project uses _web.config_ to store\nconfiguration values:\n\n89 CHAPTER 14 | Migrate from ASP.NET Web Forms to Blazor\n\nIt\u2019s common for secrets, such as database connection strings, to be stored within the _web.config_ . The\nsecrets are inevitably persisted in unsecure locations, such as source control. With Blazor on ASP.NET\nCore, the preceding XML-based configuration is replaced with the following JSON:\n\nJSON is the default configuration format; however, ASP.NET Core supports many other formats,\nincluding XML. There are also several community-supported formats.\n\nYou can access configuration values from the builder in _Program.cs_ :\n\nBy default, environment variables, JSON files ( _appsettings.json_ and _appsettings.{Environment}.json_ ), and\ncommand-line options are registered as valid configuration sources in the configuration object. The\nconfiguration sources can be accessed via Configuration[key]. A more advanced technique is to bind\nthe configuration data to objects using the options pattern.
