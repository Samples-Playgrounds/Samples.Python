Additionally, the default configuration system further overrides all file-based settings with any environment variable that exists for the same named setting.

    "In ASP.NET Core apps, configuration is, itself, configurable. However, most apps use a set of defaults provided as part of the standard project templates and the ConfigureWebHostDefaults method used in them. The default settings use JSON formatted files, with the ability to override settings in the base appsettings.json file with environment-specific files like appsettings.Development.json. Additionally, the default configuration system further overrides all file-based settings with any environment variable that exists for the same named setting. This is useful in many scenarios and is especially useful when deploying to a hosting environment, since it eliminates the need to worry about whether deploying configuration files will accidentally overwrite important production configuration settings.

    "ASP.NET Core controllers can be unit tested just like ASP.NET MVC controllers, but with the same limitations. However, ASP.NET Core supports fast, easy-to-author integration tests as well. Integration tests are hosted by a TestHost class and are typically configured in a custom WebApplicationFactory that can override or replace app dependencies. For instance, frequently during integration tests the app will target a different data source and may replace services that send emails with fake or mock implementations.",
