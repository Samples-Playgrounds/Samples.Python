There are quite\na few, so don\u2019t consider this list exhaustive.\n\n**Cross-platform support**\n\nApps built on .NET Core are truly cross-platform and can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Not only\ncan your developers use whatever hardware they want, but you can also host your app anywhere.\nExamples range from local IIS to Azure in the cloud or from Linux Docker containers to IoT devices.\n\n**Performance and scalability**\n\n[Apps built with .NET Core are running on one of the fastest tech stacks available anywhere. ASP.NET](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#hw=ph&test=plaintext)\nMVC apps often see performance improvements on ASP.NET Core, especially if they\u2019re updated to\ntake advantage of some new features available in .NET Core.\n\n**Cloud-native**\n\nFor the above reasons and others, .NET Core apps are well-suited to running in cloud hosting\nenvironments. Lightweight and fast, .NET Core apps can be deployed to Azure App Services or\ncontainers and scaled horizontally as needed to meet immediate system demand.\n\n**Maintainable**\n\nFor many apps, while they\u2019ve continued to meet customer and business needs, technical debt has\naccumulated and maintaining the app has grown expensive. ASP.NET Core apps are more easily\ntested than ASP.NET MVC apps, making them easier to refactor and extend with confidence.\n\n**Modular**\n\nASP.NET Core is modular, using NuGet packages as a first-class part of the framework. Apps built for\n.NET Core all support dependency injection, making it easy to compose solutions from whatever\nimplementations are needed for a given environment. Building microservices with .NET Core is easier\n\n2 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to porting apps to .NET 7\n\nthan with ASP.NET MVC with its dependency on IIS, which opens up additional options to break up\nlarge apps into smaller modules.\n\n**Modern**\n\nStaying on a modern, actively developed technology stack has a host of advantages. New features\nand C# language features will only be added to .NET Core. The .NET Framework has had its last\nrelease with version 4.8, and versions of C# beyond 8 won\u2019t target .NET Framework. While ASP.NET\nMVC will remain supported by Microsoft for many years, the best and brightest .NET software\ndevelopers are likely looking to use the more modern .NET Core framework, with all of the advantages\nit offers (only some of which are summarized above). Finding developers with the skills to maintain an\nASP.NET MVC app will start to become a challenge at some point, as will finding online training and\ntroubleshooting assistance. There probably aren\u2019t that many new blog posts being written about\nASP.NET MVC 5, while there are plenty being written for .NET 7, for example.\n\nThere are many compelling reasons to consider migrating to .NET Core, which presumably is why\nyou\u2019re reading this book! But let\u2019s consider some disadvantages and reasons why it may make more\nsense to remain on the .NET Framework.", "**When is .NET Framework appropriate?**": "The biggest reason to stay on .NET Framework is when an app isn\u2019t under active development and\nwouldn\u2019t benefit substantially from the advantages listed above. In that case, there probably isn\u2019t a\ngood business case to incur the cost of porting the app. If your app might benefit from the\nadvantages .NET Core offers, you may still need to stay on .NET Framework if you need certain\n[technologies that are unavailable on .NET Core. There are some .NET technologies that are unavailable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/net-framework-tech-unavailable)\n[on .NET Core, including AppDomains, Remoting, Code Access Security (CAS), Security Transparency,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/net-framework-tech-unavailable)\nand System.EnterpriseServices. A brief summary of these technologies and their alternatives is\nincluded here. For more detailed guidance, see the documentation.\n\n**Application domains**\n\nApplication domains (AppDomains) isolate apps from one another. AppDomains require runtime\nsupport and can be expensive. Creating additional app domains isn\u2019t supported, and there are no\nplans to add this capability to .NET Core in the future. For code isolation, use separate processes or\ncontainers as an alternative. Some customers use AppDomains as a way of unloading assemblies. In\n[.NET Core AssemblyLoadContext provides an alternative way to unload assemblies.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/unloadability)\n\n**WCF**\n\n[.NET Core and .NET 5+ support WCF clients. Server-side WCF is possible through CoreWCF, which is](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/corewcf)\nofficially supported by Microsoft as of April 2022. Apps that require server-side WCF functionality can\nalso consider a different communication technology (such as gRPC or REST) as part of a migration.\n\n[There is a WCF client port available from the .NET Foundation. It\u2019s entirely open source, cross](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-5#windows-communication-foundation)\nplatform, and supported by Microsoft.\n\n[To learn more about migrating from WCF to gRPC, consult the gRPC for WCF Developers ebook.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/)\n\n3 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to porting apps to .NET 7\n\n**Remoting**\n\n.NET Remoting was identified as a problematic architecture. It\u2019s used for cross-AppDomain\ncommunication, which is no longer supported. Also, Remoting requires runtime support, which is\nexpensive to maintain. For these reasons, .NET Remoting isn\u2019t supported on .NET Core, and the\nproduct team doesn\u2019t plan on adding support for it in the future. There are several alternative\nmessaging strategies and implementations you can use to replace remoting in your .NET Core apps.\n\n**Code Access Security (CAS) and Security Transparency**\n\nNeither of these technologies are supported by .NET Core. Instead, the recommendation is to use\nsecurity boundaries provided by the operating system. For example, virtualization, containers, or user\naccounts. Run processes with the minimal set of privileges necessary.", "**References**": "[.NET Framework Technologies Unavailable on .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/net-framework-tech-unavailable)"}, "Migrate to ASP.NET Core 2.1": {"**Should apps run on .NET Framework with ASP.NET Core 2.1**": "ASP.NET Core 2.2 and earlier supported both .NET Core and .NET Framework runtimes. Does it make\nsense to migrate some or all of an app to ASP.NET Core 2.1 as a stepping stone, before porting over\ncompletely to .NET Core? Apps, or subsets of apps, could see their front-end ASP.NET logic ported to\nuse ASP.NET Core, while still consuming .NET Framework libraries for business logic and infrastructure\nconsumption. This approach may make sense when there\u2019s a relatively thin UI layer without much\nbusiness logic, and a much larger set of functionality in class libraries.\n\nThe main benefit of porting just the front-end web layer to ASP.NET Core 2.1 is that the existing .NET\nclass libraries can remain as is during the initial migration. They may be in continued use by other\n.NET apps or simply don\u2019t need to be in scope for the first iteration of a planned full migration to .NET\nCore. Reducing the scope of the initial migration for large apps helps provide incremental goals that\nact as stepping stones toward the desired end state, which is often a complete port to .NET Core.\n\nIf you have an existing app that may use this strategy, some things you can do today to help prepare\nfor the process are to move as much business logic, data access, and other non-UI logic out of the\nASP.NET projects and into separate class libraries as possible. It will also help if you have automated\n\n4 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to porting apps to .NET 7\n\ntest coverage of your system, so that you can verify behavior remains consistent before and after the\nmigration.\n\nIf your app is so large that you can\u2019t migrate the entire web app at once, and you need to be able to\ndeploy the new ASP.NET Core app side-by-side with the existing ASP.NET app, there are deployment\nstrategies that can be used to achieve this. These are covered in Chapter 5: Deployment Scenarios.\n\nKeep in mind that ASP.NET Core 2.1 was the last LTS release of .NET Core that supported running on\n.NET Framework and consuming .NET Framework libraries. Although the release is now unsupported\non .NET Core, it continues to be supported for use with .NET Framework. It will remain supported for\n[as long as the specific .NET Framework version is supported.

The first step is to create a new ASP.NET Core 7 app. Next, identify the\nindividual page or API endpoint that will be migrated first. Build out just the necessary functionality to\nsupport this one route in the new ASP.NET Core app. Then use HTTP rewriting and/or a reverse proxy\nto start sending requests for these pages or endpoints to the new app rather than the ASP.NET app.\nThis approach is well-suited to API projects, but can also work for many MVC apps.\n\nWhen migrating slice by slice, the entire stack of the individual API endpoint or requested route is\nrecreated in the new project or solution. The very first such slice typically requires the most effort,\nsince it will typically need several projects to be created and decisions to be made about data access\nand solution organization. Once the first slice\u2019s functionality mirrors the existing app\u2019s, it can be\ndeployed and the existing app can redirect to it or simply be removed. This approach is then repeated\nuntil the entire app has been ported to the new structure.\n\nSome specific guidance on how to follow this strategy using IIS is covered in Chapter 5, Deployment\nScenarios.", "**Migrating layer by layer**": "Consider the challenge of migrating a large ASP.NET 4.5 app. One approach is to migrate the entire\napp directly from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET 7. However, this approach needs to account for every\nbreaking change between the two frameworks and versions, which are substantial. Performing this\nwork on one project at a time provides a set of stepping stones so that the entire solution doesn\u2019t\nneed to be moved at once.\n\nOne piece of the .NET ecosystem that helps with interoperability between different .NET frameworks is\n[.NET Standard. .NET Standard allows libraries to build against an agreed upon set of common APIs,](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/dotnet-standard)\nensuring they can be used in any .NET app. .NET Standard 2.0 is notable because it covers most base\nclass library functionality used by most .NET Framework and .NET Core apps. Unfortunately, the\nearliest version of .NET with support for .NET Standard 2.0 is .NET Framework 4.6.1, and there are a\nnumber of updates in .NET Framework 4.8 that make it a compelling choice for initial upgrades.\n\nOne approach to incrementally upgrade a .NET Framework 4.5 system layer-by-layer is to first update\nits class library dependencies to .NET Framework 4.8. Then, modify these libraries to be .NET Standard\nclass libraries. Use multi-targeting and conditional compilation, if necessary. This step can be helpful\n\n6 CHAPTER 1 | Introduction to porting apps to .NET 7\n\nin scenarios where app dependencies require .NET Framework and cannot easily be ported directly to\nuse .NET Standard and .NET Core. Since .NET Framework libraries can be consumed by ASP.NET Core\n2.1 apps, the next step is to migrate some or all of the web functionality of the app to ASP.NET Core\n2.1 (as described in the previous chapter). This is a \u201cbottom up\u201d approach, starting with low level class\nlibrary dependencies and working up to the web app entry point.\n\nOnce the app is running on ASP.NET Core 2.1, migrating it to .NET 7 in isolation is relatively\nstraightforward. The most likely challenge during this step is updating incompatible dependencies to\nsupport .NET Core and possibly higher versions of .NET Standard. For apps that don\u2019t have\nproblematic dependencies on .NET Framework-only libraries, there\u2019s little reason to upgrade to\nASP.NET Core 2.1. Porting directly to ASP.NET Core 7 makes more sense and requires less effort.\n\n.NET 7 is the latest version of .NET and will be supported until six months after the next STS or LTS\nrelease (scheduled for November 2023) - so most likely support will last at least until May 2024. Many\nteams looking to migrate today will choose to upgrade to .NET 7.\n\nInstead of a \u201cbottom up\u201d approach, another alternative is to start with the web app (or even the entire\n[solution) and use an automated tool to assist with the upgrade. The .NET Upgrade Assistant tool can](https://aka.ms/dotnet-upgrade-assistant)\nbe used to help upgrade .NET Framework apps to .NET Core / .NET 7. It automates many of the\ncommon tasks related to upgrading apps, such as modifying project file format, setting appropriate\ntarget frameworks, updating NuGet dependencies, and more.", "**References**": ["[What is .NET Standard?](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/dotnet-standard)", "[Migrate from ASP.NET Core 6.0 to 7.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/60-70)", "[Announcing .NET 6 - The Fastest .NET Yet](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6/)", "[Introducing .NET 5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/)", "[Migrate from ASP.NET Core 3.1 to 6.0 LTS](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/31-to-60)", "[.NET Upgrade Assistant tool](https://aka.ms/dotnet-upgrade-assistant)"]}, "Strategies for migrating ASP.NET Web Forms apps": {"**Separate business logic and other concerns**": "The less code in your ASP.NET Web Forms pages, the better.

Four of them are related to ViewBag access and\nreport an error of:\n\nMissing compiler required member 'Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.CSharpArgumentInfo.Create'\n\nTo resolve this error, add a NuGet package reference to C#:\n\n```\n< PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.CSharp\" Version=\"4.7.0\" />\n\n```\n\nThe remaining three errors specify types that are defined in an assembly that isn\u2019t referenced.\nSpecifically these types:\n\n['HttpServerUtilityBase', 'RouteValueDictionary', 'HttpRequestBase']\n\nLet\u2019s look at each error one by one. The first error occurs while trying to reference the Server property\nof Controller, which no longer exists. The goal of the operation is to get the path to an image file in\nthe app:\n\nThere are two possible solutions to this problem. The first is to keep the functionality as it is. In this\ncase, rather than using Server.MapPath, a fixed path referencing the image files\u2019 location in _wwwroot_\nshould be used. Alternately, since the only purpose of this action method is to return a static image\nfile, the references to this action in view files can be updated to reference the static files directly, which\nimproves runtime performance. Since no processing is being done as part of this action, there\u2019s no\nreason not to just serve the files directly. If it\u2019s not tenable to update all references to this action, the\naction could be rewritten to produce a redirect to the static file\u2019s location.\n\nThe next two errors both occur in the same private method in the same line of code:\n\nBoth this.Url and this.Request cause compiler errors. Looking at how this code is used, its purpose is\nto build a link to the PicController action that renders image files. The same one we just discovered\ncould probably be replaced with direct links to the static files located in _wwwroot_ . For now, it\u2019s worth\ncommenting out this code and adding a TODO: comment to reference the pics another way.\n\n55 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the base Controller class, used by the CatalogController class in which this code\nappears, is still referring to System.Web.Mvc.Controller. There will undoubtedly be more errors to fix\nonce we update this to use ASP.NET Core. First, remove the using System.Web.Mvc; line from the list\nof using statements in CatalogController. Next, add the NuGet package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.\nFinally, add a using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; statement, and build the app again.\n\nThis time, there are 16 errors:\n\n['Include is not a valid named attribute argument (2)', 'HttpStatusCodeResult not found (3)', 'HttpNotFound does not exist (3)', 'SelectList not found (8)']\n\nOnce more, let\u2019s review these errors one by one. First, SelectList can be fixed by adding using\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering;, which eliminates half of the errors.\n\nAll references to return HttpNotFound(); should be replaced with return NotFound();.\n\nAll references to return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest); should be replaced\nwith return BadRequest();.\n\nThat just leaves the use of Include with a [Bind] attribute on a couple of action methods that look like\nthis:\n\nThe preceding code restricts model binding to the properties listed in the Include string. In ASP.NET\nCore MVC, the [Bind] attribute still exists, but no longer needs the Include = argument. Pass the list of\nproperties directly to the [Bind] attribute:\n\nWith these changes, the project compiles once more. It\u2019s generally a better practice to use separate\nmodel types for controller inputs, rather than using model binding directly to your domain model or\ndata model types."}, "Migrate views": "[The two biggest ASP.NET Core MVC features related to views are Razor Pages and Tag Helpers. For](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/razor-pages/)\nthe initial migration, we won\u2019t use either feature. You should, however, keep the features in mind if\nyou continue supporting the app once it\u2019s been migrated. The next step is to copy the _Views_ folder\nfrom the original project into the new one. After building, there are nine errors:\n\n56 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\n['HttpContext does not exist (2)', 'Scripts does not exist (5)', 'Styles does not exist (1)', 'HtmlString could not be found(1)']\n\nInvestigating these errors finds that most of them are in the main *_Layout.cshtml _, with several related_\n_to rendering script and style tags, or displaying when the server hosting the app was last restarted. The_\n_following code listing shows problem areas in the_ _Layout.cshtml* file:\n\nThe reference to Modernizr can be removed. The references to Bootstrap and jQuery can be replaced\nwith CDN links to the appropriate version.\n\nReplace @Styles.Render line with:\n\nReplace the last two Scripts.Render lines with:\n\nFinally, after the Bootstrap <link>, add additional <link> elements for local styles your app uses. For\n_eShop_, the result is shown here:\n\nTo determine the order in which the <link> elements should appear, look at your original app\u2019s\nrendered HTML. Alternatively, review _BundleConfig.cs_, which for the _eShop_ sample includes this code\nindicating the appropriate sequence:\n\n57 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nBuilding again reveals one more error loading jQuery Validation on the _Create_ and _Edit_ views. Replace\nit with this script:\n\nThe last thing to fix in the views is the reference to Session to display how long the app has been\nrunning, and on which machine. We can display this data directly in the site\u2019s *_Layout.cshtml* by\nusing System.Environment.MachineName and\nSystem.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().StartTime:\n\nAt this point, the app once more builds successfully. However, trying to run it just yields _Hello World!_\nbecause the **Empty** ASP.NET Core template is only configured to display that in response to any\nrequest. In the next section, I complete the migration by configuring the app to use ASP.NET Core\nMVC, including dependency injection and configuration. Once that\u2019s in place, the app should run.\nThen it will be time to fix the TODO: tasks that were created earlier.", "Migrate app startup components": {"**Configure MVC**": "The original ASP.NET MVC app has the following code in its Application_Start in _Global.asax_, which\nruns when the app starts up:\n\n58 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nLooking at these lines one by one, the RegisterContainer method sets up dependency injection, which\nwill be ported below. The next three lines configure different parts of MVC: areas, filters, and routes.\nBundles are replaced by static files in the ported app. The last line sets up data access for the app,\nwhich will be shown in a later section.\n\nSince this app isn\u2019t actually using areas, there\u2019s nothing that needs to be done to migrate the area\n[registration call. If your app does need to migrate areas, the docs specify how to configure areas in](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas)\n[ASP.NET Core.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas)\n\nThe call to register global filters invokes a helper on the FilterConfig class in the app\u2019s _App_Start_\nfolder:\n\nThe only attribute added to the app is the ASP.NET MVC filter, HandleErrorAttribute. This filter ensures\nthat when an exception occurs as part of a request, a default action and view are displayed, rather\nthan the exception details. In ASP.NET Core, this same functionality is performed by the\nUseExceptionHandler middleware. The detailed error messages aren\u2019t enabled by default. They must\nbe configured using the UseDeveloperExceptionPage middleware. To configure this behavior to match\nthe original app, the following code must be added to the start of the Configure method in _Startup.cs_ :\n\nThis takes care of the only filter used by the eShop app, and in this case it was done by using built-in\nmiddleware. If you have global filters that must be configured in your app, this is done when MVC is\nadded in _Program.cs_ when you configure services, which is shown later in this chapter.\n\nThe last piece of MVC-related logic that needs to be migrated are the app\u2019s default routes. The call to\nRouteConfig.RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes) passes the MVC route table to the RegisterRoutes\nhelper method, where the following code is executed when the app starts up:\n\n59 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nTaking this code line-by-line, the first line sets up support for attribute routes. This is built into\nASP.NET Core, so it\u2019s unnecessary to configure it separately. Likewise, _{resource}.axd_ files aren\u2019t used\nwith ASP.NET Core, so there\u2019s no need to ignore such routes. The MapRoute method configures the\ndefault for MVC, which uses the typical {controller}/{action}/{id} route template. It also specifies the\ndefaults for this template, such that the CatalogController is the default controller used and the Index\nmethod is the default action. Larger apps will frequently include more calls to MapRoute to set up\nadditional routes.\n\n[ASP.NET Core MVC supports conventional routing and attribute routing. Conventional routing is](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing?preserve-view=true&view=aspnetcore-2.2)\nanalogous to how the route table is configured in the RegisterRoutes method listed previously. To set\nup conventional routing with a default route like the one used in the _eShop_ app, add the following\ncode to the bottom of the Configure method in _Startup.cs_ :\n\nWith these changes in place, the Configure method is almost done. The original template\u2019s app.Run\nmethod that prints _Hello World!_ should be deleted. At this point, the method is as shown here:\n\nNow it\u2019s time to configure MVC services, followed by the rest of the app\u2019s support for dependency\ninjection (DI). So far, the _eShopPorted_ project\u2019s _Program.cs_ file hasn\u2019t added any service configuration.\nNow it\u2019s time to start adding necessary services.\n\nFirst, to get ASP.NET Core MVC to work properly, it needs to be added:\n\n60 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\n```\nbuilder.Services.AddMvc();\n\n```\n\nThe preceding code is the minimal configuration required to get MVC features working. There are\nmany additional features that can be configured from this call (some of which are detailed later in this\nchapter), but for now this will suffice to build the app. Running it now routes the default request\nproperly, but since we\u2019ve not yet configured DI, an error occurs while activating CatalogController,\nbecause no implementation of type ICatalogService has been provided yet. We\u2019ll return to configure\nMVC further in a moment. For now, let\u2019s migrate the app\u2019s dependency injection.\n\n**Migrate dependency injection configuration**\n\nThe original app\u2019s _Global.asax_ file defines the following method, called when the app starts up:\n\n[This code configures an Autofac container, reads a config setting to determine whether real or mock](https://autofac.org/)\ndata should be used, and passes this setting into an Autofac module (found in the app\u2019s _/Modules_\ndirectory). Fortunately, Autofac supports .NET Core, so the module can be migrated directly. Copy the\nfolder into the new project and updates the class\u2019s namespace and it should compile.\n\nASP.NET Core has built-in support for dependency injection, but you can wire up a third-party\ncontainer such as Autofac easily if necessary. In this case, since the app is already configured to use\nAutofac, the simplest solution is to maintain its usage. In _Program.cs_, simply configure the builder to\nuse the AutofacServiceProviderFactory as shown:\n\nFor now, the setting for useMockData is set to true. This setting will be read from configuration in a\nmoment. At this point, the app compiles and should load successfully when run, as shown in Figure 412.\n\n61 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\n_Figure 4-12. Ported eShop app running locally with mock data._\n\n**Migrate app settings**\n\n[ASP.NET Core uses a new configuration system, which by default uses an](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?preserve-view=true&view=aspnetcore-2.2) _appsettings.json_ file. By using\nCreateDefaultBuilder in _Program.cs_, the default configuration is already set up in the app. To access\nconfiguration, classes just need to request it in their constructor. In _Program.cs_, configuration is\naccessible from builder.Configuration.\n\nThe original app referenced its settings using ConfigurationManager.AppSettings. A quick search for\nall references of this term yields the set of settings the new app needs. There are only two:\n\n['UseMockData', 'UseCustomizationData']\n\nIf your app has more complex configuration, especially if it\u2019s using custom configuration sections,\nyou\u2019ll probably want to create and bind objects to different parts of your app\u2019s configuration. These\n[types can then be accessed using the options pattern. However, as noted in the referenced doc, this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/options)\npattern shouldn\u2019t be used in _Program.cs_ (or Startup.ConfigureServices). Instead the ported app will\nreference the UseMockData configuration value directly.\n\nFirst, modify the ported app\u2019s appsettings.json file and add the two settings in the root:\n\n62 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nNow, modify _Program.cs_ to access the UseMockData setting from the builder.Configuration property\n(where previously we set the value to true):\n\n```\nbool useMockData = builder.Configuration.GetValue<bool>(\"UseMockData\");\n\n```\n\nAt this point, the setting is pulled from configuration. The other setting, UseCustomizationData, is\nused by the CatalogDBInitializer class. When you first ported this class, you commented out the access\nto ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"UseCustomizationData\"]. Now it\u2019s time to modify it to use\nASP.NET Core configuration. Modify the constructor of CatalogDBInitializer as follows:\n\nAll access to configuration within the web app should be modified in this manner to use the new\nIConfiguration type. Dependencies that require access to .NET Framework configuration can include\nsuch settings in an _app.config_ file added to the web project. The dependent projects can work with\nConfigurationManager to access settings, and shouldn\u2019t require any changes if they already use this\napproach. However, since ASP.NET Core apps run as their own executable, they don\u2019t reference\n_web.config_ but rather _app.config_ . By migrating settings from the legacy app\u2019s _web.config_ file to a new\n_app.config_ file in the ASP.NET Core app, components that use ConfigurationManager to access their\nsettings will continue to function properly.\n\nThe app\u2019s migration is nearly complete. The only remaining task is data access configuration."}, "Data access considerations": {"**Migrate to Entity Framework Core**": "Assuming a decision is made to migrate to EF Core, the steps can be fairly straightforward, especially\n[if the original app used a code-based model approach. When preparing to port from EF 6 to EF Core,](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/efcore-and-ef6/porting/)\nreview the availability of features in the destination version of EF Core you\u2019ll be using.

Then adjust how the connection string is passed to the DbContext type and how\nthey\u2019re wired up for dependency injection.\n\nEF Core is added as a package reference to the project:\n\n```\n< PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore\" Version=\"2.2.6\" />\n\n```\n\nThe reference to EF 6 is removed:\n\n```\n< PackageReference Include=\"EntityFramework\" Version=\"6.2.0\" />\n\n```\n\nThe compiler will report errors in CatalogDBContext and CatalogDBInitializer. CatalogDbContext\nneeds to have the old namespaces removed and replaced with Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore. Its\nconstructors can be removed. DbModelBuilder should be replaced with ModelBuilder. The helper\nmethods for configuring types are moved to separate classes implementing\nIEntityTypeConfiguration<T>. Then the CatalogDBContext class\u2019s OnModelCreating method simply\nbecomes:\n\nOther changes involved include:\n\n['HasDatabaseGeneratedOption(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None) replaced with\\nValueGeneratedNever()', 'HasRequired<T> replaced with HasOne<T>', 'Installed Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational package', 'Add a constructor to CatalogDBContext taking DbContextOptions and passing it to the base\\nconstructor']\n\nAn example configuration class for CatalogType is shown here:\n\n65 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nThe CatalogDBInitializer and its base class, CreateDatabaseIfNotExists<T>, are incompatible with EF\n[Core.

Along\nwith other entity properties, seed data can be configured in IEntityTypeConfiguration classes by using\nbuilder.HasData(). The original app loaded seed data from CSV files in the _Setup_ directory. Given that\nthere are only a handful of items, these data records can instead be added as part of the entity\nconfiguration. This approach works well for lookup data in tables that change infrequently. Adding the\nfollowing to CatalogTypeConfig\u2019s Configure method ensures the associated rows are present when\nthe database is created:\n\nThe initial app includes a PreconfiguredData class, which includes data for CatalogBrand and\nCatalogType, so using this method the HasData call reduces to:\n\nThe CatalogItem data can also be pulled from PreconfiguredData, and assuming the associated\nimages are kept in source control, that is the last table needed for the app to function. The\nCatalogDBInitializer class can be removed, along with any references to it. The\nCatalogItemHiLoGenerator class and the SQL files in the Infrastructure directory are also removed,\nalong with any references to them (in CatalogService, ApplicationModule).\n\nWith the elimination of the special key generator classes for CatalogItem, this code now is removed\nfrom CatalogItemConfig:\n\nWith these modifications, the ASP.NET Core app builds, but it doesn\u2019t yet work with EF Core, which\nmust still be configured for dependency injection.

The seed data\nadded through HasData is only inserted when migrations are applied. The source app didn\u2019t use\nmigrations, and if it had, they wouldn\u2019t migrate as-is. The best approach is to start with a new\nmigration script. To do this, add a package reference for Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design and\nopen a terminal window in the project root. Then run:\n\n```\ndotnet ef migrations add Initial\n\n```\n\nDrop the existing _eShopPorted_ database if it exists, then run:\n\n```\ndotnet ef database update\n\n```\n\nThis creates and seeds the database.

Adding a custom formatter to output\nresponses in a specific way involves inheriting from an appropriate base class and adding the\nformatter to MVC in _Program.cs_ :\n\n[You\u2019ll find a complete list of base classes in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.formatters) namespace.\n\nThe steps to migrate from a Web API formatter to an ASP.NET Core MVC formatter are:\n\n['Identify an appropriate base class for the new formatter.', 'Create a new instance of the base class and implement its required methods.', 'Copy over the functionality from the Web API formatter to the new implementation.', 'Configure MVC in the ASP.NET Core App\u2019s ConfigureServices method to use the new\\nformatter.']", "**Custom filters**": "Filters are used in ASP.NET Core apps to execute code before and/or after certain stages in the\nrequest processing pipeline.

This interface provides methods for before (OnActionExecuting) and after](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.web.mvc.iactionfilter)\n(OnActionExecuted) which can be used to execute code before and/or after an action executes, as\nnoted for each method.\n\nASP.NET Core continues to support filters, and its unification of MVC and Web API means there is only\n[one approach to their implementation. The docs include detailed coverage of the five (5) kinds of](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters#filter-types)\n[filters built into ASP.NET Core MVC. All of the filter variants supported in ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters#filter-types)\n\n73 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nWeb API have associated versions in ASP.NET Core, so migration is generally just a matter of\nidentifying the appropriate interface and/or base class and migrating the code over.\n\nIn addition to the synchronous interfaces, ASP.NET Core also provides async interfaces like\nIAsyncActionFilter which provide a single async method that can be used to incorporate code to run\nboth before and after the action, as shown:\n\nWhen migrating async code (or code that should be async), teams should consider leveraging the\nbuilt in async types that are provided for this purpose.\n\nMost ASP.NET MVC and Web API apps do not use a large number of custom filters. Since the\napproach to filters in ASP.NET Core MVC is closely aligned with filters in ASP.NET MVC and Web API,\nthe migration of custom filters is generally fairly straightforward. Be sure to read the detailed\ndocumentation on filters in ASP.NET Core\u2019s docs, and once you\u2019re sure you have a good\nunderstanding of them, port the logic from the old system to the new system\u2019s filters.", "**Route constraints**": "ASP.NET Core uses route constraints to help ensure requests are routed properly to route a request.\n[ASP.NET Core supports a large number of different route constraints for this purpose. Route](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing#route-constraint-reference)\nconstraints can be applied in the route table, but most apps built with ASP.NET MVC 5 and/or\n[ASP.NET Web API 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/web-api/overview/web-api-routing-and-actions/attribute-routing-in-web-api-2#route-constraints) use inline route constraints applied to attribute routes. Inline route constraints use\na format like this one:\n\n```\n[Route(\"/customer/{id:int}\")]\n\n```\n\nThe :int after the id route parameter constrains the value to match the int type. One benefit of using\nroute constraints is that they allow for two otherwise-identical routes to exist where the parameters\n[differ only by their type. This allows for the equivalent of method overloading](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/member-overloading) of routes based solely\non parameter type.\n\nThe set of route constraints, their syntax, and usage is very similar between all three approaches.\nCustom route constraints are fairly rare in customer applications. If your app uses a custom route\n[constraint and needs to port to ASP.NET Core, the docs include examples showing how to create](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing#custom-route-constraints)\n[custom route constraints in ASP.NET Core. Essentially all that\u2019s required is to implement](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing#custom-route-constraints)\nIRouteConstraint and its Match method, and then add the custom constraint when configuring\nrouting for the app:\n\n74 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nThis is very similar to how custom constraints are used in ASP.NET Web API, which uses\nIHttpRouteConstraint and configures it using a resolver and a call to\nHttpConfiguration.MapHttpAttributeRoutes:\n\nASP.NET MVC 5 follows a very similar approach, using IRouteConstraint for its interface name and\nconfiguring the constraint as part of route configuration:\n\nMigrating route constraint usage as well as custom route constraints to ASP.NET Core is typically very\nstraightforward.", "**Custom route handlers**": "Another fairly advanced feature of ASP.NET MVC 5 is route handlers. Custom route handlers\nimplement IRouteHandler, which includes a single method that returns an IHttpHandler for a give\nrequest. The IHttpHandler, in turn, exposes an IsReusable property and a single ProcessRequest\nmethod. In ASP.NET MVC 5, you can configure a particular route in the route table to use your custom\nhandler:\n\n75 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nTo migrate custom route handlers from ASP.NET MVC 5 to ASP.NET Core, you can either use a filter\n[(such as an action filter) or a custom IRouter. The filter approach is relatively straightforward, and can](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.routing.irouter)\nbe added as a global filter when MVC is added to the app\u2019s services during startup:\n\nThe IRouter option requires implementing the interface\u2019s RouteAsync and GetVirtualPath methods.\nThe custom router is added to the request pipeline during app startup.\n\n[In ASP.NET Web API, these handlers are referred to as custom message handlers, rather than](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/web-api/overview/advanced/http-message-handlers#custom-message-handlers) _route_\n_handlers_ . Message handlers must derive from DelegatingHandler and override its SendAsync method.\nMessage handlers can be chained together to form a pipeline in a fashion that is very similar to\nASP.NET Core middleware and its request pipeline.\n\nASP.NET Core has no DelegatingHandler type or separate message handler pipeline. Instead, such\nhandlers should be migrated using global filters, custom IRouter instances (see above), or custom\nmiddleware. ASP.NET Core MVC filters and IRouter types have the advantage of having built-in access\nto MVC constructs like controllers and actions, while middleware is a lower level approach that has no\nties to MVC. This makes it more flexible but also requires more effort if you need to access MVC\ncomponents.", "**CORS support**": "CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a W3C standard that allows servers to accept requests that\ndon\u2019t originate from responses they\u2019ve served. ASP.NET MVC 5 and ASP.NET Web API 2 support CORS\nin different ways. The simplest way to enable CORS support in ASP.NET MVC 5 is with an action filter\nlike this one:\n\n[ASP.NET Web API can also use such a filter, but it has built-in support for enabling CORS](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/enabling-cross-origin-requests-in-web-api#enable-cors) as well:\n\n76 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nOnce this is added, you can configure allowed origins, headers, and methods using the EnableCors\nattribute, like so:\n\nBefore migrating your CORS implementation from ASP.NET MVC 5 or ASP.NET Web API 2, be sure to\n[review how CORS works](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/enabling-cross-origin-requests-in-web-api#how-cors-works) and create some automated tests that demonstrate CORS is working as\nexpected in your current system.\n\nIn ASP.NET Core, there are three built-in ways to enable CORS:\n\n['[Configured via policy in ConfigureServices](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/cors?#cors-with-named-policy-and-middleware)', '[Enabled with endpoint routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/cors?#enable-cors-with-endpoint-routing)', '[Enabled with the EnableCors attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/cors#enable-cors-with-attributes)']\n\nEach of these approaches is covered in detail in the docs, which are linked from the above options.\nWhich one you choose will largely depend on how your existing app supports CORS. If the app uses\nattributes, you can probably migrate to use the EnableCors attribute most easily. If your app uses\nfilters, you could continue using that approach (though it\u2019s not the typical approach used in ASP.NET\nCore), or migrate to use attributes or policies. Endpoint routing is a relatively new feature introduced\nwith ASP.NET Core 3 and as such it doesn\u2019t have a close analog in ASP.NET MVC 5 or ASP.NET Web\nAPI 2 apps.", "**Custom areas**": "Many ASP.NET MVC apps use Areas to organize the project. Areas typically reside in the root of the\nproject in an _Areas_ folder, and must be registered when the application starts, typically in\nApplication_Start():\n\n```\nAreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();\n\n```\n\nAn alternative to registering all areas in startup is to use the RouteArea attribute on individual\ncontrollers:\n\nASP.NET Web API apps don\u2019t typically use areas explicitly, since their controllers can be placed in any\nfolder in the project. Teams can use any folder structure they like to organize their API controllers.\n\n77 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\n[Areas](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas) are supported in ASP.NET Core MVC. The approach used is nearly identical to the use of areas\nin ASP.NET MVC 5. Developers migrating code using areas should keep in mind the following\ndifferences:\n\n['AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas is not used in ASP.NET Core MVC', 'Areas are applied using the [Area(\"name\")] attribute (not RouteArea as in ASP.NET MVC 5)', 'Areas can be added to the route table templates, if desired (or they can use attribute routing)']\n\nTo add area support to the route table in ASP.NET Core MVC, you would add the following during app\nstartup:\n\nAreas can also be used with attribute routing, using the {area} keyword in the route definition (it\u2019s one\n[of several reserved routing names that can be used with route templates).](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing#reserved-routing-names)\n\nTag helpers support areas with the asp-area attribute, which can be used to generate links in Razor\nviews and pages:\n\nIf you\u2019re migrating to Razor Pages you will need to use an _Areas_ folder in your _Pages_ folder. For more\n[information, see Areas with Razor Pages.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas#areas-with-razor-pages)\n\n[In addition to the above guidance, teams should review how routing in ASP.NET Core works with](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing#areas)\n[areas](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing#areas) as part of their migration planning process.", "**Integration tests for ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API**": "Integration tests are automated tests that verify several different parts of an app work together\ncorrectly. Writing integration tests for ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API usually involved deploying\n\n78 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nthe app to a real web server, such as a local instance of IIS or IIS Express, and then making requests to\nthis hosted application using an HTTP client. Some of these tests may interact with the client-side user\n[interface using browser automation tools like Selenium, though often these are referred to as](https://www.selenium.dev/) _UI tests_\nrather than integration tests.\n\nIf your migrated app shares the same behavior as its original version, whatever existing technology\nthe team is using to perform integration tests (and UI tests) should continue to work just as it did\nbefore. These tests are usually indifferent to the underlying technology used to host the app they\u2019re\ntesting, and interact with it only through HTTP requests. Where things may get more challenging is\nwith how the tests interact with the app to get it into a known good state prior to each test. This may\nrequire some migration effort, since configuration and startup are significantly different in ASP.NET\nCore compared to ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Web API.\n\n[Teams should strongly consider migrating their integration tests to use ASP.NET Core\u2019s built-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests)\n[integration testing](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests) support. In ASP.NET Core, apps can be tested by deploying them to a TestHost,\nwhich is configured using a WebApplicationFactory. There\u2019s a little bit of setup required to host the\napp for testing, but once this is in place, creating individual integration tests is very straightforward.\n\nOne of the best features of ASP.NET Core\u2019s integration testing support is that the app is hosted in\nmemory. There\u2019s no need to configure a real webserver to host the app. There\u2019s no need to use a\nbrowser automation tool (if you\u2019re only testing ASP.NET Core and not client-side behavior). Many of\nthe problems that can be encountered when trying to use a real web server for automated integration\ntests, such as firewall issues or process start/stop issues, are eliminated with this approach. Since the\nrequests are all made in memory with no network requirement, the tests also tend to run much faster\nthan tests that must set up a separate webserver and communicate with it over the network (even if\nit\u2019s running on the same machine).\n\nBelow you can see an example ASP.NET Core integration test (sometimes referred to as _functional_\n_tests_ [to distinguish them from lower-level integration tests) from the eShopOnWeb reference](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb)\n[application:](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb)\n\n79 CHAPTER 4 | Example migration of eShop to ASP.NET Core\n\nIf the app being migrated has no integration tests, the migration process can be a great opportunity\nto add some. These tests can verify that the migrated app behaves as the team expects. When such\ntests are in place early in a migration, they can ensure that later migration efforts do not break\npreviously migrated portions of the app. Given how easy it is to set up and run integration tests in\nASP.NET Core, the return on the investment spent setting up such tests is usually pretty high.", "**WCF client configuration**": "If your app currently relies on WCF services as a client, this scenario is supported. However, you will\n[need to migrate your configuration from](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/configuration) _web.config_ to use the new _appsettings.json_ file.

The app is a\nmix of MVC views and API endpoints. The MVC routes include many different paths based on\nfunctionality and all start from the root of the app using the standard /{controller}/{action}/{id?} route\ntemplate. The API endpoints follow a similar pattern, but are all under an /api root.\n\nAssuming the task of porting the app is split such that either the MVC functionality or the API\nfunctionality is migrated to ASP.NET Core first, how would the original site continue to function\nseamlessly with the new ASP.NET Core app running somewhere else? Users of the system should\ncontinue to see the same URLs they did prior to the migration, unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary to\nchange them.\n\n[Fortunately, IIS is a feature-rich web server, and two features it has are URL Rewrite module and](https://docs.microsoft.com/iis/extensions/url-rewrite-module/url-rewrite-module-video-walkthrough)\n[Application Request Routing. Using these features, IIS can act as a reverse proxy, routing client](https://docs.microsoft.com/iis/extensions/planning-for-arr/application-request-routing-version-2-overview)\nrequests to the appropriate back-end web app. To configure IIS as a reverse proxy, check the **Enable**\n**proxy** checkbox in the Application Request Routing feature, then add a URL Rewrite rule like this one:\n\nAs a reverse proxy, IIS can route traffic matching certain patterns to entirely separate apps, potentially\non different servers.\n\n81 CHAPTER 5 | Deployment scenarios when migrating to ASP.NET Core\n\nUsing just the URL Rewrite module (perhaps combined with host headers), IIS can easily support\nmultiple web sites, each potentially running different versions of .NET. A large web app might be\ndeployed as a collection of individual sites, each responding to different IP addresses and/or host\nheaders, or as a single web site with one or more sub-applications in it responding to certain URL\npaths (which doesn\u2019t even require URL Rewrite).\n\nThere are pros and cons to using the same or different subdomains (and domains) to host a single\n[app. Features like cookies and intra-app communication using mechanisms like CORS may require](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/cors)\nmore configuration to work properly in distributed apps. However, apps that use different\nsubdomains can more easily use DNS to route requests to entirely different network destinations, and\nso can more easily be deployed to many different servers (virtual or otherwise) without the need for\nIIS to act as a reverse proxy.\n\nIn the example described above, assume the API endpoints are designated as the first part of the app\nto be ported to ASP.NET Core. In this case, a new ASP.NET Core app is created and hosted in IIS as a\nseparate web _application_ within the existing ASP.NET MVC web _site_ . Since it will be added as a child of\nthe original web site and will be named _api_, its default route should no longer begin with api/.\nKeeping this would result in it matching URLs of the form /api/api/endpoint.\n\nFigure 5-1 shows how the ASP.NET Core 2.1 _api_ app appears in IIS Manager as a part of the existing\n_DotNetMvcApp_ site.\n\n82 CHAPTER 5 | Deployment scenarios when migrating to ASP.NET Core\n\n_Figure 5-1. .NET Framework Site with .NET Core app in IIS._\n\nThe _DotNetMvcApp_ site is hosted as an MVC 5 app running on .NET Framework 4.7.2. It has its own IIS\napp pool configured in integrated mode and running .NET CLR version 4.0.30319. The _api_ app is an\nASP.NET Core app running on .NET Framework 4.6.1 (net461). It was added to the _DotNetMvcApp_ as a\nnew IIS app and configured to use its own Application Pool. Its Application Pool is also running in\nintegrated mode but is configured with a .NET CLR version of **No Managed Code** since it will be\n[executed using the ASP.NET Core Module. The version of the ASP.NET Core app is just an example. It](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module)\ncould also be configured to run on NET 5+. Though at that point, it would no longer be able to target\n.NET Framework libraries (see Choose the Right .NET Core Version)\n\nConfigured in this manner, the only change that must be made in order for the ASP.NET Core app\u2019s\nAPIs to be routed properly is to change its default route template from [Route(\"[api/controller]\")] to\n\n[Route(\"[controller]\")].\n\nAlternately the ASP.NET Core app can be another top-level web site in IIS. In this case, you can\n[configure the original site to use a rewrite rule (with URL Rewrite) that will redirect to the other app if](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite)\nthe path starts with /api. The ASP.NET Core app can use a different host header for its route so that it\ndoesn\u2019t conflict with the main app but can still respond to requests using root-based routes.\n\nAs an example, the same ASP.NET Core app used in Figure 5-1 can be deployed to another folder\nconfigured as an IIS web site. The site should use an app pool configured just as before, with **No**\n\n83 CHAPTER 5 | Deployment scenarios when migrating to ASP.NET Core\n\n**Managed Code** . Configure its bindings to respond to a unique host name on the server, such as\napi.contoso.com. To configure URL Rewrite to rewrite requests matching /api just add a new inbound\nrule at the IIS server (or individual site) level. Match the pattern ^/api(.*) and specify an Action type of\nRewrite and a Rewrite URL of api.contoso.com/{R:1}. The combination of using (.*) in the matching\npattern and {R:1} in the rewrite URL will ensure the rest of the path gets used with the new URL. With\nthis in place, separate sites on the same IIS server can coexist running separate versions of .NET, but\nthey can be made to appear to the Internet as one web app. Figure 5-2 shows the rewrite rule as\nconfigured in IIS with the separate web site.\n\n_Figure 5-2.

There are differences between\n.NET Core versions and their capabilities and compatibilities with .NET Framework, and you learned\nhow to choose the right version of .NET Core for your app.\n\nPorting a large app often entails a fair amount of risk and effort. You learned how to mitigate this risk\nby employing one or more incremental migration strategies along with several deployment strategies\nfor keeping partially migrated apps running in production.\n\nThere are many architectural differences between ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core.
