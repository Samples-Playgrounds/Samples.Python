This guide introduces the basic concepts of building a development lifecycle around Azure using .NET tools and processes. After finishing this guide, you'll reap the benefits of a mature DevOps toolchain. # Who this guide is for ![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg) You should be an experienced ASP.NET Core developer (200-300 level). You don't need to know anything about Azure, as we'll cover that in this introduction. This guide may also be useful for DevOps engineers who are more focused on operations than development. This guide targets Windows developers. However, Linux and macOS are fully supported by .NET Core. To adapt this guide for Linux/macOS, watch for callouts for Linux/macOS differences. # What this guide doesn't cover This guide is focused on an end-to-end continuous deployment experience for .NET developers. It's not an exhaustive guide to all things Azure, and it doesn't focus extensively on .NET APIs for Azure services. The emphasis is all around continuous integration, deployment, monitoring, and debugging. Near the end of the guide, recommendations for next steps are offered. Included in the suggestions are Azure platform services that are useful to ASP.NET Core developers. # What's in this guide #### **[Tools and downloads](xref:azure/devops/tools-and-downloads)** Learn where to acquire the tools used in this guide. #### **[Deploy to App Service](xref:azure/devops/deploy-to-app-service)** Learn the various methods for deploying an ASP.NET Core app to Azure App Service. #### **[Continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps](xref:azure/devops/cicd)** Build an end-to-end continuous integration and deployment solution for your ASP.NET Core app with GitHub, Azure DevOps Services, and Azure. #### **[Continuous integration and deployment with GitHub Actions](xref:azure/devops/github-actions)** Build an end-to-end continuous integration and deployment solution for your ASP.NET Core app with GitHub, GitHub Actions, and Azure, including code", "scanning for security and quality using CodeQL. #### **[Monitor and debug](xref:azure/devops/monitor)** Use Azure's tools to monitor, troubleshoot, and tune your application. #### **[Next steps](xref:azure/devops/next-steps)** Other learning paths for the ASP.NET Core developer learning Azure. # Additional introductory reading If this is your first exposure to cloud computing, these articles explain the basics. -

This guide takes a minimalist approach and uses the Azure Cloud Shell whenever possible to reduce the steps required. However, the Azure portal must be used for some portions. # <span id=\"page-7-1\"></span>Prerequisites The following subscriptions are required: - Azure If you don't have an account, [get a free trial.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) - Azure DevOps Services your Azure DevOps subscription and organization is created in Chapter 4. - GitHub If you don't have an account, [sign up for free.](https://github.com/join) The following tools are required: - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) A fundamental understanding of Git is recommended for this guide. Review the [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) [documentation,](https://git-scm.com/doc) specifically [git remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote) and [git push.](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) - [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/) Version 2.1.300 or later is required to build and run the sample app. If Visual Studio is installed with the **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload, the .NET Core SDK is already installed. Verify your .NET Core SDK installation. Open a command shell, and run the following command: :::{custom-style=CodeBox} dotnetcli dotnet --version ::: # <span id=\"page-7-2\"></span>Recommended tools (Windows only) \u2022 [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)'s robust Azure tools provide a GUI for most of the functionality described in this guide. Any edition of Visual Studio will work, including the free Visual Studio Community Edition. The tutorials are written to demonstrate development, deployment, and DevOps both with and without Visual Studio. Confirm that Visual Studio has the following [workloads](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio) installed: - ASP.NET and web development - Azure development \u2013 .NET Core cross-platform development # <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>Deploy an", "app to App Service [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/) is Azure's web hosting platform. Deploying a web app to Azure App Service can be done manually or by an automated process. This section of the guide discusses deployment methods that can be triggered manually or by script using the command line, or triggered manually using Visual Studio. In this section, you'll accomplish the following tasks: [!div class=\"checklist\"] - Download and build the sample app. - Create an Azure App Service Web App using the Azure Cloud Shell. - Deploy the sample app to Azure using Git. - Deploy a change to the app using Visual Studio. - Add a staging slot to the web app. - Deploy an update to the staging slot. - <span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>\u2022 Swap the staging and production slots. # Download and test the app The app used in this guide is a pre-built ASP.NET Core app, [Simple Feed Reader](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/simple-feed-reader/). It's an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app that uses the Microsoft.SyndicationFeed.ReaderWriter API to retrieve an RSS/Atom feed and display the news items in a list. Feel free to review the code, but it's important to understand that there's nothing special about this app. It's just a simple ASP.NET Core app for illustrative purposes. From a command shell, download the code, build the project, and run it as follows. #### **Note** Linux and macOS users should make appropriate changes for paths, for example, using forward slash (/) rather than back slash (\\).\\* 1. Clone the code to a folder on your local machine. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console git clone https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/simplefeed-reader/ ::: 2. Change your working folder to the *simple-feed-reader* folder that was created. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console cd .\\simple-feed-reader\\SimpleFeedReader ::: 3. Restore the packages, and build the solution. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} dotnetcli dotnet build ::: 4. Run the app. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} dotnetcli dotnet run ::: 5. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. The app allows you to type or paste a syndication feed URL and view a list of news items. ![](_page_10_Picture_9.jpeg) 6. Once you're satisfied the app is working correctly, shut it down by pressing Ctrl+C in the command shell. # <span id=\"page-11-0\"></span>Create the Azure App Service Web App To deploy the app, you'll need to create an App Service [Web App.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-web-overview) After creation of the Web App, you'll deploy to it from your local machine using Git. - 1. Sign in to the [Azure Cloud Shell.](https://shell.azure.com/bash) Note: When you sign in for the first time, Cloud Shell prompts to create a storage account for configuration files. Accept the defaults or provide a unique name. - 2. Use the Cloud Shell for the following steps. - a. Declare a variable to store your web app's name. The name must be unique to be used in the default URL. Using the \\$RANDOM Bash function to construct the name guarantees uniqueness and results in the format webappname99999. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console webappname=mywebapp\\$RANDOM ::: - b. Create a resource group. Resource groups provide a means to aggregate Azure resources to be managed as a group. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az", "group create --location centralus --name AzureTutorial ::: The az command invokes the [Azure CLI.](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/) The CLI can be run locally, but using it in the Cloud Shell saves time and configuration. c. Create an App Service plan in the S1 tier. An App Service plan is a grouping of web apps that share the same pricing tier. The S1 tier isn't free, but it's required for the staging slots feature. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az appservice plan create --name \\$webappname - resource-group AzureTutorial --sku S1 ::: - d. Create the web app resource using the App Service plan in the same resource group. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az webapp create --name \\$webappname --resourcegroup AzureTutorial --plan \\$webappname ::: - e. Set the deployment branch to main in the appsettings configuration. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az webapp config appsettings set --name \\$webappname -resource-group AzureTutorial --settings DEPLOYMENT\\_BRANCH=main ::: - f. Set the deployment credentials. These deployment credentials apply to all the web apps in your subscription. Don't use special characters in the user name. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az webapp deployment user set --user-name REPLACE\\_WITH\\_USER\\_NAME --password REPLACE\\_WITH\\_PASSWORD ::: g. Configure the web app to accept deployments from local Git and display the *Git deployment URL*. **Note this URL for reference later**. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli echo Git deployment URL: \\$(az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name \\$webappname --resource-group AzureTutorial --query url - output tsv) ::: h. Display the *web app URL*. Browse to this URL to see the blank web app. **Note this URL for reference later**. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console echo Web app URL: http://\\$webappname.azurewebsites.net ::: - 3. Using a command shell on your local machine, navigate to the web app's project folder (for example, \\*.-feed-reader). Execute the following commands to set up Git to push to the deployment URL: - a. Add the remote URL to the local repository. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console git remote add azure-prod GIT\\_DEPLOYMENT\\_URL ::: b. Push the local default branch (*main*) to the *azure-prod* remote's deployment branch (*main*). :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console git push azure-prod main ::: You'll be prompted for the deployment credentials you created earlier. Observe the output in the command shell. Azure builds the ASP.NET Core app remotely. 4. In a browser, navigate to the *Web app URL* and note the app has been built and deployed. Additional changes can be committed to the local Git repository with git commit. These changes are pushed to Azure with the preceding git push command. # <span id=\"page-12-0\"></span>Deployment with Visual Studio #### **Note** This section applies to Windows only. Linux and macOS users should make the change described in step 2 below. Save the file, and commit the change to the local repository with git commit. Finally, push the change with git push, as in the first section.\\* The app has already been deployed from the command shell. Let's use Visual Studio's integrated tools to deploy an update to the app. Behind the scenes, Visual Studio accomplishes the same thing as the command line tooling, but within Visual Studio's familiar UI. - 1. Open *SimpleFeedReader.sln* in Visual Studio. - 2.", "In Solution Explorer, open *Pages.cshtml*. Change <h2>Simple Feed Reader</h2> to <h2>Simple Feed Reader - V2</h2>. - 3. Press Ctrl+Shift+B to build the app. - 4. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and click **Publish**. ![](_page_13_Picture_0.jpeg) - 5. Visual Studio can create a new App Service resource, but this update will be published over the existing deployment. In the **Pick a publish target** dialog, select **App Service** from the list on the left, and then select **Select Existing**. Click **Publish**. - 6. In the **App Service** dialog, confirm that the Microsoft or Organizational account used to create your Azure subscription is displayed in the upper right. If it's not, click the drop-down and add it. - 7. Confirm that the correct Azure **Subscription** is selected. For **View**, select **Resource Group**. Expand the **AzureTutorial** resource group and then select the existing web app. Click **OK**. ![](_page_13_Picture_4.jpeg) Visual Studio builds and deploys the app to Azure. Browse to the web app URL. Validate that the <h2> element modification is live. ![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg) # <span id=\"page-14-0\"></span>Deployment slots Deployment slots support the staging of changes without impacting the app running in production. Once the staged version of the app is validated by a quality assurance team, the production and staging slots can be swapped. The app in staging is promoted to production in this manner. The following steps create a staging slot, deploy some changes to it, and swap the staging slot with production after verification. - 1. Sign in to the [Azure Cloud Shell,](https://shell.azure.com/bash) if not already signed in. - 2. Create the staging slot. - a. Create a deployment slot with the name *staging*. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az webapp deployment slot create --name \\$webappname --resource-group AzureTutorial --slot staging ::: - b. Set the deployment branch to main in the appsettings configuration. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az webapp config appsettings set --name \\$webappname -resource-group AzureTutorial --slot staging --settings DEPLOYMENT\\_BRANCH=main ::: - c. Configure the staging slot to use deployment from local Git and get the **staging** deployment URL. **Note this URL for reference later**. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli echo Git deployment URL for staging: \\$(az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name \\$webappname --resource-group AzureTutorial - slot staging --query url --output tsv) ::: - d. Display the staging slot's URL. Browse to the URL to see the empty staging slot. **Note this URL for reference later**. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console echo Staging web app URL: http://\\$webappnamestaging.azurewebsites.net ::: - 3. In a text editor or Visual Studio, modify *Pages/Index.cshtml* again so that the <h2> element reads <h2>Simple Feed Reader - V3</h2> and save the file. - 4. Commit the file to the local Git repository, using either the **Changes** page in Visual Studio's *Team Explorer* tab, or by entering the following using the local machine's command shell: - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console git commit -a -m \"upgraded to V3\" ::: - 5. Using the local machine's command shell, add the staging deployment URL as a Git remote and push the committed changes: - a. Add the remote URL for staging to the", "local Git repository. - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console git remote add azure-staging <Git\\_staging\\_deployment\\_URL> ::: - b. Push the local default branch (*main*) to the *azure-staging* remote's deployment branch (*main*). - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} console git push azure-staging main ::: - Wait while Azure builds and deploys the app. - 6. To verify that V3 has been deployed to the staging slot, open two browser windows. In one window, navigate to the original web app URL. In the other window, navigate to the staging web app URL. The production URL serves V2 of the app. The staging URL serves V3 of the app. ![](_page_15_Picture_11.jpeg) 7. In the Cloud Shell, swap the verified/warmed-up staging slot into production. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az webapp deployment slot swap --name \\$webappname - -resource-group AzureTutorial --slot staging ::: 8. Verify that the swap occurred by refreshing the two browser windows. ![](_page_16_Picture_2.jpeg) # <span id=\"page-16-0\"></span>Summary In this section, the following tasks were completed: - Downloaded and built the sample app. - Created an Azure App Service Web App using the Azure Cloud Shell. - Deployed the sample app to Azure using Git. - Deployed a change to the app using Visual Studio. - Added a staging slot to the web app. - Deployed an update to the staging slot. - Swapped the staging and production slots. In the next section, you'll learn how to build a DevOps pipeline with Azure Pipelines. # <span id=\"page-16-1\"></span>Additional reading - [Web Apps overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-web-overview) - [Build a .NET Core and SQL Database web app in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/tutorial-dotnetcore-sqldb-app) - [Configure deployment credentials for Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-deployment-credentials) - [Set up staging environments in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-staged-publishing) # <span id=\"page-17-0\"></span>Continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps #### **Note** This section details continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps. You can achieve that with GitHub Actions as well. GitHub Actions is a workflow engine built into GitHub that can also be used for continuous integration and deployment. To follow the guide for building and deploying to Azure using GitHub, complete the **Publish the app's code to GitHub** and **Disconnect local Git deployment** sections below and then proceed to the GitHub Actions section. In the previous chapter, you created a local Git repository for the Simple Feed Reader app. In this chapter, you'll publish that code to a GitHub repository and construct an Azure DevOps Services pipeline using Azure Pipelines. The pipeline enables continuous builds and deployments of the app. Any commit to the GitHub repository triggers a build and a deployment to the Azure Web App's staging slot. In this section, you'll complete the following tasks: [!div class=\"checklist\"] - Publish the app's code to GitHub - Disconnect local Git deployment - Create an Azure DevOps organization - Create a team project in Azure DevOps organization - Configure a self-hosted agent if necessary - Create a build definition - Create a release pipeline - Commit changes to GitHub and automatically deploy to Azure - Examine the Azure Pipelines pipeline # <span id=\"page-18-0\"></span>Publish the app's code to GitHub - 1.

You'll also learn how to select the correct platform for your CI/CD needs. # <span id=\"page-55-1\"></span>Continuous integration and deployment with GitHub Actions GitHub has long been the home for millions of open-source developers around the globe. Most developers associate source control with GitHub. However, GitHub is an evolving platform that can be used for more than just synchronizing Git repositories. #### <span id=\"page-55-2\"></span>**GitHub Actions** GitHub Actions is a workflow engine that can automate workflows for nearly all events that occur on GitHub. Actions is a great solution for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. In this section of articles, you'll learn how to create an Actions workflow. The workflow will build, test, and deploy a .NET web app to Azure Web Apps. #### **Note** Before you begin, complete the **Publish the app's code to GitHub** and **Disconnect local Git deployment** sections of the Continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps section to publish your code to GitHub. Then proceed to the Build", "article. In the Build article, you'll create the initial workflow to build and test the .NET app. You'll: [!div class=\"checklist\"] - Learn the basic structure of a GitHub Action workflow YAML file. - Use a template to create a basic build workflow that builds a .NET app and executes unit tests. - Publish the compiled app so that it's ready for deployment.

You'll also learn how to select the correct platform for your CI/CD needs. # <span id=\"page-56-2\"></span>Compare and contrast GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) and [Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines) have a common history. In fact, the Actions agent is a fork of the Pipelines agent. There are many similarities between GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines and it's worth comparing and contrasting them. #### <span id=\"page-56-3\"></span>**Pipelines as code** Before you compare GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines, you should consider the benefits of *pipelines as code*. Pipelines as code: [!div class=\"checklist\"] - Benefit from standard source control practices (such as code reviews via pull request and versioning). - Can be audited for changes just like any other files in the repository. - Don't require accessing a separate system or UI to edit. - Can fully codify the build, test, and deploy process for code. \u2022 Can usually be templatized to empower teams to create standard processes across multiple repositories. #### **Note** The term \"pipelines\" can also be referred to by several different interchangeable words: *pipeline*, *workflow*, and *build* are common terms. In this article, references to *Azure Pipelines* are referring to [YAML Pipelines,](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-get-started?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true#define-pipelines-using-yaml-syntax) and not the older UI-based [Classic Pipelines.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-get-started?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true#define-pipelines-using-the-classic-interface) #### <span id=\"page-57-0\"></span>**Agents and runners** Before you examine pipelines themselves, you should consider how these pipelines *execute*. Both GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines are really *orchestration engines*. When a pipeline is triggered, the system finds an \"agent\" and tells the agent to execute the jobs defined in the pipeline file. Azure", "Pipelines run on *agents*. The agent is written in .NET, so it will run wherever .NET can run: Windows, macOS, and Linux. Agents can even run in containers. Agents are registered to a [pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues) in Azure Pipelines or to a repository or organization in GitHub. Agents can be *hosted* or *private*. GitHub Workflows execute on *runners*. The runner code is essentially a fork of the Azure Pipelines code, so it's very similar. It's also cross-platform and you can also use *hosted* or *self-hosted* runners. #### **Hosted agents and runners** Hosted agents (Azure Pipelines) and hosted runners (GitHub) are agents that are spun up and managed by Azure DevOps or GitHub respectively. You don't need to maintain any build infrastructure. When a pipeline triggers that targets a hosted agent, an instance of the specified agent image is created. The job is run by the agent on the instance, and once the job completes, the instance is destroyed. The same applies for hosted runners running GitHub workflows. #### **Note** The list of software installed on Azure Pipelines images is listed in [this repository.](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/tree/main/images) You can select the platform folder and examine the *README.md* files. You can find information on [GitHub hosted](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners) [runners.](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners) #### **Private agents and self-hosted runners** There are times when you can't use hosted images. For example, when you: - Require SDKs or other software that isn't installed on the images. - Need to access resources that aren't public (such as an internal SonarQube server or an internal Artifactory instance). - Need to deploy to private networks. - Need to install licenses for third-party software required for building your code. - Need more storage or memory than is provided to the hosted agent images. - Need more time than the maximum build time limit for hosted agents. #### **Important** It's possible to install tools and SDKs when running pipelines on hosted agents. If the install steps don't take long, this is viable. However, if the tools/software take a long time to install, then you may be better off with a private agent or self-hosted runner, since the install steps will need to execute for every run of the workflow. #### **Azure DevOps agents** Every Azure DevOps account has a hosted pool with a single agent that can run one job at a time. Also included is a set number of free build minutes. You may purchase additional \"hosted pipelines\" in Azure DevOps. When you purchase an additional hosted pipeline, you're really removing the build minutes limit and adding *concurrency*. One pipeline can run one job at a time. Two pipelines can run two jobs simultaneously, and so on. #### **Comparison of agents** | Feature | GitHub | Azure Pipelines | Links | |------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------| | Hosted agents for<br>public<br>repos/projects | Free | Up to 10 free Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs<br>that can run for up to 360 minutes (6 hours)<br>each time with no overall time limit per<br>month.

A common workflow is Continuous Integration (CI), but Actions can automate other processes. For example, sending welcome emails when people join a repository. To explore moving code to the cloud, you'll build a GitHub Actions workflow file. The workflow file will be used for the Simple Feed Reader app you've already deployed to Azure App Service. In this article, you will: > [!div class=\"checklist\"] > > \\* Learn the basic structure of a GitHub Action workflow YAML file. > \\* Use a template to create a basic build workflow that builds the .NET app and executes unit tests. > \\* Publish the compiled app so that it's ready for deployment. #### <span id=\"page-61-1\"></span>**Workflow structure** Workflows are defined in YAML files, and contain several common nodes: - a name - a trigger, defined by an on section - one or more job sections composed of one or more steps - optional attributes such as environment variables Jobs are run on *runners*. You can use *hosted runners*, which are spun up by GitHub during the workflow and then thrown away. Hosted runners are great because you don't have to maintain your own build infrastructure. For workflows that require a specific build environment, or for running workflows on a private network, you can also use *private* runners. To create a private runner, install the runner on any machine that supports .NET. Each job will specify what runner GitHub should use to execute the steps. You can also specify dependencies between jobs using the needs attribute. Deployment jobs can also specify an environment to target. The steps node can be as easy as inline commands, or they can be actions. Most CI workflows will have a combination of run steps (for executing scripts) and actions. Individual actions are pulled into the workflow by referencing the GitHub Action repository (and optionally a tag or commit hash for specific versions) and specifying any parameters using the with keyword. #### **Tip** For more information, see [GitHub Actions YAML syntax.](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) From a workflow file, you're able to run any of the available [.NET CLI commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/). For example, if you're required to build, test, and deploy an ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly app with Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation, you'd use the following commands: - [dotnet workload install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-workload-install) - [dotnet restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore) - [dotnet build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build) - [dotnet test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test) - [dotnet publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) #### **The .NET SDK is a workflow necessity** All .NET workflows require the .NET SDK, and this can be set up by the [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) GitHub [Action.](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) This", "action sets up a [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/) environment for use in actions. Some [GitHub hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-software) have the .NET SDK preinstalled, but that's subject to change. As a best practice, use the actions/setupdotnet action to ensure the proper version is available. #### <span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>**Create a basic build workflow** A primary principle of effective DevOps is to \"build once, and deploy many times\". You'll start by creating a workflow to build a basic .NET app. In the next step, you'll publish the output to prepare for deployment. - 1. Navigate to your GitHub repository and select the **Actions** tab. - 2. GitHub detects that there's .NET code in the repository and suggests a .NET workflow template. Select **Set up this workflow** to create a new YAML workflow file: ![](_page_62_Picture_15.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 1\\*\\*: Creating a new workflow. 1. Commit the file onto the main branch. Since you've defined a trigger condition for *commits to main*, this commit should trigger the workflow to run. ![](_page_63_Picture_1.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 2\\*\\*: Commit the YAML file. 1. Select the **Actions** tab again. You should see a running workflow. Once the workflow has completed, you should see a successful run. ![](_page_63_Picture_4.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 3\\*\\*: Successful build view. 1. Opening the logs, you can see that the .NET build succeeded and the tests ran and passed. ![](_page_63_Picture_7.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 4\\*\\*: Checking the logs. #### **Note** If any of the tests fail, the workflow will fail. #### <span id=\"page-64-0\"></span>**Dissect the workflow file** Let's examine the workflow YAML file you have so far: ``` name: .NET on: push: branches: [ main ] pull_request: branches: [ main ] jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Setup .NET uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3 with: dotnet-version: 6.0.x - name: Restore dependencies run: dotnet restore - name: Build run: dotnet build --no-restore - name: Test run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal ``` #### Notice the following things: - 1. There's a name that names the workflow. - 2. The on object specifies when this workflow should run. This workflow has two events that trigger it: push to main and pull\\_request to main. Each time someone commits to main or creates a pull request (PR) to main, this workflow will execute. - 3. There's a single job called build. This build should run on a hosted agent. ubuntu\\_latest specifies the most recent Ubuntu hosted agent. - 4. There are five steps: - 1. actions/checkout@v3 is an action that checks out the code in the repository onto the runner. - 2. actions/setup-dotnet@v3 is an action that sets up the .NET CLI. This step also specifies a name attribute for the logs and the dotnet-version parameter within the with object. - 3. Three run steps that execute dotnet restore, dotnet build, and dotnet test. name attributes are also specified for these run steps to make the logs look pretty. #### <span id=\"page-65-0\"></span>**Publish the output** Now that you've successfully built and tested the code, add steps that publish the output so you can deploy the web app. 1.

There's nothing special about a deployment job, other than the fact that it references an *environment*. Environments are *logical* constructs that allow you to specify environment protection rules, such as approvals, on any group of resources that you're targeting. In this walkthrough, you'll be deploying to two environments: PRE-PROD and PROD. In a typical development lifecycle, you'll want to deploy the latest code to a *soft* environment (typically DEV) that is expected to be a bit", "unstable. You'll use PRE-PROD as this *soft* environment. The \"higher\" environments (like UAT and PROD) are *harder* environments that are expected to be more stable. To enforce this, you can build protection rules into higher environments. You'll configure an approval protection rule on the PROD environment: whenever a deployment job targets an environment with an approval rule, it will pause until approval is granted before executing. GitHub environments are *logical*. They represent the physical (or virtual) resources that you're deploying to. In this case, the PRE-PROD is just a deployment slot on the Azure Web App. PROD is the production slot. The PRE-PROD deployment job will deploy the published .NET app to the staging slot. The PROD deployment job will swap the slots. Once you have these steps in place, you'll update the workflow to handle environment-specific configuration using environment secrets. #### **Note** For more information, see [GitHub Actions -](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/environments) Environments. #### <span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>**Azure authentication** To perform actions such as deploying code to an Azure resource, you need the correct permissions. For deployment to Azure Web Apps, you can use a publishing profile. If you want to deploy to a staging slot, then you'll need the publishing profile for the slot too. Instead, you can use a service principal (SPN) and assign permission to this service principal. You can then authenticate using credentials for the SPN before using any commands that the SPN has permissions to perform. Once you have an SPN, you'll create a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to securely store the credentials. You can then refer to the secret whenever you need to authenticate. The secret is encrypted and once it has been saved, can never be viewed or edited (only deleted or re-created). #### **Create an SPN** - 1. In your terminal or Cloud Shell, run the following command to create a service principal with contributor permissions to the web app you created earlier: - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az ad sp create-for-rbac --name \"{sp-name}\" --sdk-auth role contributor \\ --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resourcegroup}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{webappname} ::: - 2. The command should output JSON that has credentials embedded: ``` :::{custom-style=CodeBox} json { \"clientId\": \"<GUID>\", \"clientSecret\": \"<GUID>\", \"subscriptionId\": \"<GUID>\", \"tenantId\": \"<GUID>\", ... } ::: ``` 3. Make sure to record the clientId, clientSecret, subscription, and tenantId. You can also leave the terminal open for copy/paste later. #### **Create a repository secret** - 1. Now you're going to create an encrypted secret to store the credentials. You'll create this secret at the repository level. - 2. Navigate to GitHub and select your repository **Settings** tab. Then select **Secrets**. Select **New repository secret**: ![](_page_69_Picture_4.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 1\\*\\*: Create a secret. 1. Copy and paste the JSON from the az ad sp create-for-rbac command into the body of the secret. You can create this JSON by hand too if you have the relevant fields for your SPN. The secret should be named AZURE\\_CREDENTIALS. Select **Add secret** to save the new secret: ![](_page_69_Picture_7.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 2\\*\\*: Add Azure credentials. 1. You'll consume this secret in a workflow in later steps. To access it,", "use the variable notation \\${{}}. In this case, \\${{ AZURE\\_CREDENTIAL }} will be populated with the JSON you saved. #### <span id=\"page-69-0\"></span>**Add environments** [Environments](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/environments) are used as a *logical boundary*. You can add approvals to environments to ensure quality. You can also track deployments to environments and specify environment-specific values (secrets) for configuration. For this example, you're going to split the actual Azure environment into two *logical* environments called PRE-PROD and PROD. When you deploy the web app, you'll deploy to the staging slot of the Azure web app, represented by the PRE-PROD environment. When you're ready to deploy to PROD, you'll just perform a slot swap. In this case, the only difference between the environments is the slot that you're deploying to. In real life, there would typically be different web apps (and separate web app plans), separate resource groups, and even separate subscriptions. Typically, there's an SPN per environment. You may want to override the AZURE\\_CREDENTIAL value that you saved as a repository secret by creating it as an *environment secret*. #### **Note** Precedence works from Environment to repository. If a targeted environment has a secret called MY\\_SECRET, then that value is used. If not, the repository value of MY\\_SECRET (if any) is used. 1. Select **Settings** and then **Environments** in your repository. Select **New Environment**: ![](_page_70_Picture_5.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 3\\*\\*: Create an environment. 1. Enter PRE-PROD and select **Configure environment**: ![](_page_70_Picture_8.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 4\\*\\*: Name the environment. - 1. Since deploying to a staging slot doesn't affect the web app, you can safely deploy to the slot without requiring an approval first. A reviewer could be added if desired. For this example, leave the Environment protection rules empty. - [!NOTE] If you target an environment in a workflow and it does not exist, an \"empty\" environment is created automatically. The environment would look exactly the same as the PRE-PROD environment - it would exist, but would not have any protection rules enabled. - 2. Select **Environments** again and again select **New Environment**. Now enter PROD as the name and select **Configure environment**. - 3. Check the **Required reviewers** rule and add yourself as a reviewer. Don't forget to select **Save protection rules**: ![](_page_71_Picture_4.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 5\\*\\*: Add protection rules. #### <span id=\"page-71-0\"></span>**Deploy to staging** You can now add additional jobs to the workflow to deploy to the environments! You'll start by adding a deployment to the PRE-PROD environment, which in this case is the web app staging slot. - 1. Navigate to the *.github/workflows/dotnet.yml* file and select the pencil icon to edit the file. - 2. You're going to use the web app name a few times in this workflow, and will need the name of the resource group too. You'll define the app and resource group names as variables. With the variables, you can maintain the values in one place in the workflow file. - 3. Add this snippet below the on block and above the jobs block: ``` :::{custom-style=CodeBox} ```yml env: app-name: \"\" rg-name: \"\" jobs: # <\u2013 this", "is the existing jobs line ``` ::: ``` [!WARNING] You'll need to replace <name of your web app> with the actual name of your web app, and <name of your resource group> with the actual name of your resource group. 4. Add a new job below the build job as follows: :::{custom-style=CodeBox} ```yml if-no-files-found: error # <\u2013 last line of build job: insert below this line deploy\\_staging: needs: build runs-on: ubuntu-latest ``` environment: name: PRE-PROD url: ${{ steps.deploywebapp.outputs.webapp-url }} steps: - name: Download a Build Artifact uses: actions/download-artifact@v3 with: name: website path: website - name: Login via Azure CLI uses: azure/login@v1 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} - name: Deploy web app id: deploywebapp uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2 with: app-name: ${{ env.app-name }} slot-name: staging package: website - name: az cli logout run: az logout ``` ``` ::: The preceding workflow defines several steps: - 1. You're creating a new job called deploy\\_staging. - 2. You specify a dependency using needs. This job needs the build job to complete successfully before it starts. - 3. This job also runs on the latest Ubuntu hosted agent, as specified with the runs-on attribute. - 4. You specify that this job is targeting the PRE-PROD environment using the environment object. You also specify the url property. This URL will be displayed in the workflow diagram, giving users an easy way to navigate to the environment. The value of this property is set as the output of the step with id deploywebapp, which is defined below. - 5. You're executing a download-artifact step to download the artifact (compiled web app) from the build job. - 6. You then login to Azure using the AZURE\\_CREDENTIALS secret you saved earlier. Note the \\${{ }} notation for dereferencing variables. - 7. You then perform a webapp-deploy, specifying the app-name, slot-name, and path to the downloaded artifact (package). This action also defines an output parameter that you use to set the url of the environment above. - 8. Finally, you execute a logout to log out of the Azure context. - 5. Commit the file. - 6. When the run completes, you should see two successful jobs. The URL for the PRE-PROD stage has been set and selecting it will navigate you to your web app staging slot: ![](_page_73_Picture_3.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 6\\*\\*: Deployment to PRE-PROD is successful. 1. Notice how the staging slot's direct URL contains -staging: ![](_page_73_Picture_6.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 7\\*\\*: The staging slot running. 1. You can also now see deployments. Navigate to https://{your repository url}/deployments to view your deployments: ![](_page_74_Picture_0.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 8\\*\\*: View deployments. #### <span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>**Deploy to production** Now that you've deployed successfully to PRE-PROD, you'll want to deploy to PROD. Deployment to PROD will be slightly different since you don't need to copy the website again - you just need to swap the staging slot with the production slot. You'll do this using an Azure CLI (az) command. - 1. Navigate to the *.github/workflows/dotnet.yml* file and select the pencil icon to edit the file. - 2. Add a new", "job below the deploy\\_staging job as follows: :::{custom-style=CodeBox} ```yml run: az logout # <\u2013 last line of previous job: insert below this line deploy\\_prod: needs: deploy\\_staging runs-on: ubuntu-latest ``` environment: name: PROD url: ${{ steps.slot_swap.outputs.url }} steps: - name: Login via Azure CLI uses: azure/login@v1 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} - name: Swap staging slot into production id: slot_swap run: | az webapp deployment slot swap -g ${{ env.rg-name }} -n ${{ env.app-name }} -s staging url=$(az webapp show -g ${{ env.rg-name }} -n ${{ env.app-name }} --query \"defaultHostName\" -o tsv) echo \"::set-output name=url::http://$url\" - name: az cli logout run: az logout ``` ::: ``` The deployment to the PROD environment workflow specifies several steps: - 1. Once again, you specify a new job deploy\\_prod that needs deploy\\_staging to complete before starting. - 2. You're targeting the PROD environment this time. Also, the url value is different from before. - 3. For the steps, you don't need to download the artifact since you're just going to perform a slot swap. You start by executing a login to the Azure context. - 4. The Swap staging slot into production step is a multi-line run command (note the use of the pipe symbol |). You also specify an id for this step so that you can refer to it (you refer to it in the url property of the environment). The first line executes the slot swap using the variables you defined above in the workflow. The second line uses an az webapp show command to extract the URL of the target web app. This final line uses ::set-output in an echo to create an output variable for this task, setting the value to the web app URL. [!NOTE] The URL *must* start with http:// or https:// or it won't render. - 3. Commit the file. - 4. Let the workflow run for a couple minutes until it has deployed to PRE-PROD. At this point, the workflow will pause and wait for the required approval since you're targeting the PROD environment, which requires an approval as defined earlier: ![](_page_75_Picture_5.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 9\\*\\*: Waiting for an approval. 1. Select **Review deployments**, select the **PROD** checkbox, optionally add a comment, and then select **Approve and deploy** to start the PROD job. ![](_page_75_Picture_8.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 10\\*\\*: Approve the PROD deployment. 1. The deployment should only take a few seconds. Once it has completed, the URL for the PROD environment will update. ![](_page_76_Figure_0.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 11\\*\\*: PROD deployment completed. 1. Selecting the PROD URL will navigate you to the PROD site. ![](_page_76_Picture_3.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 12\\*\\*: The PROD site. #### <span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>**Add a manual queue option** You now have an end-to-end build and deploy workflow, including approvals. One more change you can make is to add a manual trigger to the workflow so that the workflow can be triggered from within the **Actions** tab of the repository. - 1. Navigate to the *.github/workflows/dotnet.yml* file and select the pencil icon to edit the file. - 2. Add a new trigger between on", "and push on lines 3 and 4: - :::{custom-style=CodeBox} yml on: workflow\\_dispatch: # <-- this is the new line push: ::: - 3. The workflow\\_dispatch trigger displays a Run workflow button in the **Actions** tab of the repository\u2014*but only if the trigger is defined in the default branch*. However, once this trigger is defined in the workflow, you can select the branch for the run. - 4. Commit the file. 5. To see the **Run workflow** button, select the **Actions** tab. Select the .NET workflow in the list of workflows. At the top of the list of runs, you'll see the **Run workflow** button. If you select it, you can choose the branch to run the workflow against and queue it: ![](_page_77_Picture_1.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 13\\*\\*: Manual dispatch. #### <span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>**Handle environment configuration** Your workflow is deploying the same binary to each environment. This concept is important to ensure that the binaries you test in one environment are the same that you deploy to the next. However, environments typically have different settings like database connection strings. You want to ensure that the DEV app is using DEV settings and the PROD app is using PROD settings. For this simple app, there's no database connection string. However, there's an example configuration setting that you can modify for each environment. If you open the *simple-feedreader/SimpleFeedReader/appsettings.json* file, you'll see that the configuration includes a setting for the Header text on the Index page: ``` \"UI\": { \"Index\": { \"Header\": \"Simple News Reader\" } }, ``` To show how environment configuration can be handled, you're going to add a secret to each environment and then substitute that value into the settings as you deploy. #### **Add environment secrets** - 1. On your repository, select **Settings** > **Environments** > **PRE-PROD**. - 2. Select **Add secret** and add a secret called index\\_header with the value PRE PROD News Reader. Select **Add secret**. ![](_page_78_Picture_0.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 14\\*\\*: Add an environment secret. - 1. Repeat these steps to add a secret called index\\_header with the value PROD News Reader for the PROD environment. - 2. If you select **Settings** > **Secrets** in the repository, you'll see the changes. They should look something like this: ![](_page_78_Picture_4.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 15\\*\\*: View secrets. #### **Update the workflow to handle configuration** - 1. Navigate to the *.github/workflows/dotnet.yml* file and select the pencil icon to edit the file. - 2. Add the following step before the az cli logout step in the deploy\\_staging job: ``` :::{custom-style=CodeBox} ```yml - name: Update config uses: Azure/appservice-settings@v1 with: app-name: ${{ env.app-name }} slot-name: staging app-settings-json: | [ { \"name\": \"UI:Index:Header\", \"value\": \"${{ secrets.INDEX_HEADER }}\",\"slotSetting\": true } ] - name: az cli logout # <-- this exists already ``` ``` ::: 3. Add almost the same code to the deploy\\_prod job above its az cli logout step. The only difference is that you don't specify a slot-name, since you're targeting the production slot: ``` :::{custom-style=CodeBox} ```yml - name: Update config uses: Azure/appservice-settings@v1 with: app-name: ${{ env.app-name }} app-settings-json: | [ { \"name\":", "\"UI:Index:Header\", \"value\": \"${{ secrets.INDEX_HEADER }}\",\"slotSetting\": true } ] - name: az cli logout # <-- this exists already ``` ``` ::: 4. Commit the file. - 5. Let the workflow run and approve the deployment to PROD once the approval is reached. - 6. You should see the following headers on the index page for both sites: ![](_page_79_Picture_5.jpeg) \\*\\*Figure 16\\*\\*: Settings changed in the environments. #### <span id=\"page-79-0\"></span>**Final workflow file** The final workflow file should look like this: ``` name: .NET on: workflow_dispatch: inputs: reason: description: 'The reason for running the workflow' required: true default: 'Manual build from GitHub UI' push: branches: [ main ] pull_request: branches: [ main ] env: app-name: \"cd-simplefeedreader\" rg-name: \"cd-dotnetactions\" jobs: build: ``` ``` runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: 'Print manual run reason' if: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' }} run: | echo 'Reason: ${{ github.event.inputs.reason }}' - name: Setup .NET uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3 with: dotnet-version: 6.0.x - name: Restore dependencies run: dotnet restore - name: Build run: dotnet build --no-restore - name: Test run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal - name: Publish run: dotnet publish SimpleFeedReader/SimpleFeedReader.csproj -c Release -o website - name: Upload a Build Artifact uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3 with: name: website path: SimpleFeedReader/website/** if-no-files-found: error deploy_staging: needs: build runs-on: ubuntu-latest environment: name: STAGING url: ${{ steps.deploywebapp.outputs.webapp-url }} steps: - name: Download a Build Artifact uses: actions/download-artifact@v3 with: name: website path: website - name: Login via Azure CLI uses: azure/login@v1 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} - name: Deploy web app id: deploywebapp uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2 with: app-name: ${{ env.app-name }} slot-name: staging package: website - name: Update config uses: Azure/appservice-settings@v1 with: app-name: ${{ env.app-name }} slot-name: staging app-settings-json: | ``` ``` [ { \"name\": \"UI:Index:Header\", \"value\": \"${{ secrets.INDEX_HEADER }}\", \"slotSetting\": true } ] - name: az cli logout run: az logout deploy_prod: needs: deploy_staging runs-on: ubuntu-latest environment: name: PROD url: ${{ steps.slot_swap.outputs.url }} steps: - name: Login via Azure CLI uses: azure/login@v1 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} - name: Swap staging slot into production id: slot_swap run: | az webapp deployment slot swap -g ${{ env.rg-name }} -n ${{ env.app-name }} -s staging url=$(az webapp show -g ${{ env.rg-name }} -n ${{ env.app-name }} --query \"defaultHostName\" -o tsv) echo \"::set-output name=url::http://$url\" - name: Update config uses: Azure/appservice-settings@v1 with: app-name: ${{ env.app-name }} app-settings-json: | [ { \"name\": \"UI:Index:Header\", \"value\": \"${{ secrets.INDEX_HEADER }}\", \"slotSetting\": true } ] - name: az cli logout run: az logout ``` # <span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>Secure .NET Code with CodeQL and GitHub Actions [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/) is a static code analysis engine that can automate security and quality checks.

However, teams can benefit immensely from the large open-source collection of queries that the security community has created without having to write any custom CodeQL. In this article, you'll set up a GitHub workflow that will scan code in your repository using CodeQL. You will: [!div class=\"checklist\"] - Create a code scanning action. - Edit the workflow file to include custom scan settings. - See scanning results. #### **Note** To see security alerts for your repository, you must be a repository owner. #### <span id=\"page-82-0\"></span>**Create the code scanning workflow** You can use a starter workflow for code scanning by navigating to the **Security** tab of your repository. 1.

If the repository contained other languages, you could add them to this array. This causes the job to \"fan out\" and create an instance per value of the matrix. - 5. There are four steps, starting with checkout. - 6. The second step initializes the CodeQL scanner for the language this job is going", "to scan. CodeQL intercepts calls to the compiler to build a database of the code while the code is being built. - 7. The Autobuild step will attempt to automatically build the source code using common conventions. If this step fails, you can replace it with your own custom build steps. - 8. After building, the CodeQL analysis is performed, where suites of queries are run against the code database. - 9. The run should complete successfully.
