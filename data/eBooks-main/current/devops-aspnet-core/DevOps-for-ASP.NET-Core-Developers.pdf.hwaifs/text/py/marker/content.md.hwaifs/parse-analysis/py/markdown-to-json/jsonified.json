You don't need to know anything about Azure, as we'll cover that in this introduction. This guide may also be useful for DevOps engineers who are more focused on operations than development.\n\nThis guide targets Windows developers. However, Linux and macOS are fully supported by .NET Core. To adapt this guide for Linux/macOS, watch for callouts for Linux/macOS differences.", "What this guide doesn't cover": "This guide is focused on an end-to-end continuous deployment experience for .NET developers. It's not an exhaustive guide to all things Azure, and it doesn't focus extensively on .NET APIs for Azure services. The emphasis is all around continuous integration, deployment, monitoring, and debugging. Near the end of the guide, recommendations for next steps are offered. Included in the suggestions are Azure platform services that are useful to ASP.NET Core developers.", "What's in this guide": "**[Tools and downloads](xref:azure/devops/tools-and-downloads)**\n\nLearn

In fact, the Actions agent is a fork of the Pipelines agent. There are many similarities between GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines and it's worth comparing and contrasting them.\n\n<span id=\"page-56-3\"></span>**Pipelines as code**\n\nBefore you compare GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines, you should consider the benefits of *pipelines as code*. Pipelines as code:\n\n[!div class=\"checklist\"]\n\n['Benefit from standard source control practices (such as code reviews via pull request and versioning).', 'Can be audited for changes just like any other files in the repository.', \"Don't require accessing a separate system or UI to edit.\", 'Can fully codify the build, test, and deploy process for code.']\n\n\u2022 Can usually be templatized to empower teams to create standard processes across multiple repositories.\n\n**Note**\n\nThe term \"pipelines\" can also be referred to by several different interchangeable words: *pipeline*, *workflow*, and *build* are common terms. In this article, references to *Azure Pipelines* are referring to [YAML Pipelines,](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-get-started?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true#define-pipelines-using-yaml-syntax) and not the older UI-based [Classic Pipelines.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-get-started?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true#define-pipelines-using-the-classic-interface)\n\n<span id=\"page-57-0\"></span>**Agents and runners**\n\nBefore you examine pipelines themselves, you should consider how these pipelines *execute*. Both GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines are really *orchestration engines*. When a pipeline is triggered, the system finds an \"agent\" and tells the agent to execute the jobs defined in the pipeline file.\n\nAzure Pipelines run on *agents*. The agent is written in .NET, so it will run wherever .NET can run: Windows, macOS, and Linux. Agents can even run in containers. Agents are registered to a [pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues) in Azure Pipelines or to a repository or organization in GitHub. Agents can be *hosted* or *private*.\n\nGitHub Workflows execute on *runners*. The runner code is essentially a fork of the Azure Pipelines code, so it's very similar. It's also cross-platform and you can also use *hosted* or *self-hosted* runners.\n\n**Hosted agents and runners**\n\nHosted agents (Azure Pipelines) and hosted runners (GitHub) are agents that are spun up and managed by Azure DevOps or GitHub respectively. You don't need to maintain any build infrastructure. When a pipeline triggers that targets a hosted agent, an instance of the specified agent image is created. The job is run by the agent on the instance, and once the job completes, the instance is destroyed. The same applies for hosted runners running GitHub workflows.\n\n**Note**\n\nThe list of software installed on Azure Pipelines images is listed in [this repository.](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/tree/main/images) You can select the platform folder and examine the *README.md* files. You can find information on [GitHub hosted](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners)  [runners.](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners)\n\n**Private agents and self-hosted runners**\n\nThere are times when you can't use hosted images. For example, when you:\n\n[\"Require SDKs or other software that isn't installed on the images.\", \"Need to access resources that aren't public (such as an internal SonarQube server or an internal Artifactory instance).\", 'Need to deploy to private networks.', 'Need to install licenses for third-party software required for building your code.', 'Need more storage or memory than is provided to the hosted agent images.', 'Need more time than the maximum build time limit for hosted agents.']\n\n**Important**\n\nIt's possible to install tools and SDKs when running pipelines on hosted agents. If the install steps don't take long, this is viable. However, if the tools/software take a long time to install, then you may be better off with a private agent or self-hosted runner, since the install steps will need to execute for every run of the workflow.\n\n**Azure DevOps agents**\n\nEvery Azure DevOps account has a hosted pool with a single agent that can run one job at a time. Also included is a set number of free build minutes. You may purchase additional \"hosted pipelines\" in Azure DevOps. When you purchase an additional hosted pipeline, you're really removing the build minutes limit and adding *concurrency*. One pipeline can run one job at a time. Two pipelines can run two jobs simultaneously, and so on.\n\n**Comparison of agents**\n\n| Feature                                        | GitHub                                                                                                                                                                           | Azure Pipelines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Links                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Hosted agents for<br>public<br>repos/projects  | Free                                                                                                                                                                             | Up to 10 free Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs<br>that can run for up to 360 minutes (6 hours)<br>each time with no overall time limit per<br>month.

Be sure to check documentation carefully before deciding which platform is right for you.", "<span id=\"page-61-0\"></span>Build a .NET web app using GitHub Actions": "[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) allow you to automate workflows in response to events that are triggered in GitHub. A common workflow is Continuous Integration (CI), but Actions can automate other processes. For example, sending welcome emails when people join a repository.\n\nTo explore moving code to the cloud, you'll build a GitHub Actions workflow file. The workflow file will be used for the Simple Feed Reader app you've already deployed to Azure App Service.\n\nIn this article, you will: > [!div class=\"checklist\"] > > \\* Learn the basic structure of a GitHub Action workflow YAML file. > \\* Use a template to create a basic build workflow that builds the .NET app and executes unit tests. > \\* Publish the compiled app so that it's ready for deployment.\n\n<span id=\"page-61-1\"></span>**Workflow structure**\n\nWorkflows are defined in YAML files, and contain several common nodes:\n\n['a name', 'a trigger, defined by an on section', 'one or more job sections composed of one or more steps', 'optional attributes such as environment variables']\n\nJobs are run on *runners*. You can use *hosted runners*, which are spun up by GitHub during the workflow and then thrown away. Hosted runners are great because you don't have to maintain your own build infrastructure. For workflows that require a specific build environment, or for running workflows on a private network, you can also use *private* runners. To create a private runner, install the runner on any machine that supports .NET.\n\nEach job will specify what runner GitHub should use to execute the steps. You can also specify dependencies between jobs using the needs attribute. Deployment jobs can also specify an environment to target.\n\nThe steps node can be as easy as inline commands, or they can be actions. Most CI workflows will have a combination of run steps (for executing scripts) and actions. Individual actions are pulled into the workflow by referencing the GitHub Action repository (and optionally a tag or commit hash for specific versions) and specifying any parameters using the with keyword.\n\n**Tip**\n\nFor more information, see [GitHub Actions YAML syntax.](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)\n\nFrom a workflow file, you're able to run any of the available [.NET CLI commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/). For example, if you're required to build, test, and deploy an ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly app with Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation, you'd use the following commands:\n\n['[dotnet workload install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-workload-install)', '[dotnet restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore)', '[dotnet build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build)', '[dotnet test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test)', '[dotnet publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish)']\n\n**The .NET SDK is a workflow necessity**\n\nAll .NET workflows require the .NET SDK, and this can be set up by the [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) GitHub [Action.](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) This action sets up a [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/) environment for use in actions. Some [GitHub hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-software) have the .NET SDK preinstalled, but that's subject to change. As a best practice, use the actions/setupdotnet action to ensure the proper version is available.\n\n<span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>**Create a basic build workflow**\n\nA primary principle of effective DevOps is to \"build once, and deploy many times\".

There's nothing special about a deployment job, other than the fact that it references an\n\n*environment*. Environments are *logical* constructs that allow you to specify environment protection rules, such as approvals, on any group of resources that you're targeting.\n\nIn this walkthrough, you'll be deploying to two environments: PRE-PROD and PROD. In a typical development lifecycle, you'll want to deploy the latest code to a *soft* environment (typically DEV) that is expected to be a bit unstable. You'll use PRE-PROD as this *soft* environment. The \"higher\" environments (like UAT and PROD) are *harder* environments that are expected to be more stable. To enforce this, you can build protection rules into higher environments. You'll configure an approval protection rule on the PROD environment: whenever a deployment job targets an environment with an approval rule, it will pause until approval is granted before executing.\n\nGitHub environments are *logical*. They represent the physical (or virtual) resources that you're deploying to. In this case, the PRE-PROD is just a deployment slot on the Azure Web App. PROD is the production slot. The PRE-PROD deployment job will deploy the published .NET app to the staging slot. The PROD deployment job will swap the slots.\n\nOnce you have these steps in place, you'll update the workflow to handle environment-specific configuration using environment secrets.\n\n**Note**\n\nFor more information, see [GitHub Actions -](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/environments) Environments.\n\n<span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>**Azure authentication**\n\nTo perform actions such as deploying code to an Azure resource, you need the correct permissions. For deployment to Azure Web Apps, you can use a publishing profile. If you want to deploy to a staging slot, then you'll need the publishing profile for the slot too. Instead, you can use a service principal (SPN) and assign permission to this service principal. You can then authenticate using credentials for the SPN before using any commands that the SPN has permissions to perform.\n\nOnce you have an SPN, you'll create a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to securely store the credentials. You can then refer to the secret whenever you need to authenticate. The secret is encrypted and once it has been saved, can never be viewed or edited (only deleted or re-created).\n\n**Create an SPN**\n\n[['In your terminal or Cloud Shell, run the following command to create a service principal with contributor permissions to the web app you created earlier:'], [':::{custom-style=CodeBox} azurecli az ad sp create-for-rbac --name \"{sp-name}\" --sdk-auth role contributor \\\\ --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resourcegroup}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{webappname} :::'], ['The command should output JSON that has credentials embedded:']]\n\n```\n:::{custom-style=CodeBox} json { \"clientId\": \"<GUID>\", \"clientSecret\": \"<GUID>\", \n\"subscriptionId\": \"<GUID>\", \"tenantId\": \"<GUID>\", ... } :::\n```\n\n['Make sure to record the clientId, clientSecret, subscription, and tenantId. You can also leave the terminal open for copy/paste later.']\n\n**Create a repository secret**\n\n[[\"Now you're going to create an encrypted secret to store the credentials.

To access it, use the variable notation \\\\${{}}. In this case, \\\\${{ AZURE\\\\_CREDENTIAL }} will be populated with the JSON you saved.\"]\n\n<span id=\"page-69-0\"></span>**Add environments**\n\n[Environments](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/environments) are used as a *logical boundary*. You can add approvals to environments to ensure quality. You can also track deployments to environments and specify environment-specific values (secrets) for configuration.\n\nFor this example, you're going to split the actual Azure environment into two *logical* environments called PRE-PROD and PROD. When you deploy the web app, you'll deploy to the staging slot of the Azure web app, represented by the PRE-PROD environment. When you're ready to deploy to PROD, you'll just perform a slot swap.\n\nIn this case, the only difference between the environments is the slot that you're deploying to. In real life, there would typically be different web apps (and separate web app plans), separate resource groups, and even separate subscriptions. Typically, there's an SPN per environment. You may want to override the AZURE\\_CREDENTIAL value that you saved as a repository secret by creating it as an *environment secret*.\n\n**Note**\n\nPrecedence works from Environment to repository. If a targeted environment has a secret called MY\\_SECRET, then that value is used. If not, the repository value of MY\\_SECRET (if any) is used.\n\n['Select **Settings** and then **Environments** in your repository.

If the repository contained other languages, you could add them to this array. This causes the job to \"fan out\" and create an instance per value of the matrix.\n- 5. There are four steps, starting with checkout.\n- 6. The second step initializes the CodeQL scanner for the language this job is going to scan. CodeQL intercepts calls to the compiler to build a database of the code while the code is being built.\n- 7. The Autobuild step will attempt to automatically build the source code using common conventions. If this step fails, you can replace it with your own custom build steps.\n- 8.

In the menu to the left, scroll down to the **Monitoring** section and select **Log stream**.\n\n![](_page_94_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nLogs can also be [streamed via Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell,](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-enable-diagnostic-log#streamlogs) including through the Cloud Shell.\n\n# <span id=\"page-94-0\"></span>Alerts\n\nAzure Monitor also provides [real time alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-alerts-portal) based on metrics, administrative events, and other criteria.\n\n#### **Note**\n\nCurrently alerting on web app metrics is only available in the Alerts (classic) service.\n\nThe [Alerts \\(classic\\) service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitor-quick-resource-metric-alert-portal) can be found in Azure Monitor or under the **Monitoring** section of the App Service settings.\n\n![](_page_94_Picture_7.jpeg)\n\n# <span id=\"page-94-1\"></span>Live debugging\n\nAzure App Service can be [debugged remotely with Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-dotnet-troubleshoot-visual-studio#remotedebug) when logs don't provide enough information. However, remote debugging requires the app to be compiled with debug symbols. Debugging shouldn't be done in production, except as a last resort.\n\n# <span id=\"page-95-0\"></span>Conclusion\n\nIn this section, you completed the following tasks:\n\n[!div class=\"checklist\"]\n\n- Find basic monitoring and troubleshooting data in the Azure portal\n- Learn how Azure Monitor provides a deeper look at metrics across all Azure services\n- Connect the web app with Application Insights for app profiling\n- Turn on logging and learn where to download logs\n- Stream logs in real time\n- Learn where to set up alerts\n- <span id=\"page-95-1\"></span>\u2022 Learn about remote debugging Azure App Service web apps.\n\n# Additional reading\n\n- [Troubleshooting ASP.NET Core on Azure App Service and IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/test/troubleshoot-azure-iis)\n- [Common errors reference for Azure App Service and IIS with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/azure-iis-errors-reference)\n- [Monitor Azure web app performance with Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-azure-web-apps)\n- [Enable diagnostics logging for web apps in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-enable-diagnostic-log)\n- [Troubleshoot a web app in Azure App Service using Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-dotnet-troubleshoot-visual-studio)\n- [Create classic metric alerts in Azure Monitor for Azure services -](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-alerts-portal) Azure portal\n\n**CHAPTER** 5\n\n# <span id=\"page-96-0\"></span>Next steps\n\nIn this guide, you created a DevOps pipeline for an ASP.NET Core sample app. Congratulations! We hope you enjoyed learning to publish ASP.NET Core web apps to Azure App Service and automate the continuous integration of changes.\n\nBeyond web hosting and DevOps, Azure has a wide array of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services useful to ASP.NET Core developers. This section gives a brief overview of some of the most commonly used services.\n\n# <span id=\"page-96-1\"></span>Storage and databases\n\n[Redis Cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/redis-cache/) is high-throughput, low-latency data caching available as a service. It can be used for caching page output, reducing database requests, and providing ASP.NET Core session state across multiple instances of an app.\n\n[Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/) is Azure's massively scalable cloud storage. Developers can take advantage of [Queue](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction)  [Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction) for reliable message queuing, and [Table Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-overview) is a NoSQL key-value store designed for rapid development using massive, semi-structured data sets.\n\n[Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/) provides familiar relational database functionality as a service using the Microsoft SQL Server Engine.\n\n[Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/) globally distributed, multi-model NoSQL database service. Multiple APIs are available, including SQL API (formerly called DocumentDB), Cassandra, and MongoDB.\n\n# <span id=\"page-96-2\"></span>Identity\n\n[Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/) and [Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/) are both identity services. Azure Active Directory is designed for enterprise scenarios and enables Azure AD B2B (business-to-business) collaboration, while Azure Active Directory B2C is intended business-to-customer scenarios, including social network sign-in.\n\n# <span id=\"page-96-3\"></span>Mobile\n\n[Notification Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notification-hubs/) is a multi-platform, scalable push-notification engine to quickly send millions of messages to apps running on various types of devices.\n\n# <span id=\"page-97-0\"></span>Web infrastructure\n\n[Azure Container Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/) manages your hosted Kubernetes environment, making it quick and easy to deploy and manage containerized apps without container orchestration expertise.\n\n[Azure Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/) is used to create an enterprise search solution over private, heterogenous content.\n\n[Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/) is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices and containers.\n```"}
