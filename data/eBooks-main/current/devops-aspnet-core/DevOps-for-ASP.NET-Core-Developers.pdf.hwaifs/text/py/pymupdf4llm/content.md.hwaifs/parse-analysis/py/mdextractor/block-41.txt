Your workflow is deploying the same binary to each environment. This concept is important to ensure
that the binaries you test in one environment are the same that you deploy to the next. However,
environments typically have different settings like database connection strings. You want to ensure
that the DEV app is using DEV settings and the PROD app is using PROD settings.


For this simple app, there’s no database connection string. However, there’s an example configuration
setting that you can modify for each environment. If you open the _simple-feed-_
_reader/SimpleFeedReader/appsettings.json_ file, you’ll see that the configuration includes a setting for
the Header text on the Index page:


To show how environment configuration can be handled, you’re going to add a secret to each
environment and then substitute that value into the settings as you deploy.


**Add environment secrets**


1. On your repository, select **Settings**  - **Environments**  - **PRE-PROD** .

2. Select **Add secret** and add a secret called index_header with the value PRE PROD News
Reader. Select **Add secret** .
