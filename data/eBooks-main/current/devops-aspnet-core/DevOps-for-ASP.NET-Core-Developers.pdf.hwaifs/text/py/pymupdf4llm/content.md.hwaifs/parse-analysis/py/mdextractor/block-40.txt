1. Navigate to the _.github/workflows/dotnet.yml_ file and select the pencil icon to edit the file.


2. Add a new trigger between on and push on lines 3 and 4:


:::{custom-style=CodeBox} yml on:  workflow_dispatch:  # <-- this is the new line  push: :::


3. The workflow_dispatch trigger displays a Run workflow button in the **Actions** tab of the
repository— _but only if the trigger is defined in the default branch_ . However, once this trigger is
defined in the workflow, you can select the branch for the run.


4. Commit the file.
