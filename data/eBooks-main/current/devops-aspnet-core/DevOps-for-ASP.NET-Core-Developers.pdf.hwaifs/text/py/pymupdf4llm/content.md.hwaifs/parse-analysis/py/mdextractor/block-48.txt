### Secure .NET Code with CodeQL and GitHub Actions

[CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/) is a static code analysis engine that can automate security and quality checks. With CodeQL,
you can perform _variant analysis_, which uses known vulnerabilities as seeds to find similar issues.
[CodeQL is part of GitHub Advanced Security that includes:](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/about-github-advanced-security)

  - Code scanning—find potential security vulnerabilities in your code.

  - Secret scanning—detect secrets and tokens that are committed.

  - Dependency scanning—detect vulnerabilities in packages that you consume.


[CodeQL supports some of the most popular programming languages and compilers:](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/)


  - C/C++

  - Java

  - C#

  - Python

  - Go

  - JavaScript

  - TypeScript


CodeQL is a powerful language and security professionals can create custom queries using CodeQL.
However, teams can benefit immensely from the large open-source collection of queries that the
security community has created without having to write any custom CodeQL.


In this article, you’ll set up a GitHub workflow that will scan code in your repository using CodeQL.
You will:


[!div class=“checklist”]


  - Create a code scanning action.

  - Edit the workflow file to include custom scan settings.

  - See scanning results.






#### **Create the code scanning workflow**

You can use a starter workflow for code scanning by navigating to the **Security** tab of your repository.


1. Navigate to your GitHub repository and select the **Security**  - **Code Scanning Alerts** . The top
recommended workflow should be CodeQL Analysis. Select **Set up this workflow** .
