Environments are logical constructs that allow you to specify environment protection rules, such as approvals, on any group of resources that you're targeting.\n\nIn this walkthrough, you'll be deploying to two environments: PRE -PROD and PROD. In a typical development lifecycle, you'll want to deploy the latest code to a soft environment (typically DEV) that is expected to be a bit unstable. You'll use PRE -PROD as this soft environment. The 'higher' environments (like UAT and PROD) are harder environments that are expected to be more stable. To enforce this, you can build protection rules into higher environments. You'll configure an approval protection rule on the PROD environment: whenever a deployment job targets an environment with an approval rule, it will pause until approval is granted before executing.\n\nGitHub environments are logical . They represent the physical (or virtual) resources that you're deploying to. In this case, the PRE-PROD is just a deployment slot on the Azure Web App. PROD is the production slot.

When you deploy the web app, you'll deploy to the staging slot of the Azure web app, represented by the PREPROD environment. When you're ready to deploy to PROD, you'll just perform a slot swap.\n\nIn this case, the only difference between the environments is the slot that you're deploying to. In real life, there would typically be different web apps (and separate web app plans), separate resource groups, and even separate subscriptions. Typically, t here's an SPN per environment. You may want to override the AZURE\\_CREDENTIAL value that you saved as a repository secret by creating it as an environment secret .", "Deploy to staging": "You can now add additional jobs to the workflow to deploy to the environments!

You're creating a new job called deploy\\_staging.\n2. You specify a dependency using needs. This job needs the build job to complete successfully before it starts.\n3. This job also runs on the latest Ubuntu hosted agent, as specified with the runs-on attribute.\n4. You specify that this job is targeting the PRE-PROD environment using the environment object. You also specify the url property. This URL will be displayed in the workflow diagram, giving users an easy way to navigate to the environment. The value of this property is set as the output of the step with id deploywebapp, which is defined below.\n5. You're executing a download -artifact step to download the artifact (compiled web app) from the build job.\n6. You then login to Azure using the AZURE\\_CREDENTIALS secret you saved earlier. Note the ${{ }} notation for dereferencing variables.\n7. You then perform a webapp-deploy, specifying the app-name, slot-name, and path to the downloaded artifact (package).

You'll do this using an Azure CLI (az) command.\n\n1. Navigate to the .github/workflows/dotnet.yml file and select the pencil icon to edit the file.\n2. Add a new job below the deploy\\_staging job as follows:\n3. :::{custom-style=CodeBox} ```yml run: az logout # &lt; -last line of previous job: insert below this line\n\ndeploy\\_prod: needs: deploy\\_staging runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n```\n\nenvironment: name: PROD url: ${{ steps.slot_swap.outputs.url }} steps: - name: Login via Azure CLI uses: azure/login@v1 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} - name: Swap staging slot into production id: slot_swap run: | az webapp deployment slot swap -g ${{ env.rg-name }} -n ${{ env.app-name }} -s staging url=$(az webapp show -g ${{ env.rg-name }} -n ${{ env.app-name }} --query \"defaultHostName\" -o tsv) echo \"::set-output name=url::http://$url\" - name: az cli logout run: az logout ``` :::\n\n```\n\nThe deployment to the PROD environment workflow specifies several steps:\n\n1.

For the steps, you don't need to download the artifact since you're just going to perform a slot swap. You start by executing a login to the Azure context.\n4. The Swap staging slot into production step is a multi-line run command (note the use of the pipe symbol |). You also specify an id for this step so that you can refer to it (you refer to it in the url property of the environment). The first line executes the slot swap using the variables you defined above in the workflow. The second line uses an az webapp show command to extract the URL of the target web app. This final line uses ::set-output in an echo to create an output variable for this task, setting the value to the web app URL.\n\n[!NOTE] The URL must start with http:// or https:// or it won't render.\n\n3.

This concept is important to ensure that the binaries you test in one environment are the same that you deploy to the next. However, environments typically have different settings like database connection strings. You want to ensure that the DEV app is using DEV settings and the PROD app is using PROD settings.\n\nFor this simple app, there's no database connection string. However, there's an example configuration setting that you can modify for each environment. If you open the simple-feed- reader/SimpleFeedReader/appsettings.json file, you'll see that the configuration includes a setting for the Header text on the Index page:\n\n```\n\n\"UI\": { \"Index\": { \"Header\": \"Simple News Reader\" } } ,\n\n```\n\nTo show how environment configuration can be handled, you're going to add a secret to each environment and then substitute that value into the settings as you deploy.\n\n## Add environment secrets\n\n1.

The workflow name is CodeQL.\n2. This workflow triggers on push and pull\\_request events to the main branch. There's also a cron trigger. The cron trigger lets you define a schedule for triggering this workflow and is randomly generated for you. In this case, this workflow will run at 14:40 UTC every Saturday.\n\n[!TIP] If you edit the workflow file and hover over the cron expression, a tooltip will show you the English text for the cron expression.\n\n3. There's a single job called analyze that runs on the ubuntu -latest hosted agent.\n4. This workflow defines a strategy with a matrix on the array of language. In this case, there's only csharp. If the repository contained other languages, you could add them to this array. This causes the job to 'fan out' and create an instance per value of the matrix.\n5. There are four steps, starting with checkout.\n6. The second step initializes the CodeQL scanner for the language this job is going to scan. CodeQL intercepts calls to the compiler to build a database of the code while the code is being built.\n7. The Autobuild step will attempt to automatically build the source code using common conventions. If this step fails, you can replace it with your own custom build steps.\n8. After building, the CodeQL analysis is performed, where suites of queries are run against the code database.\n9. The run should complete successfully.

Enable the logs with the following steps:\n\n1. Open the Azure portal, and navigate to the mywebapp&lt;unique\\_number&gt; App Service.\n2. In the menu to the left, scroll down to the Monitoring section. Select Diagnostics logs .\n1. Turn on Application Logging (Filesystem) . If prompted, click the box to install the extensions to enable app logging in the web app.\n2. Set Web server logging to File System .\n3. Enter the Retention Period in days. For example, 30.\n4. Click Save .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nASP.NET Core and web server (App Service) logs are generated for the web app. They can be downloaded using the FTP/FTPS information displayed. The password is the same as the deployment credentials created earlier in this guide. The logs can be streamed directly to your local machine with PowerShell or Azure CLI. Logs can also be viewed in Application Insights.\n\n## Log streaming\n\nApp and web server logs can be streamed in real time through the portal.\n\n1. Open the Azure portal, and navigate to the mywebapp&lt;unique\\_number&gt; App Service.\n2.

However, remote debugging requires the app to be compiled with debug symbols. Debugging shouldn't be done in production, except as a last resort.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this section, you completed the following tasks:\n\n[!div class='checklist']\n\n- Find basic monitoring and troubleshooting data in the Azure portal\n- Learn how Azure Monitor provides a deeper look at metrics across all Azure services\n- Connect the web app with Application Insights for app profiling\n- Turn on logging and learn where to download logs\n- Stream logs in real time\n- Learn where to set up alerts\n- Learn about remote debugging Azure App Service web apps.\n\n## Additional reading\n\n| \u2022   | Troubleshooting ASP.NET Core on Azure App Service and IIS                       |\n|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2022   | Common errors reference for Azure App Service and IIS with ASP.NET Core         |\n| \u2022   | Monitor Azure web app performance with Application Insights                     |\n| \u2022   | Enable diagnostics logging for web apps in Azure App Service                    |\n| \u2022   | Troubleshoot a web app in Azure App Service using Visual Studio                 |\n| \u2022   | Create classic metric alerts in Azure Monitor for Azure services - Azure portal |\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn this guide, you created a DevOps pipeline for an ASP.NET Core sample app. Congratulations! We hope you enjoyed learning to publish ASP.NET Core web apps to Azure App Service and automate the continuous integration of changes.\n\nBeyond web hosting and DevOps, Azure has a wide array of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services useful to ASP.NET Core developers. This section gives a brief overview of some of the most commonly used services.\n\n## Storage and databases\n\nRedis Cache is high-throughput, low-latency data caching available as a service. It can be used for caching page output, reducing database requests, and providing ASP.NET Core session state across multiple instances of an app.\n\nAzure Storage is Azure's massively scalable cloud storage. Developers can take advantage of Queue Storage for reliable message queuing, and Table Storage is a NoSQL key-value store designed for rapid development using massive, semi-structured data sets.\n\nAzure SQL Database provides familiar relational database functionality as a service using the Microsoft SQL Server Engine.\n\nCosmos DB globally distributed, multi-model NoSQL database service. Multiple APIs are available, including SQL API (formerly called DocumentDB), Cassandra, and MongoDB.\n\n## Identity\n\nAzure Active Directory and Azure Active Directory B2C are both identity services. Azure Active Directory is designed for enterprise scenarios and enables Azure AD B2B (business-to-business) collaboration, while Azure Active Directory B2C is intended business-to-customer scenarios, including social network sign-in.\n\n## Mobile\n\nNotification Hubs is a multi-platform, scalable push-notification engine to quickly send millions of messages to apps running on various types of devices.\n\n## Web infrastructure\n\nAzure Container Service manages your hosted Kubernetes environment, making it quick and easy to deploy and manage containerized apps without container orchestration expertise. Azure Search is used to create an enterprise search solution over private, heterogenous content. Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage\n\nscalable and reliable microservices and containers.\n```"}}
