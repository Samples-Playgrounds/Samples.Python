1,An important benefit of domain events is that side effects can be expressed explicitly.,
2,"For example, if you’re just using Entity Framework and there has to be a reaction to some would probably code whatever you need close to what triggers the event. So the rule gets implicitly, to the code, and you have to look into the code to, hopefully, realize the rule is implemented there.","event, you coupled,"

7,"Domain events are similar to messaging-style events, with one important difference. With real messaging, message queuing, message brokers, or a service bus using AMQP, a message is sent asynchronously and communicated across processes and machines. This is useful for multiple Bounded Contexts, microservices, or even different applications. However, with events, you want to raise an event from the domain operation you’re currently running, but any side effects to occur within the same domain.",always integrating domain you want
