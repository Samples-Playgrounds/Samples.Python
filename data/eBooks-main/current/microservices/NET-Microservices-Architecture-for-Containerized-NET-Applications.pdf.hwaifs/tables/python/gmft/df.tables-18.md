|  0 | In Kubernetes, if you don’t use any ingress approach, then your services and pods have IPs routable by the cluster network.                                                                                                                                                                | only                             |
|  1 | But if you use an ingress approach, you’ll have a middle tier between the Internet and your (including your API Gateways), acting as a reverse proxy.                                                                                                                                      | services                         |
|  2 | As a definition, an Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the services. An ingress is configured to provide services externally reachable URLs, load balance SSL termination and more. Users request ingress by POSTing the Ingress resource to the API | cluster traffic, server.         |
|  3 | In eShopOnContainers, when developing locally and using just your development machine as Docker host, you are not using any ingress but only the multiple API Gateways.                                                                                                                    | the                              |

That way, the clients still call the same base URL requests are routed to multiple API Gateways or BFF.                                                             | eShopOnContainers is but the     |

|  6 | The ingress, however, is just redirecting HTTP requests but not trying to hide any microservice app.                                                                                                                                                                                       | or web                           |
