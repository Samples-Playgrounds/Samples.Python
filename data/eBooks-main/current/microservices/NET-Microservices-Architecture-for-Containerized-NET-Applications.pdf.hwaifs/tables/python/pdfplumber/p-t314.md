|  1 | The HttpClient instances injected by DI can be disposed of safely, because the associated           |
|  2 | HttpMessageHandler is managed by the factory. Injected HttpClient instances are Transient from a DI |
|  3 | perspective, while HttpMessageHandler instances can be regarded as Scoped. HttpMessageHandler       |
|  4 | instances have their own DI scopes, separate from the application scopes (for example, ASP.NET      |
|  5 | incoming request scopes). For more information, see Using HttpClientFactory in .NET.                |
