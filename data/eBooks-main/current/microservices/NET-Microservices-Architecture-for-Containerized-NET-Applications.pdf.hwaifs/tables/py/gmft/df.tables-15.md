|  3 | Distributed application. Distributing the application adds complexity for developers when designing and building the services. For example, developers must implement inter-service communication using protocols like HTTP or AMQP, which adds complexity for testing and handling. It also adds latency to the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | they are exception                                                      |
|  4 | Deployment complexity. An application that has dozens of microservices types and needs scalability (it needs to be able to create many instances per service and balance those services hosts) means a high degree of deployment complexity for IT operations and not using a microservice-oriented infrastructure (like an orchestrator and scheduler), additional complexity can require far more development efforts than the business application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | high across management.

When the application is large, of microservices, there are challenges and limitations if the application requires direct client￾to-microservice communications. One problem is a potential mismatch between the needs of and the APIs exposed by each of the microservices. In certain cases, the client make many separate requests to compose the UI, which can be inefficient over the would be impractical over a mobile network. Therefore, requests from the client back-end system should be minimized.                                                                                                                     | with the application might Internet application to the                  |
|  8 | problem with direct client-to-microservice communications is that some protocols that are not Web-friendly. One service might use a binary protocol, while might use AMQP messaging. Those protocols are not firewall-friendly and are best internally. Usually, an application should use protocols such as HTTP and WebSockets for communication outside of the firewall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | microservices might another used                                        |
