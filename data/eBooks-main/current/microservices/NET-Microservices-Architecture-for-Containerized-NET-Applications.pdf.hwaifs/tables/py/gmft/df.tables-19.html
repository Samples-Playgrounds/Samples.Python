      <td>owned entity type allows you to map types that do not have their own identity explicitly defined in domain model and are used as properties, such as a value object, within any of your entities. An entity type shares the same CLR type with another entity type (that is, it’s just a regular class). entity containing the defining navigation is the owner entity. When querying the owner, the types are included by default.</td>
