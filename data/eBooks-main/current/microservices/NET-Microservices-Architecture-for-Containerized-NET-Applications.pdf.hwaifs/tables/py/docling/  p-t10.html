      <td>Virtual machines include the application, the required libraries or binaries, and a full guest operating system. Full virtualization requires more resources than containerization.</td>
      <td>Containers include the application and all its dependencies. However, they share the OS kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system. (Except in Hyper-V containers, where each container runs inside of a special virtual machine per container.)</td>
