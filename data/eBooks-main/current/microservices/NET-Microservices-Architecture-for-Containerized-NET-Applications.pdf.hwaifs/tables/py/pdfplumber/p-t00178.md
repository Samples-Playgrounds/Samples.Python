|  1 | The reference microservice application eShopOnContainers is currently using features provided by       |
|  2 | Envoy to implement the API Gateway instead of the earlier referenced Ocelot. We made this design       |
|  3 | choice because of Envoy’s built-in support for the WebSocket protocol, required by the new gRPC        |
|  4 | inter-service communications implemented in eShopOnContainers. However, we’ve retained this            |
|  5 | section in the guide so you can consider Ocelot as a simple, capable, and lightweight API Gateway      |
|  6 | suitable for production-grade scenarios. Also, latest Ocelot version contains a breaking change on its |
|  7 | json schema. Consider using Ocelot < v16.0.0, or use the key Routes instead of ReRoutes.               |
