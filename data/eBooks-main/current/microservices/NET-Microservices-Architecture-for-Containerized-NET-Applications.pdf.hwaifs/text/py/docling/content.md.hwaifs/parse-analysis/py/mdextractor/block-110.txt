public void SetAddress(Address address) { _shippingAddress = address?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(address)); } A better example would demonstrate the need to ensure that either the internal state did not change, or that all the mutations for a method occurred. For example, the following implementation would leave the object in an invalid state: public void SetAddress(string line1, string line2, string city, string state, int zip) { _shippingAddress.line1 = line1 ?? throw new ... _shippingAddress.line2 = line2; _shippingAddress.city = city ?? throw new ... _shippingAddress.state = (IsValid(state) ? state : throw new … ); }
