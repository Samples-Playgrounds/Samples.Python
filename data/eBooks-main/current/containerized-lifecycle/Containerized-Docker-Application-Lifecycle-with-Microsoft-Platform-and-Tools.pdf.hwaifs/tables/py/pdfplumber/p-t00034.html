      <td>Azure Service Fabric</td>
      <td>Service Fabric is a Microsoft microservices\nplatform for building applications. It’s an\norchestrator of services and creates\nclusters of machines. Service Fabric can\ndeploy services as containers or as plain\nprocesses. It can even mix services in\nprocesses with services in containers\nwithin the same application and cluster.\nService Fabric clusters can be deployed in\nAzure, on-premises or in any cloud.\nHowever, deployment in Azure is\nsimplified with a managed approach.\nService Fabric provides additional and\noptional prescriptive Service Fabric\nprogramming models like stateful services\nand Reliable Actors.\nService Fabric is mature in Windows (years\nevolving in Windows), less mature in Linux.\nBoth Linux and Windows containers are\nsupported in Service Fabric since 2017.</td>
