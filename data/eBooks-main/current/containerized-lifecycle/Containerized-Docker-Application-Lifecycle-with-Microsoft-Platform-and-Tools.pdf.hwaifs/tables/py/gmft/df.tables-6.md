|  0 | Service Fabric | Service Fabric is a Microsoft microservices                                                                           |
|  1 | nan            | platform for building applications. It’s an orchestrator of services and creates                                      |
|  2 | nan            | clusters of machines. Service Fabric can deploy services as containers or as plain                                    |
|  3 | nan            | processes. It can even mix services in                                                                                |
|  4 | nan            | processes with services in containers within the same application and cluster.                                        |
|  5 | nan            | Service Fabric clusters can be deployed in                                                                            |

|  8 | nan            | Service Fabric provides additional and optional prescriptive Service Fabric programming models like stateful services |

| 10 | nan            | Service Fabric is mature in Windows (years evolving in Windows), less mature in Linux.                                |
| 11 | nan            | Both Linux and Windows containers are supported in Service Fabric since 2017.                                         |
