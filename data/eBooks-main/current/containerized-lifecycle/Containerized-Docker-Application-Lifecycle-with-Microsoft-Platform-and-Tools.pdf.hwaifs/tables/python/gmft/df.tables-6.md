|  0 | Service Fabric | Service Fabric is a Microsoft microservices                                                                                                                                                              |
|  1 |                | platform for building applications. It’s an orchestrator of services and creates                                                                                                                         |
|  2 |                | clusters of machines. Service Fabric can deploy services as containers or as plain processes. It can even mix services in processes with services in containers within the same application and cluster. |
|  3 |                | Service Fabric clusters can be deployed in                                                                                                                                                               |

|  6 |                | programming models like stateful services and Reliable Actors.                                                                                                                                           |
|  7 |                | Service Fabric is mature in Windows (years evolving in Windows), less mature in Linux.                                                                                                                   |
|  8 |                | Both Linux and Windows containers are supported in Service Fabric since 2017.                                                                                                                            |
