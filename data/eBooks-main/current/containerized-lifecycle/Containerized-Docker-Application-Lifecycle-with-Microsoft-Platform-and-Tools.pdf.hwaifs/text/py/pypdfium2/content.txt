CHAPTER 1
Overview of Containers 
and Docker
Containerization is an approach to software development in which an application or service, its 
dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files) are packaged together as 
a container image. You then can test the containerized application as a unit and deploy it as a container 
image instance to the host operating system (OS).
Just as shipping containers allow goods to be transported by ship, train, or truck regardless of the 
cargo inside, software containers act as a standard unit of software deployment that can contain 
different code and dependencies. Containerizing software this way enables developers and IT 
professionals to deploy them across environments with little or no modification.
Containers also isolate applications from each other on a shared OS. Containerized applications run 
on top of a container host that in turn runs on the OS (Linux or Windows). Containers therefore have a 
much smaller footprint than virtual machine (VM) images.
Each container can run a whole web application or a service, as shown in Figure 1-1. In this example, 
Docker host is a container host, and App1, App2, Svc1, and Svc2 are containerized applications or 
services.
Figure 1-1. Multiple containers running on a container host
Another benefit you can derive from containerization is scalability. You can scale out quickly by 
creating new containers for short-term tasks. From an application point of view, instantiating an 
image (creating a container) is similar to instantiating a process like a service or web app. For 
reliability, however, when you run multiple instances of the same image across multiple host servers, 
you typically want each container (image instance) to run in a different host server or VM in different 
fault domains.
In short, containers offer the benefits of isolation, portability, agility, scalability, and control across the 
entire application lifecycle workflow. The most important benefit is the environment isolation 
provided between Dev and Ops.2 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker
Learn Docker
Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, selfsufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a company that 
promotes and evolves this technology, working in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows 
vendors, including Microsoft.
Figure 1-2. Docker deploys containers at all layers of the hybrid cloud
As shown in the above diagram, Docker containers can run anywhere, on-premises in the customer 
datacenter, in an external service provider or in the cloud, on Azure. Docker image containers can also 
run natively on Linux and Windows. However, Windows images can run only on Windows hosts and 
Linux images can run on Linux hosts and Windows hosts (using a Hyper-V Linux VM, so far), where 
host means a server or a VM.
Developers can use development environments on Windows, Linux, or macOS. On the development 
computer, the developer runs a Docker host where Docker images are deployed, including the app 
and its dependencies. Developers who work on Linux or on the Mac, use a Docker host that’s Linuxbased, and they can only create images for Linux containers. (Developers working on the Mac can edit 
code or run the Docker command-line interface (CLI) from macOS, but as of this writing, containers 
don’t run directly on macOS.) Developers who work on Windows can create images for either Linux or 
Windows Containers.
To host containers in development environments and provide additional developer tools, Docker 
ships Docker Desktop for Windows or for macOS. These products install the necessary VM (the Docker 
host) to host the containers.
To run Windows Containers, there are two types of runtimes:
• Windows Server Containers provide application isolation through process and namespace 
isolation technology. A Windows Server Container shares a kernel with the container host and 
with all containers running on the host.
• Hyper-V Containers expand on the isolation provided by Windows Server Containers by 
running each container in a highly optimized virtual machine. In this configuration, the kernel 
of the container host isn’t shared with the Hyper-V Containers, providing better isolation.3 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker
The images for these containers are created and work just the same way. The difference is in how the 
container is created from the image—running a Hyper-V Container requires an extra parameter. For 
details, see Hyper-V Containers.
Comparing Docker containers with virtual machines
Figure 1-3 shows a comparison between VMs and Docker containers.
Figure 1-3. Comparison of traditional virtual machines to Docker containers
As shown in the above diagram, for VMs, there are three base layers in the host server. From the 
bottom-up: Infrastructure, Host Operating System, and a Hypervisor. On top of all that, each VM has 
its own OS and all necessary libraries. On the other hand, for Docker, the host server only has the
Infrastructure and the OS. On top of that, the container engine keeps containers isolated, but lets 
them share the single base OS’s services.
Because containers require far fewer resources (for example, they don’t need a full OS), they’re easy to 
deploy and they start fast. This allows you to have higher density, meaning that it allows you to run 
more services on the same hardware unit, thereby reducing costs.
As a side effect of running on the same kernel, you get less isolation than VMs.
The main goal of an image is to ensure the same environment (dependencies) across different 
deployments. This means that you can debug it on your machine and then deploy it to another 
machine, the same environment guaranteed.
A container image is a way to package an app or service and deploy it in a reliable and reproducible 
way. You could say that Docker isn’t only a technology but also a philosophy and a process.4 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker
When using Docker, you won’t hear developers say, “It works on my machine, why not in production?” 
They can just say, “It runs on Docker”, because the packaged Docker application can be executed on 
any supported Docker environment, and it runs the way it was intended to on all deployment targets 
(such as Dev, QA, staging, and production).
A simple analogy
Perhaps a simple analogy can help getting the grasp of the core concept of Docker.
Let’s go back in time to the 1950s for a moment. There were no word processors, and the 
photocopiers were used everywhere (well, kind of).
Imagine you’re responsible for quickly issuing batches of letters as required, to mail them to 
customers, using real paper and envelopes, to be delivered physically to each customer’s address 
(there was no email back then).
At some point, you realize the letters are just a composition of a large set of paragraphs, which are 
picked and arranged as needed, according to the purpose of the letter, so you devise a system to 
issue letters quickly, expecting to get a hefty raise.
The system is simple:
1. You begin with a deck of transparent sheets containing one paragraph each.
2. To issue a set of letters, you pick the sheets with the paragraphs you need, then you stack and 
align them so they look and read fine.
3. Finally, you place the set in the photocopier and press start to produce as many letters as 
required.
So, simplifying, that’s the core idea of Docker.
In Docker, each layer is the resulting set of changes that happen to the filesystem after executing a 
command, such as, installing a program.
So, when you “look” at the filesystem after the layer has been copied, you see all the files, included the 
layer when the program was installed.
You can think of an image as an auxiliary read-only hard disk ready to be installed in a “computer” 
where the operating system is already installed.
Similarly, you can think of a container as the “computer” with the image hard disk installed. The 
container, just like a computer, can be powered on or off.
Learn Docker specific terminologies
This section lists terms and definitions you should be familiar with before getting deeper into Docker. 
For further definitions, see the extensive glossary provided by Docker.
Container image: A package with all the dependencies and information needed to create a container. 
An image includes all the dependencies (such as frameworks) plus deployment and execution 5 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker
configuration to be used by a container runtime. Usually, an image derives from multiple base images 
that are layers stacked on top of each other to form the container’s filesystem. An image is immutable 
once it has been created.
Dockerfile: A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It’s like a batch script, 
the first line states the base image to begin with and then follow the instructions to install required 
programs, copy files, and so on, until you get the working environment you need.
Build: The action of building a container image based on the information and context provided by its 
Dockerfile, plus additional files in the folder where the image is built. You can build images with the 
following Docker command:
docker build
Container: An instance of a Docker image. A container represents the execution of a single 
application, process, or service. It consists of the contents of a Docker image, an execution 
environment, and a standard set of instructions. When scaling a service, you create multiple instances 
of a container from the same image. Or a batch job can create multiple containers from the same 
image, passing different parameters to each instance.
Volumes: Offer a writable filesystem that the container can use. Since images are read-only but most 
programs need to write to the filesystem, volumes add a writable layer, on top of the container image, 
so the programs have access to a writable filesystem. The program doesn’t know it’s accessing a 
layered filesystem, it’s just the filesystem as usual. Volumes live in the host system and are managed 
by Docker.
Tag: A mark or label you can apply to images so that different images or versions of the same image 
(depending on the version number or the target environment) can be identified.
Multi-stage Build: Is a feature, since Docker 17.05 or higher, that helps to reduce the size of the final 
images. For example, a large base image, containing the SDK can be used for compiling and 
publishing and then a small runtime-only base image can be used to host the application.
Repository (repo): A collection of related Docker images, labeled with a tag that indicates the image 
version. Some repos contain multiple variants of a specific image, such as an image containing SDKs 
(heavier), an image containing only runtimes (lighter), etc. Those variants can be marked with tags. A 
single repo can contain platform variants, such as a Linux image and a Windows image.
Registry: A service that provides access to repositories. The default registry for most public images is 
Docker Hub (owned by Docker as an organization). A registry usually contains repositories from 
multiple teams. Companies often have private registries to store and manage images they’ve created. 
Azure Container Registry is another example.
Multi-arch image: For multi-architecture, it’s a feature that simplifies the selection of the appropriate 
image, according to the platform where Docker is running. For example, when a Dockerfile requests a 
base image FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 from the registry, it actually gets 6.0-
nanoserver-20H2, 6.0-nanoserver-1809 or 6.0-bullseye-slim, depending on the operating system 
and version where Docker is running.6 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker
Docker Hub: A public registry to upload images and work with them. Docker Hub provides Docker 
image hosting, public or private registries, build triggers and web hooks, and integration with GitHub 
and Bitbucket.
Azure Container Registry: A public resource for working with Docker images and its components in 
Azure. This provides a registry that’s close to your deployments in Azure and that gives you control 
over access, making it possible to use your Azure Active Directory groups and permissions.
Docker Trusted Registry (DTR): A Docker registry service (from Docker) that can be installed onpremises so it lives within the organization’s datacenter and network. It’s convenient for private 
images that should be managed within the enterprise. Docker Trusted Registry is included as part of 
the Docker Datacenter product.
Docker Desktop: Development tools for Windows and macOS for building, running, and testing 
containers locally. Docker Desktop for Windows provides development environments for both Linux 
and Windows Containers. The Linux Docker host on Windows is based on a Hyper-V virtual machine. 
The host for Windows Containers is directly based on Windows. Docker Desktop for Mac is based on 
the Apple Hypervisor framework and the xhyve hypervisor, which provides a Linux Docker host virtual 
machine on macOS. Docker Desktop for Windows and for Mac replaces Docker Toolbox, which was 
based on Oracle VirtualBox.
Compose: A command-line tool and YAML file format with metadata for defining and running multicontainer applications. You define a single application based on multiple images with one or more 
.yml files that can override values depending on the environment. After you’ve created the definitions, 
you can deploy the whole multi-container application with a single command (docker-compose up) 
that creates a container per image on the Docker host.
Cluster: A collection of Docker hosts exposed as if it were a single virtual Docker host, so that the 
application can scale to multiple instances of the services spread across multiple hosts within the 
cluster. Docker clusters can be created with Kubernetes, Azure Service Fabric, Docker Swarm and 
Mesosphere DC/OS.
Orchestrator: A tool that simplifies the management of clusters and Docker hosts. Orchestrators 
enable you to manage their images, containers, and hosts through a command-line interface (CLI) or a 
graphical UI. You can manage container networking, configurations, load balancing, service discovery, 
high availability, Docker host configuration, and more. An orchestrator is responsible for running, 
distributing, scaling, and healing workloads across a collection of nodes. Typically, orchestrator 
products are the same products that provide cluster infrastructure, like Kubernetes and Azure Service 
Fabric, among other offerings in the market.
Learn docker containers, images, and registries
When using Docker, you create an app or service and package it and its dependencies into a 
container image. An image is a static representation of the app or service and its configuration and 
dependencies.
To run the app or service, the app’s image is instantiated to create a container, which will be running 
on the Docker host. Containers are initially tested in a development environment or PC.7 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker
You store images in a registry that acts as a library of images. You need a registry when deploying to 
production orchestrators. Docker maintains a public registry via Docker Hub; other vendors provide 
registries for different collections of images, including Azure Container Registry. Alternatively, 
enterprises can have a private registry on-premises for their own Docker images.
Figure 1-4 shows how images and registries in Docker relate to other components. It also shows the 
multiple registry offerings from vendors.
Figure 1-4. Taxonomy of Docker terms and concepts
The registry is like a bookshelf where images are stored and available to be pulled for building 
containers to run services or web apps. There are private Docker registries on-premises and on the 
public cloud. Docker Hub is a public registry maintained by Docker, along the Docker Trusted Registry 
an enterprise-grade solution, Azure offers the Azure Container Registry. AWS, Google and others also 
have container registries.
By putting images in a registry, you can store static and immutable application bits, including all 
of their dependencies, at a framework level. You then can version and deploy images in multiple 
environments and thus provide a consistent deployment unit.8 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker
Private image registries, either hosted on-premises or in the cloud, are recommended when:
• Your images must not be shared publicly due to confidentiality.
• You want to have minimum network latency between your images and your chosen 
deployment environment. For example, if your production environment is Azure, you probably 
want to store your images in Azure Container Registry so that network latency is minimal. In a 
similar way, if your production environment is on-premises, you might want to have an onpremises Docker Trusted Registry available within the same local network.
Road to modern applications based on containers
You’re probably reading this book because you’re planning the development of new applications or 
you’re assessing the impact of using Docker, Containers, and new approaches like Microservices in 
your company.
The adoption of new development paradigms must be taken with caution before starting a project, to 
assess the impact on your dev teams, your budget, or your infrastructure.
Microsoft has been working on rich guidance, sample applications, and a suite of e-books that can 
help you make an informed decision and guide your team through a successful development, 
deployment, and operations of your new applications.
This book belongs to a Microsoft suite of guides that cover many of the needs and challenges you’ll 
face during the process of developing new modern applications based on containers.
You can find additional Microsoft e-books related to Docker containers in the list below:
• .NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications
https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/microservices/
• Modernize existing .NET applications with Azure cloud and Windows Containers
https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/modernize-with-azure-containers/9 CHAPTER 2 | Introduction to the Docker application life cycle
CHAPTER 2
Introduction to the Docker 
application life cycle
The life cycle of containerized applications is a journey that begins with the developer. The developer 
chooses to implement containers and Docker because it eliminates frictions in deployments and IT 
operations, which ultimately helps everyone to be more agile, more productive end-to-end, and faster.
Containers as the foundation for DevOps 
collaboration
By the very nature of the containers and Docker technology, developers can share their software and 
dependencies easily with IT operations and production environments while eliminating the typical “it 
works on my machine” excuse. Containers solve application conflicts between different environments. 
Indirectly, containers and Docker bring developers and IT operations closer together, making it easier 
for them to collaborate effectively. Adopting the container workflow provides many customers 
with the DevOps continuity they’ve sought but previously had to implement via more complex 
configuration for release and build pipelines. Containers simplify the build/test/deploy pipelines 
in DevOps.
Figure 2-1. Main workloads per “personas” in the life cycle for containerized Docker applications
With Docker containers, developers own what’s within the container (application and service, and 
dependencies to frameworks and components) and how the containers and services behave together 
as an application composed by a collection of services. The interdependencies of the multiple 
containers are defined in a docker-compose.yml file, or what could be called a deployment manifest. 
Meanwhile, IT operations teams (IT professionals and management) can focus on the management 10 CHAPTER 2 | Introduction to the Docker application life cycle
of production environments; infrastructure; scalability; monitoring; and, ultimately, ensuring that the 
applications are delivering properly for the end users, without having to know the contents of the 
various containers. Hence, the name “container,” recalling the analogy to real-world shipping 
containers. Thus, the owners of a container’s content need not concern themselves with how the 
container will be shipped, and the shipping company transports a container from its point of origin 
to its destination without knowing or caring about the contents. In a similar manner, developers can 
create and own the contents within a Docker container without the need to concern themselves with 
the “transport” mechanisms.
In the pillar on the left side of Figure 2-1, developers write and run code locally in Docker containers 
by using Docker for Windows or Mac. They define the operating environment for the code by using a 
Dockerfile that specifies the base operating system to run as well as the build steps for building their 
code into a Docker image. The developers define how one or more images will interoperate using the 
aforementioned docker-compose.yml file deployment manifest. As they complete their local 
development, they push their application code plus the Docker configuration files to the code 
repository of their choice (that is, Git repository).
The DevOps pillar defines the build–Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines using the Dockerfile 
provided in the code repository. The CI system pulls the base container images from the selected 
Docker registry and builds the custom Docker images for the application. The images then are 
validated and pushed to the Docker registry used for the deployments to multiple environments.
In the pillar on the right, operations teams manage deployed applications and infrastructure in 
production while monitoring the environment and applications so that they can provide feedback and 
insights to the development team about how the application might be improved. Container apps are 
typically run in production using container orchestrators like Kubernetes, where usually Helm charts
are used to configure deployment units, instead of docker-compose files.
The two teams are collaborating through a foundational platform (Docker containers) that provides 
a separation of concerns as a contract, while greatly improving the two teams’ collaboration in the 
application life cycle. The developers own the container contents, its operating environment, and the 
container interdependencies, whereas the operations teams take the built images along with the 
manifest and runs them in their orchestration system.
Challenges in the application life cycle when using Docker.
There are many reasons that will increase the number of containerized applications in the upcoming 
years, and one of these reasons is the creation of applications based on microservices.
During the last 15 years, the use of web services has been the base of thousands of applications, and 
probably, after a few years, you’ll find the same situation with microservice-based applications 
running on Docker containers.
It is also worth to mention that you can also use Docker containers for monolithic applications and 
you still get most of the benefits of Docker. Containers are not targeting only microservices.
The use of Docker containerization and microservices causes new challenges in the development 
process of your organizations and therefore, you need a solid strategy to maintain many containers 11 CHAPTER 2 | Introduction to the Docker application life cycle
and microservices running on production systems. Eventually, enterprise applications will have 
hundreds or thousands of containers/instances running in production.
These challenges create new demands when using DevOps tools, so you’ll have to define new 
processes in your DevOps activities, and find answers for the following type of questions:
• Which tools can I use for development, CI/CD, management and operations??
• How can my company manage errors in containers when running in production?
• How can we change pieces of our software in production with minimum downtime?
• How can we scale and monitor our production system?
• How can we include the testing and deployment of containers in our release pipeline?
• How can we use Open Source tools/platforms for containers in Microsoft Azure?
If you can answer all those questions, you’ll be better prepared to move your applications (existing or 
new apps) to Docker containers.
Introduction to a generic end-to-end Docker application life cycle 
workflow
Figure 2-2 presents a more detailed workflow for a Docker application life cycle, focusing in this 
instance on specific DevOps activities and assets.
Figure 2-2. High-level workflow for the Docker containerized application life cycle
Everything begins with the developer, who starts writing code in the inner-loop workflow. The innerloop stage is where developers define everything that happens before pushing code into the code 
repository (for example, a source control system such as Git). After it’s committed, the repository 
triggers Continuous Integration (CI) and the rest of the workflow.12 CHAPTER 2 | Introduction to the Docker application life cycle
The inner loop consists of typical steps like “code,” “run,” “test,” and “debug,” plus the additional steps 
needed right before running the app locally. This is the developer’s process to run and test the app as 
a Docker container. The inner-loop workflow will be explained in the sections that follow.
Taking a step back to look at the end-to-end workflow, the DevOps workflow is more than a 
technology or a tool set, it’s a mindset that requires cultural evolution. It’s people, processes, and the 
appropriate tools to make your application life cycle faster and more predictable. Enterprises that 
adopt a containerized workflow typically restructure their organizations to represent people and 
processes that match the containerized workflow.
Practicing DevOps can help teams respond faster together to competitive pressures by replacing 
error-prone manual processes with automation, which results in improved traceability and repeatable 
workflows. Organizations also can manage environments more efficiently and realize cost savings with 
a combination of on-premises and cloud resources as well as tightly integrated tooling.
When implementing your DevOps workflow for Docker applications, you’ll see that Docker 
technologies are present in almost every stage of the workflow, from your development box while 
working in the inner loop (code, run, debug), the build-test-CI phase, and, finally, the deployment of 
those containers to the staging and production environments.
Improvement of quality practices helps to identify defects early in the development cycle, which 
reduces the cost of fixing them. By including the environment and dependencies in the image and 
adopting a philosophy of deploying the same image across multiple environments, you promote a 
discipline of extracting the environment-specific configurations making deployments more reliable.
Rich data obtained through effective instrumentation (monitoring and diagnostics) provides insight 
into performance issues and user behavior to guide future priorities and investments.
DevOps should be considered a journey, not a destination. It should be implemented incrementally 
through appropriately scoped projects from which you can demonstrate success, learn, and evolve.
Benefits of DevOps for containerized applications
Here are some of the most important benefits provided by a solid DevOps workflow:
• Deliver better-quality software, faster and with better compliance.
• Drive continuous improvement and adjustments earlier and more economically.
• Increase transparency and collaboration among stakeholders involved in delivering and 
operating software.
• Control costs and utilize provisioned resources more effectively while minimizing security 
risks.
• Plug and play well with many of your existing DevOps investments, including investments in 
open-source.13 CHAPTER 3 | Introduction to the Microsoft platform and tools for containerized apps

Microsoft platform 
and tools for containerized 
apps
Vision: Create an adaptable, enterprise-grade, containerized application life cycle that spans your 
development, IT operations, and production management.
Figure 3-1 shows the main pillars in the life cycle of Docker apps classified by the type of work 
delivered by multiple teams (app-development, DevOps infrastructure processes, and IT management 
and operations). Usually, in the enterprise, the profiles of “the persona” responsible for each area are 
different. So are their skills.14 CHAPTER 3 | Introduction to the Microsoft platform and tools for containerized apps
Figure 3-1. Main pillars in the life cycle for containerized Docker applications with Microsoft platform and tools
A containerized Docker life-cycle workflow can be initially prescriptive based on “by-default product 
choices,” making it easier for developers to get started faster, but it’s fundamental that under the 
hood there must be an open framework so that it will be a flexible workflow capable of adjusting to 
the different contexts from each organization or enterprise. The workflow infrastructure (components 
and products) must be flexible enough to cover the environment that each company will have in the 
future, even being capable of swapping development or DevOps products to others. This flexibility, 
openness, and the broad choice of technologies in the platform and infrastructure are precisely the 
Microsoft priorities for containerized Docker applications, as explained in the chapters that follow.
Table 3-1 demonstrates that the intention of the Azure DevOps for containerized Docker applications 
is to provide an open DevOps workflow so that you can choose what products to use for each phase 
(Microsoft or third-party) while providing a simplified workflow that provides “by-default-products” 
already connected; thus, you can quickly get started with your enterprise-level DevOps workflow for 
Docker apps.

The Microsoft platform and tools for containerized Docker apps, as defined in Table 3-1, comprise the 
following components:
• Platform for Docker Apps development The development of a service, or collection of 
services that make up an “app.” The development platform provides all the work developers 
requires prior to pushing their code to a shared code repository. Developing services, 
deployed as containers, are similar to the development of the same apps or services without 
Docker. You continue to use your preferred language (.NET, Node.js, Go, etc.) and preferred 
editor or IDE like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. However, rather than consider Docker a 
deployment destination, you develop your services in the Docker environment. You build, run, 
test, and debug your code in containers locally, providing the destination environment at 
development time. By providing the destination environment locally, Docker containers set up 
what will drastically help you improve your DevOps life cycle. Visual Studio and Visual Studio 
Code have extensions to integrate Docker containers within your development process.
• DevOps for Docker Apps Developers creating Docker applications can use Azure DevOps, 
GitHub or any other third-party product, like Jenkins, to build out a comprehensive 
automated application life-cycle management (ALM).
With Azure DevOps and/or GitHub, developers can create container-focused DevOps for a 
fast, iterative process that covers source-code control from anywhere (Azure DevOps-Git, 
GitHub, any remote Git repository, or Subversion), Continuous Integration (CI), internal unit 
tests, inter-container/service integration tests, Continuous Delivery (CD), and release 
management (RM). Developers also can automate their Docker application releases into Azure 
Kubernetes Service (AKS), from development to staging and production environments.
• Management and Monitoring IT can manage and monitor production applications and 
services in several ways, integrating both perspectives in a consolidated experience.
– Azure portal Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) helps you to set up and maintain your 
Docker environments. You can also use other orchestrators to visualize and configure 
your cluster.
– Docker tools You can manage your container applications using familiar tools. 
There’s no need to change your existing Docker management practices to move 
container workloads to the cloud. Use the application management tools you’re 16 CHAPTER 3 | Introduction to the Microsoft platform and tools for containerized apps
already familiar with and connect via the standard API endpoints for the orchestrator 
of your choice. You also can use other third-party tools to manage your Docker 
applications or even CLI Docker tools.
Even if you’re familiar with Linux commands, you can manage your container 
applications using Microsoft Windows and PowerShell with a Linux Subsystem 
command line and the products (Docker, Kubernetes…) clients running on this Linux 
Subsystem capability. You’ll learn more about using these tools under Linux 
Subsystem using your favorite Microsoft Windows OS later in this book.
– Open-source tools Because AKS exposes the standard API endpoints for the 
orchestration engine, the most popular tools are compatible with AKS and, in most 
cases, will work out of the box—including visualizers, monitoring, command-line 
tools, and even future tools as they become available.
– GitHub Advanced Security GitHub Advanced Security offers a suite of tools for 
securing the software supply chain that can seamlessly integrate security into the 
daily workflow of teams developing containerized applications.
– Azure Monitor Is Azure’s solution to monitor every angle of your production 
environment. You can monitor production Docker applications by just setting up its 
SDK into your services so that you can get system-generated log data from the 
applications.
Thus, Microsoft offers a complete foundation for an end-to-end containerized Docker application life 
cycle. However, it’s a collection of products and technologies that allow you to optionally select and 
integrate with existing tools and processes. The flexibility in a broad approach along with the strength 
in the depth of capabilities place Microsoft in a strong position for containerized Docker application 
development.17 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure

Azure
Vision: Design and develop scalable solutions with Docker in mind.
There are many great-fit use cases for containers, not just for microservices-oriented architectures, but 
also when you simply have regular services or web applications to run and you want to reduce frictions 
between development and production environment deployments.
Design Docker applications
Chapter 1 introduced the fundamental concepts regarding containers and Docker. That information is 
the basic level of information you need to get started. But, enterprise applications can be complex and 
composed of multiple services instead of a single service or container. For those optional use cases, 
you need to know additional approaches to design, such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and 
the more advanced microservices concepts and container orchestration concepts. The scope of this 
document is not limited to microservices but to any Docker application life cycle, therefore, it does 
not explore microservices architecture in depth because you can also use containers and Docker with 
regular SOA, background tasks or jobs, or even with monolithic application deployment approaches.
More info To learn more about enterprise applications and microservices architecture in depth, read 
the guide NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications that you can also 
download from https://aka.ms/MicroservicesEbook.
However, before you get into the application life cycle and DevOps, it’s important to know how you’re 
going to design and construct your application and what are your design choices.18 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Common container design principles
Ahead of getting into the development process there are a few basic concepts worth mentioning with 
regard to how you use containers.
Container equals a process
In the container model, a container represents a single process. By defining a container as a process 
boundary, you begin to create the primitives used to scale, or batch-off, processes. When you run a 
Docker container, you’ll see an ENTRYPOINT definition. This defines the process and the lifetime of 
the container. When the process completes, the container life-cycle ends. There are long-running 
processes, such as web servers, and short-lived processes, such as batch jobs, which might have 
been implemented as Microsoft Azure WebJobs. If the process fails, the container ends, and the 
orchestrator takes over. If the orchestrator was instructed to keep five instances running and one fails, 
the orchestrator will create another container to replace the failed process. In a batch job, the process 
is started with parameters. When the process completes, the work is complete.
You might find a scenario in which you want multiple processes running in a single container. In any 
architecture document, there’s never a “never,” nor is there always an “always.” For scenarios requiring 
multiple processes, a common pattern is to use Supervisor.
Monolithic applications
In this scenario, you’re building a single and monolithic web application or service and deploying it as 
a container. Within the application, the structure might not be monolithic; it might comprise several 
libraries, components, or even layers (application layer, domain layer, data access layer, etc.). 
Externally, it’s a single container, like a single process, single web application, or single service.
To manage this model, you deploy a single container to represent the application. To scale it, just add 
a few more copies with a load balancer in front. The simplicity comes from managing a single 
deployment in a single container or virtual machine (VM).
Following the principal that a container does one thing only, and does it in one process, the 
monolithic pattern is in conflict. You can include multiple components/libraries or internal layers 
within each container, as illustrated in Figure 4-1.19 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-1. An example of monolithic application architecture
A monolithic app has all or most of its functionality within a single process or container and it’s 
componentized in internal layers or libraries. The downside to this approach comes if or when the 
application grows, requiring it to scale. If the entire application scaled, it’s not really a problem. 
However, in most cases, a few parts of the application are the choke points that require scaling, 
whereas other components are used less.
Using the typical e-commerce example, what you likely need is to scale the product information 
component. Many more customers browse products than purchase them. More customers use their 
basket than use the payment pipeline. Fewer customers add comments or view their purchase history. 
And you likely have only a handful of employees, in a single region, that need to manage the content 
and marketing campaigns. By scaling the monolithic design, all of the code is deployed multiple times.
In addition to the “scale-everything” problem, changes to a single component require complete 
retesting of the entire application as well as a complete redeployment of all the instances.
The monolithic approach is common, and many organizations are developing with this architectural 
method. Many enjoy good enough results, whereas others encounter limits. Many designed their 
applications in this model because the tools and infrastructure were too difficult to build SOAs, and 
they didn’t see the need—until the app grew.
From an infrastructure perspective, each server can run many applications within the same host and 
have an acceptable ratio of efficiency in your resources usage, as shown in Figure 4-2.20 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-2. A host running multiple apps/containers
Finally, from an availability perspective, monolithic applications must be deployed as a whole; that 
means that in case you must stop and start, all functionality and all users will be affected during the 
deployment window. In certain situations, the use of Azure and containers can minimize these 
situations and reduce the probability of downtime of your application, as you can see in Figure 4-3.
You can deploy monolithic applications in Azure by using dedicated VMs for each instance. Using 
Azure VM Scale Sets, you can scale the VMs easily.
You can also use Azure App Services to run monolithic applications and easily scale instances without 
having to manage the VMs. Azure App Services can run single instances of Docker containers, as well, 
simplifying the deployment.
You can deploy multiple VMs as Docker hosts and run any number of containers per VM. Then, by 
using an Azure Load Balancer, as illustrated in the Figure 4-3, you can manage scaling.
Figure 4-3. Multiple hosts scaling out a single Docker application
You can manage the deployment of the hosts themselves via traditional deployment techniques.
You can manage Docker containers from the command line by using commands like docker run and 
docker-compose up, and you can also automate it in Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines and deploy 
to Docker hosts from Azure DevOps Services, for instance.21 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Monolithic application deployed as a container
There are benefits to using containers to manage monolithic deployments. Scaling the instances of 
containers is far faster and easier than deploying additional VMs.
Deploying updates as Docker images is far faster and network efficient. Docker containers typically 
start in seconds, speeding rollouts. Tearing down a Docker container is as easy as invoking the docker 
stop command, typically completing in less than a second.
Because containers are inherently immutable, by design, you never need to worry about corrupted 
VMs because an update script forgot to account for some specific configuration or file left on disk.
Although monolithic apps can benefit from Docker, we’re touching on only the tips of the benefits. 
The larger benefits of managing containers come from deploying with container orchestrators that 
manage the various instances and life cycle of each container instance. Breaking up the monolithic 
application into subsystems that can be scaled, developed, and deployed individually is your entry 
point into the realm of microservices.
To learn about how to “lift and shift” monolithic applications with containers and how you can 
modernize your applications, you can read this additional Microsoft guide, Modernize existing .NET 
applications with Azure cloud and Windows Containers, which you can also download as PDF from 
https://aka.ms/LiftAndShiftWithContainersEbook.
Publish a single Docker container app to Azure App Service
Either because you want to get a quick validation of a container deployed to Azure or because the 
app is simply a single-container app, Azure App Services provides a great way to provide scalable 
single-container services.
Using Azure App Service is intuitive and you can get up and running quickly because it provides great 
Git integration to take your code, build it in Microsoft Visual Studio, and directly deploy it to Azure. 
But, traditionally (with no Docker), if you needed other capabilities, frameworks, or dependencies that 
aren’t supported in App Services, you needed to wait for it until the Azure team updates those 
dependencies in App Service or switched to other services like Service Fabric, Cloud Services, or even 
plain VMs, for which you have further control and can install a required component or framework for 
your application.
Now, as shown in Figure 4-4, when using Visual Studio 2022, container support in Azure App Service 
gives you the ability to include whatever you want in your app environment. If you added a 
dependency to your app, because you’re running it in a container, you get the capability of including 
those dependencies in your Dockerfile or Docker image.22 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-4. Publishing a container to Azure App Service from Visual Studio apps/containers
Figure 4-4 also shows that the publish flow pushes an image through a Container Registry, which can 
be the Azure Container Registry (a registry near to your deployments in Azure and secured by Azure 
Active Directory groups and accounts) or any other Docker Registry like Docker Hub or on-premises 
registries.
State and data in Docker applications
In most cases, you can think of a container as an instance of a process. A process does not maintain 
persistent state. While a container can write to its local storage, assuming that an instance will be 
around indefinitely is like assuming that a single location in memory will be durable. Container 
images, like processes, should be assumed to have multiple instances and that they will eventually be 
killed; if they’re managed with a container orchestrator, it should be assumed that they might get 
moved from one node or VM to another.
The following solutions are used to manage persistent data in Docker applications:
From the Docker host, as Docker Volumes:
• Volumes are stored in an area of the host filesystem that’s managed by Docker.
• Bind mounts can map to any folder in the host filesystem, so access can’t be controlled from 
a Docker process and can pose a security risk as a container could access sensitive OS folders.23 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
• tmpfs mounts are like virtual folders that only exist in the host’s memory and are never 
written to the filesystem.
From remote storage:
• Azure Storage provides geo-distributable storage, providing a good long-term persistence 
solution for containers.
• Remote relational databases like Azure SQL Database, NoSQL databases like Azure Cosmos 
DB, or cache services like Redis.
From the Docker container:
• Docker provides a feature named the overlay file system. This feature implements a copy-onwrite task that stores updated information to the root file system of the container. That 
information “lays on top of” the original image on which the container is based. If the 
container is deleted from the system, those changes are lost. Therefore, while it’s possible to 
save the state of a container within its local storage, designing a system based on this feature 
would conflict with the premise of container design, which by default is stateless.
• However, Docker Volumes is now the preferred way to handle local data in Docker. If you 
need more information about storage in containers, check on Docker storage drivers and 
About images, containers, and storage drivers.
The following provides additional detail about these options.
Volumes are directories mapped from the host OS to directories in containers. When code in the 
container has access to the directory, that access is actually to a directory on the host OS. This 
directory is not tied to the lifetime of the container itself, and the directory is managed by Docker and 
isolated from the core functionality of the host machine. Thus, data volumes are designed to persist 
data independently of the life of the container. If you delete a container or an image from the Docker 
host, the data persisted in the data volume is not deleted.
Volumes can be named or anonymous (the default). Named volumes are the evolution of Data 
Volume Containers and make it easy to share data between containers. Volumes also support 
volume drivers that allow you to store data on remote hosts, among other options.
Bind mounts have been available for a long time and allow the mapping of any folder to a mount 
point in a container. Bind mounts have more limitations than volumes and some important security 
issues, so volumes are the recommended option.
tmpfs mounts are virtual folders that live only in the host’s memory and are never written to the 
filesystem. They are fast and secure but use memory and are only meant for non-persistent data.
As shown in Figure 4-5, regular Docker volumes can be stored outside of the containers themselves 
but within the physical boundaries of the host server or VM. However, Docker containers cannot 
access a volume from one host server or VM to another. In other words, with these volumes, it isn’t 
possible to manage data shared between containers that run on different Docker hosts, although it 
could be achieved with a volume driver that supports remote hosts.24 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-5. Volumes and external data sources for container-based applications
In addition, when Docker containers are managed by an orchestrator, containers might “move” 
between hosts, depending on the optimizations performed by the cluster. Therefore, it isn’t 
recommended that you use data volumes for business data. But they are a good mechanism to work 
with trace files, temporal files, or similar, that will not impact business data consistency.
Remote data sources and cache tools like Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, or a remote cache 
like Redis can be used in containerized applications the same way they are used when developing 
without containers. This is a proven way to store business application data.
Azure Storage. Business data usually needs to be placed in external resources or databases, like 
Azure Storage. Azure Storage provides the following services in the cloud:
• Blob storage stores unstructured object data. A blob can be any type of text or binary data, 
such as document or media files (images, audio, and video files). Blob storage is also referred 
to as Object storage.
• File storage offers shared storage for legacy applications using the standard SMB protocol. 
Azure virtual machines and cloud services can share file data across application components 
via mounted shares. On-premises applications can access file data in a share via the File 
Service REST API.
• Table storage stores structured datasets. Table storage is a NoSQL key-attribute data store, 
which allows rapid development and fast access to large quantities of data.
Relational databases and NoSQL databases. There are many choices for external databases, from 
relational databases like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or NoSQL databases like Azure Cosmos DB, 
MongoDB, etc. These databases are not going to be explained as part of this guide since they are a 
different topic altogether.25 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Service-oriented applications
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) was an overused term that meant many different things to 
different people. But as a common denominator, SOA means that you structure the architecture of 
your application by decomposing it into several services (most commonly as HTTP services) that can 
be classified in different types like subsystems or, in other cases, as tiers.
Today, you can deploy those services as Docker containers, which solve deployment-related issues 
because all of the dependencies are included in the container image. However, when you need to 
scale out SOAs, you might encounter challenges if you’re deploying based on single instances. This 
challenge can be handled using Docker clustering software or an orchestrator. You’ll get to look at 
orchestrators in greater detail in the next section, when you explore microservices approaches.
Docker containers are useful (but not required) for both traditional service-oriented architectures and 
the more advanced microservices architectures.
At the end of the day, the container clustering solutions are useful for both a traditional SOA 
architecture and for a more advanced microservices architecture in which each microservice owns its 
data model. And thanks to multiple databases, you can also scale out the data tier instead of working 
with monolithic databases shared by the SOA services. However, the discussion about splitting the 
data is purely about architecture and design.
Orchestrating microservices and multi-container 
applications for high scalability and availability
Using orchestrators for production-ready applications is essential if your application is based on 
microservices or split across multiple containers. As introduced previously, in a microservice-based 
approach, each microservice owns its model and data so that it will be autonomous from a 
development and deployment point of view. But even if you have a more traditional application that’s 
composed of multiple services (like SOA), you’ll also have multiple containers or services comprising a 
single business application that need to be deployed as a distributed system. These kinds of systems 
are complex to scale out and manage; therefore, you absolutely need an orchestrator if you want to 
have a production-ready and scalable multi-container application.
Figure 4-6 illustrates deployment into a cluster of an application composed of multiple microservices 
(containers).26 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-6. A cluster of containers
It looks like a logical approach. But how are you handling load balancing, routing, and orchestrating 
these composed applications?
The Docker CLI meets the needs of managing one container on one host, but it falls short when it 
comes to managing multiple containers deployed on multiple hosts for more complex distributed 
applications. In most cases, you need a management platform that will automatically start containers, 
scale out containers with multiple instances per image, suspend them, or shut them down when 
needed, and ideally also control how they access resources like the network and data storage.
To go beyond the management of individual containers or simple composed apps and move toward 
larger enterprise applications with microservices, you must turn to orchestration and clustering 
platforms.
From an architecture and development point of view, if you’re building large, enterprise, 
microservices-based, applications, it’s important to understand the following platforms and products 
that support advanced scenarios:
• Clusters and orchestrators. When you need to scale out applications across many Docker 
hosts, such as with a large microservices-based application, it’s critical to be able to manage 
all of those hosts as a single cluster by abstracting the complexity of the underlying platform. 
That’s what the container clusters and orchestrators provide. Examples of orchestrators are 
Azure Service Fabric and Kubernetes. Kubernetes is available in Azure through Azure 
Kubernetes Service.27 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
• Schedulers. Scheduling means to have the capability for an administrator to launch containers 
in a cluster, so schedulers also provide a user interface for doing so. A cluster scheduler has 
several responsibilities: to use the cluster’s resources efficiently, to set the constraints 
provided by the user, to efficiently load-balance containers across nodes or hosts, and to be 
robust against errors while providing high availability.
The concepts of a cluster and a scheduler are closely related, so the products provided by different 
vendors often provide both sets of capabilities. The section below shows the most important platform 
and software choices you have for clusters and schedulers. These orchestrators are widely offered in 
public clouds like Azure.

Platform Comments
Azure Service Fabric Service Fabric is a Microsoft microservices 
platform for building applications. It’s an 
orchestrator of services and creates 
clusters of machines. Service Fabric can 
deploy services as containers or as plain 
processes. It can even mix services in 
processes with services in containers 
within the same application and cluster.
Service Fabric clusters can be deployed in 
Azure, on-premises or in any cloud. 
However, deployment in Azure is 
simplified with a managed approach.
Service Fabric provides additional and 
optional prescriptive Service Fabric 
programming models like stateful services
and Reliable Actors.
Service Fabric is mature in Windows (years 
evolving in Windows), less mature in Linux.
Both Linux and Windows containers are 
supported in Service Fabric since 2017.
Azure Service Fabric Mesh | Azure Service Fabric Mesh offers the same reliability, missioncritical performance and scale as Service Fabric, but also offers a fully managed and serverless 
platform. You don’t need to manage a cluster, VMs, storage or networking configuration. You just 
focus on your application’s development. Service Fabric Mesh supports both Windows and Linux 
containers, allowing you to develop with any programming language and framework of your choice.

Using container-based orchestrators in Azure
Several cloud vendors offer Docker containers support plus Docker clusters and orchestration support, 
including Azure, Amazon EC2 Container Service, and Google Container Engine. Azure provides Docker 29 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
cluster and orchestrator support through Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Service Fabric, and 
Azure Service Fabric Mesh.
Using Azure Kubernetes Service
A Kubernetes cluster pools several Docker hosts and exposes them as a single virtual Docker host, so 
you can deploy multiple containers into the cluster and scale-out with any number of container 
instances. The cluster will handle all the complex management plumbing, like scalability, health, and 
so forth.
AKS provides a way to simplify the creation, configuration, and management of a cluster of virtual 
machines in Azure that are preconfigured to run containerized applications. Using an optimized 
configuration of popular open-source scheduling and orchestration tools, AKS enables you to use 
your existing skills or draw on a large and growing body of community expertise to deploy and 
manage container-based applications on Microsoft Azure.
Azure Kubernetes Service optimizes the configuration of popular Docker clustering open-source tools 
and technologies specifically for Azure. You get an open solution that offers portability for both your 
containers and your application configuration. You select the size, the number of hosts, and the 
orchestrator tools, and AKS handles everything else.30 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-7. Kubernetes cluster’s simplified structure and topology
Figure 4-7 shows the structure of a Kubernetes cluster where a master node (VM) controls most of the 
coordination of the cluster, and you can deploy containers to the rest of the nodes that are managed 
as a single pool from an application point of view. This allows you to scale to thousands or even tens 
of thousands of containers.
Development environment for Kubernetes
In the development environment that Docker announced in July 2018, Kubernetes can also run in a 
single development machine (Windows 10 or macOS) by just installing Docker Desktop. You can later 
deploy to the cloud (AKS) for further integration tests, as shown in figure 4-8.31 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-8. Running Kubernetes in dev machine and the cloud
Get started with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
To begin using AKS, you deploy an AKS cluster from the Azure portal or by using the CLI. For more 
information on deploying a Kubernetes cluster to Azure, see Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service 
(AKS) cluster.
There are no fees for any of the software installed by default as part of AKS. All default options are 
implemented with open-source software. AKS is available for multiple virtual machines in Azure. 
You’re charged only for the compute instances you choose, as well as the other underlying 
infrastructure resources consumed, such as storage and networking. There are no incremental charges 
for AKS itself.
For further implementation information on deployment to Kubernetes based on kubectl and original 
.yaml files, see Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Deploy with Helm charts into Kubernetes clusters
When deploying an application to a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the original kubectl.exe CLI tool 
using deployment files based on the native format (.yaml files), as already mentioned in the previous 
section. However, for more complex Kubernetes applications such as when deploying complex 
microservice-based applications, it’s recommended to use Helm.
Helm Charts helps you define, version, install, share, upgrade, or rollback even the most complex 
Kubernetes application. Helm is maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in 
collaboration with Microsoft, Google, Bitnami, and the Helm contributor community.
For further implementation information on Helm charts and Kubernetes, see the section called Install 
eShopOnContainers using Helm.32 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure

Using Azure Service Fabric
Azure Service Fabric arose from Microsoft’s transition from delivering “box” products, which were 
typically monolithic in style, to delivering services. The experience of building and operating large 
services at scale, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, or Cortana’s 
Backend, shaped Service Fabric. The platform evolved over time as more and more services adopted 
it. Importantly, Service Fabric had to run not only in Azure but also in standalone Windows Server 
deployments.
The aim of Service Fabric is to solve the hard problems of building and running a service and utilizing 
infrastructure resources efficiently, so that teams can solve business problems using a microservices 
approach.
Service Fabric provides two broad areas to help you build applications that use a microservices 
approach:
• A platform that provides system services to deploy, scale, upgrade, detect, and restart failed 
services, discover service location, manage state, and monitor health. These system services in 
effect enable many of the characteristics of microservices described previously.
• Programming APIs, or frameworks, to help you build applications as microservices: reliable 
actors and reliable services. You can choose any code to build your microservice, but these 
APIs make the job more straightforward, and they integrate with the platform at a deeper 
level. This way you can get health and diagnostics information, or you can take advantage of 
reliable state management.
Service Fabric is agnostic with respect to how you build your service, and you can use any technology. 
However, it provides built-in programming APIs that make it easier to build microservices.
As shown in Figure 4-10, you can create and run microservices in Service Fabric either as simple 
processes or as Docker containers. It’s also possible to mix container-based microservices with 
process-based microservices within the same Service Fabric cluster.33 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-10. Deploying microservices as processes or as containers in Azure Service Fabric
In the first image, you see microservices as processes, where each node runs one process for each 
microservice. In the second image, you see microservices as containers, where each node runs Docker 
with several containers, one container per microservice. Service Fabric clusters based on Linux and 
Windows hosts can run Docker Linux containers and Windows Containers, respectively.
For up-to-date information about containers support in Azure Service Fabric, see Service Fabric and 
containers.
Service Fabric is a good example of a platform where you can define a different logical architecture 
(business microservices or Bounded Contexts) than the physical implementation. For example, if you 
implement Stateful Reliable Services in Azure Service Fabric, which are introduced in the next section, 
“Stateless versus stateful microservices,” you have a business microservice concept with multiple 
physical services.
As shown in Figure 4-10, and thinking from a logical/business microservice perspective, when 
implementing a Service Fabric Stateful Reliable Service, you usually will need to implement two tiers 
of services. The first is the back-end stateful reliable service, which handles multiple partitions (each 
partition is a stateful service). The second is the front-end service, or Gateway service, in charge of 
routing and data aggregation across multiple partitions or stateful service instances. That Gateway 
service also handles client-side communication with retry loops accessing the back-end service. It’s 
called a Gateway service if you implement your custom service, or alternatively you can also use the 
out-of-the-box Service Fabric reverse proxy.34 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-11. Business microservice with several stateful service instances and a custom gateway front end
In any case, when you use Service Fabric Stateful Reliable Services, you also have a logical or business 
microservice (Bounded Context) that’s composed of multiple physical services. Each of them, the 
Gateway service, and Partition service could be implemented as ASP.NET Web API services, as shown 
in Figure 4-11. Service Fabric has prescription to support several stateful reliable services in containers.
In Service Fabric, you can group and deploy groups of services as a Service Fabric Application, which is 
the unit of packaging and deployment for the orchestrator or cluster. Therefore, the Service Fabric 
Application could be mapped to this autonomous business and logical microservice boundary or 
Bounded Context, as well, so you could deploy these services autonomously.
Service Fabric and containers
With regard to containers in Service Fabric, you can also deploy services in container images within a 
Service Fabric cluster. As Figure 4-12 shows, most of the time there will only be one container per 
service.
Figure 4-12. Business microservice with several services (containers) in Service Fabric35 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
A Service Fabric application can run several containers accessing an external database and the whole 
set would be the logical boundary of a Business Microservice. However, so-called “sidecar” containers 
(two containers that must be deployed together as part of a logical service) are also possible in 
Service Fabric. The important thing is that a business microservice is the logical boundary around 
several cohesive elements. In many cases, it might be a single service with a single data model, but in 
some other cases you might have several physical services as well.
Note that you can mix services in processes, and services in containers, in the same Service Fabric 
application, as shown in Figure 4-13.
Figure 4-13. Business microservice mapped to a Service Fabric application with containers and stateful services
For more information about container support in Azure Service Fabric, see Service Fabric and 
containers.
Stateless versus stateful microservices
As mentioned earlier, each microservice (logical Bounded Context) must own its domain model (data 
and logic). In the case of stateless microservices, the databases will be external, employing relational 
options like SQL Server, or NoSQL options like Azure Cosmos DB or MongoDB.
But the services themselves can also be stateful in Service Fabric, which means that the data resides 
within the microservice. This data might exist not just on the same server, but within the microservice 
process, in memory and persisted on hard drives and replicated to other nodes. Figure 4-14 shows the 
different approaches.36 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-14. Stateless versus stateful microservices
In stateless services, the state (persistence, database) is kept out of the microservice. In stateful 
services, state is kept inside the microservice. A stateless approach is perfectly valid and is easier to 
implement than stateful microservices, since the approach is similar to traditional and well-known 
patterns. But stateless microservices impose latency between the process and data sources. They also 
involve more moving pieces when you’re trying to improve performance with additional cache and 
queues. The result is that you can end up with complex architectures that have too many tiers.
In contrast, stateful microservices can excel in advanced scenarios, because there’s no latency between 
the domain logic and data. Heavy data processing, gaming back ends, databases as a service, and 
other low-latency scenarios all benefit from stateful services, which enable local state for faster access.
Stateless and stateful services are complementary. For instance, as you can see in the right diagram in 
Figure 4-14, a stateful service can be split into multiple partitions. To access those partitions, you 
might need a stateless service acting as a gateway service that knows how to address each partition 
based on partition keys.
Stateful services do have drawbacks. They impose a high complexity level to be scaled out. 
Functionality that would usually be implemented by external database systems must be addressed for 
tasks such as data replication across stateful microservices and data partitioning. However, this is one 
of the areas where an orchestrator like Azure Service Fabric with its stateful reliable services can help 
the most—by simplifying the development and lifecycle of stateful microservices using the Reliable 
Services API and Reliable Actors.
Other microservice frameworks that allow stateful services, support the Actor pattern, and improve 
fault tolerance and latency between business logic and data are Microsoft Orleans, from Microsoft 
Research, and Akka.NET. Both frameworks are currently improving their support for Docker.
Remember that Docker containers are themselves stateless. If you want to implement a stateful 
service, you need one of the additional prescriptive and higher-level frameworks noted earlier.
Using Azure Service Fabric Mesh
Azure Service Fabric Mesh is a fully managed service that enables developers to build and deploy 
mission critical applications without managing any infrastructure. Use Service Fabric Mesh to build 
and run secure, distributed microservices applications that scale on demand.37 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
As shown in figure 4-15, applications hosted on Service Fabric Mesh run and scale without you 
worrying about the infrastructure powering it.
Figure 4-15. Deploying a microservice/containers application to Service Fabric Mesh
Under the covers, Service Fabric Mesh consists of clusters of thousands of machines. All cluster 
operations are hidden from the developer. You simply need to upload your containers and specify 
resources you need, availability requirements, and resource limits. Service Fabric Mesh automatically 
allocates the infrastructure requested by your application deployment and also handles infrastructure 
failures, making sure your applications are highly available. You only need to care about the health 
and responsiveness of your application, not the infrastructure.
For further information, see the Service Fabric Mesh documentation.
Choosing orchestrators in Azure
The following table provides guidance on what orchestrator to use depending on workloads and OS 
focus.
Figure 4-16. Orchestrator selection in Azure guidance38 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
You can interact with AKS using your preferred client operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) 
with Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) installed. For more details, refer Azure CLI 
documentation and Installation guide for the available environments.
Create the AKS environment in Azure
There are several ways to create the AKS Environment. It can be done by using Azure CLI commands 
or by using the Azure portal.
Here you can explore some examples using the Azure CLI to create the cluster and the Azure portal to 
review the results. You also need to have Kubectl and Docker in your development machine.
Create the AKS cluster
Create the AKS cluster using this command (the resource group must exist):
az aks create --resource-group explore-docker-aks-rg --name explore-docker-aks --nodevm-size Standard_B2s --node-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys --location westeurope
Note
The --node-vm-size and --node-count parameter values are good enough for a sample/dev 
application.
After the creation job finishes, you can see:
• The AKS cluster created in the initial resource group
• A new, related resource group, containing the resources related to the AKS cluster, as show in 
the following images.
The initial resource group, with the AKS cluster:39 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-17. AKS Resource Group view from Azure.
The AKS cluster resource group:
Figure 4-18. AKS view from Azure.
Important
In general, you shouldn’t need to modify the resources in the AKS cluster resource group. For 
example, the resource group is deleted when you delete the AKS cluster.
You can also view the node created using Azure CLI and Kubectl.
First, getting the credentials:
az aks get-credentials --resource-group explore-docker-aks-rg --name explore-dockeraks40 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-19. aks get-credentials command result.
And then, getting nodes from Kubectl:
kubectl get nodes
Figure 4-20. kubectl get nodes command result.
Development environment for Docker apps
Development tools choices: IDE or editor
No matter if you prefer a full and powerful IDE or a lightweight and agile editor, Microsoft has you 
covered when it comes to developing Docker applications.
Visual Studio Code and Docker CLI (cross-platform tools for Mac, Linux, and 
Windows)
If you prefer a lightweight, cross-platform editor supporting any development language, you can use 
Visual Studio Code and Docker CLI. These products provide a simple yet robust experience, which is 
critical for streamlining the developer workflow. By installing “Docker for Mac” or “Docker for 
Windows” (development environment), Docker developers can use a single Docker CLI to build apps 
for both Windows or Linux (runtime environment). Plus, Visual Studio Code supports extensions for 
Docker with IntelliSense for Dockerfiles and shortcut-tasks to run Docker commands from the editor.
Note
To download Visual Studio Code, go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
To download Docker for Mac and Windows, go to https://www.docker.com/products/docker.
Visual Studio with Docker Tools (Windows development machine)
It’s recommended that you use Visual Studio 2022 or later with the built-in Docker Tools enabled. 
With Visual Studio, you can develop, run, and validate your applications directly in the chosen Docker 
environment. Press F5 to debug your application (single container or multiple containers) directly in a 
Docker host, or press Ctrl+F5 to edit and refresh your app without having to rebuild the container. It’s 
the simplest and most powerful choice for Windows developers to create Docker containers for Linux 
or Windows.41 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Visual Studio for Mac (Mac development machine)
You can use Visual Studio for Mac when developing Docker-based applications. Visual Studio for Mac 
offers a richer IDE when compared to Visual Studio Code for Mac.
Language and framework choices
You can develop Docker applications using Microsoft tools with most modern languages. The 
following is an initial list, but you’re not limited to it:
• .NET and ASP.NET Core
• Node.js
• Go
• Java
• Ruby
• Python
Basically, you can use any modern language supported by Docker in Linux or Windows.
Inner-loop development workflow for Docker apps
Before triggering the outer-loop workflow spanning the entire DevOps cycle, it all begins on each 
developer’s machine, coding the app itself, using their preferred languages or platforms, and testing it 
locally (Figure 4-21). But in every case, you’ll have an important point in common, no matter what 
language, framework, or platforms you choose. In this specific workflow, you’re always developing and 
testing Docker containers in no other environments, but locally.
Figure 4-21. Inner-loop development context
The container or instance of a Docker image will contain these components:
• An operating system selection (for example, a Linux distribution or Windows)
• Files added by the developer (for example, app binaries)
• Configuration (for example, environment settings and dependencies)
• Instructions for what processes to run by Docker
You can set up the inner-loop development workflow that utilizes Docker as the process (described in 
the next section). Consider that the initial steps to set up the environment are not included, because 
you only need to do it once.42 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Building a single app within a Docker container using Visual Studio 
Code and Docker CLI
Apps are made up from your own services plus additional libraries (dependencies).
Figure 4-22 shows the basic steps that you usually need to carry out when building a Docker app, 
followed by detailed descriptions of each step.
Figure 4-22. High-level workflow for the life cycle for Docker containerized applications using Docker CLI
Step 1: Start coding in Visual Studio Code and create your initial app/service 
baseline
The way you develop your application is similar to the way you do it without Docker. The difference is 
that while developing, you’re deploying and testing your application or services running within Docker 
containers placed in your local environment (like a Linux VM or Windows).
Setting up your local environment
With the latest versions of Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows, it’s easier than ever to develop 
Docker applications, and the setup is straightforward.
Tip
For instructions on setting up Docker Desktop for Windows, go to https://docs.docker.com/dockerfor-windows/.
For instructions on setting up Docker Desktop for Mac, go to https://docs.docker.com/docker-formac/.
In addition, you’ll need a code editor so that you can actually develop your application while using 
Docker CLI.43 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Microsoft provides Visual Studio Code, which is a lightweight code editor that’s supported on 
Windows, Linux, and macOS, and provides IntelliSense with support for many languages (JavaScript, 
.NET, Go, Java, Ruby, Python, and most modern languages), debugging, integration with Git and 
extensions support. This editor is a great fit for macOS and Linux developers. In Windows, you also 
can use Visual Studio.
Tip
For instructions on installing Visual Studio Code for Windows, Linux, or macOS, go to 
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview/.
For instructions on setting up Docker for Mac, go to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/.
You can work with Docker CLI and write your code using any code editor, but using Visual Studio 
Code with the Docker extension makes it easy to author Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files in 
your workspace. You can also run tasks and scripts from the Visual Studio Code IDE to execute Docker 
commands using the Docker CLI underneath.
The Docker extension for VS Code provides the following features:
• Automatic Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file generation
• Syntax highlighting and hover tips for docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile files
• IntelliSense (completions) for Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files
• Linting (errors and warnings) for Dockerfile files
• Command Palette (F1) integration for the most common Docker commands
• Explorer integration for managing Images and Containers
• Deploy images from DockerHub and Azure Container Registries to Azure App Service
To install the Docker extension, press Ctrl+Shift+P, type ext install, and then run the Install Extension 
command to bring up the Marketplace extension list. Next, type docker to filter the results, and then 
select the Docker Support extension, as depicted in Figure 4-23.
Figure 4-23. Installing the Docker Extension in Visual Studio Code44 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Step 2: Create a DockerFile related to an existing image (plain OS or dev 
environments like .NET, Node.js, and Ruby)
You’ll need a DockerFile per custom image to be built and per container to be deployed. If your app is 
made up of single custom service, you’ll need a single DockerFile. But if your app is composed of 
multiple services (as in a microservices architecture), you’ll need one Dockerfile per service.
The DockerFile is commonly placed in the root folder of your app or service and contains the required 
commands so that Docker knows how to set up and run that app or service. You can create your 
DockerFile and add it to your project along with your code (node.js, .NET, etc.), or, if you’re new to the 
environment, take a look at the following Tip.
Tip
You can use the Docker extension to guide you when using the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml 
files related to your Docker containers. Eventually, you’ll probably write these kinds of files without 
this tool, but using the Docker extension is a good starting point that will accelerate your learning 
curve.
In Figure 4-24, you can see the steps to add the docker files to a project by using the Docker 
Extension for VS Code:
1. Open the command palette, type “docker” and select “Add Docker Files to Workspace”.
2. Select Application Platform (ASP.NET Core)
3. Select Operating System (Linux)
4. Include optional Docker Compose files
5. Enter ports to publish (80, 443)
6. Select the project45 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-24. Docker files added using the Add Docker files to Workspace command
When you add a DockerFile, you specify what base Docker image you’ll be using (like using FROM 
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet). You’ll usually build your custom image on top of a base image 
that you get from any official repository at the Docker Hub registry (like an image for .NET or the one 
for Node.js).
Tip
You’ll have to repeat this procedure for every project in your application. However, the extension will 
ask to overwrite the generated docker-compose file after the first time. You should reply to not 
overwrite it, so the extension creates separate docker-compose files, that you can then merge by 
hand, prior to running docker-compose.
Use an existing official Docker image
Using an official repository of a language stack with a version number ensures that the same language 
features are available on all machines (including development, testing, and production).
The following is a sample DockerFile for a .NET container:46 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["src/WebApi/WebApi.csproj", "src/WebApi/"]
RUN dotnet restore "src/WebApi/WebApi.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/src/WebApi"
RUN dotnet build "WebApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build
FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "WebApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish
FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "WebApi.dll"]
In this case, the image is based on version 6.0 of the official ASP.NET Core Docker image (multi-arch 
for Linux and Windows), as per the line FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0. (For more 
information about this topic, see the ASP.NET Core Docker Image page and the .NET Docker Image
page).
In the DockerFile, you can also instruct Docker to listen to the TCP port that you’ll use at run time 
(such as port 80 or 443).
You can specify additional configuration settings in the Dockerfile, depending on the language and 
framework you’re using. For instance, the ENTRYPOINT line with ["dotnet", "WebMvcApplication.dll"] 
tells Docker to run a .NET application. If you’re using the SDK and the .NET CLI (dotnet CLI) to build 
and run the .NET application, this setting would be different. The key point here is that the 
ENTRYPOINT line and other settings depend on the language and platform you choose for your 
application.
Tip
For more information about building Docker images for .NET applications, see 
https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/build-container.
To learn more about building your own images, go to 
https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerimages/.
Use multi-arch image repositories
A single image name in a repo can contain platform variants, such as a Linux image and a Windows 
image. This feature allows vendors like Microsoft (base image creators) to create a single repo to 
cover multiple platforms (that is, Linux and Windows). For example, the dotnet/aspnet repository 
available in the Docker Hub registry provides support for Linux and Windows Nano Server by using 
the same image name.
Pulling the dotnet/aspnet image from a Windows host pulls the Windows variant, whereas pulling the 
same image name from a Linux host pulls the Linux variant.47 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Create your base image from scratch
You can create your own Docker base image from scratch as explained in this article from Docker. This 
scenario is probably not the best for you if you’re just starting with Docker, but if you want to set the 
specific bits of your own base image, you can do it.
Step 3: Create your custom Docker images embedding your service in it
For each custom service that comprises your app, you’ll need to create a related image. If your app is 
made up of a single service or web app, you’ll need just a single image.
Note
When taking into account the “outer-loop DevOps workflow”, the images will be created by an 
automated build process whenever you push your source code to a Git repository (Continuous 
Integration), so the images will be created in that global environment from your source code.
But before you consider going to that outer-loop route, you need to ensure that the Docker 
application is actually working properly so that they don’t push code that might not work properly to 
the source control system (Git, etc.).
Therefore, each developer first needs to do the entire inner-loop process to test locally and continue 
developing until they want to push a complete feature or change to the source control system.
To create an image in your local environment and using the DockerFile, you can use the docker build 
command, as shown in Figure 4-25, because it already tags the image for you and builds the images 
for all services in the application with a simple command.
Figure 4-25. Running docker build
Optionally, instead of directly running docker build from the project folder, you first can generate a 
deployable folder with the .NET libraries needed by using the run dotnet publish command, and then 
run docker build.
This example creates a Docker image with the name webapi:latest (:latest is a tag, like a specific 
version). You can take this step for each custom image you need to create for your composed Docker 48 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
application with several containers. However, we’ll see in the next section that it’s easier to do this 
using docker-compose.
You can find the existing images in your local repository (your development machine) by using the 
docker images command, as illustrated in Figure 4-26.
Figure 4-26. Viewing existing images using docker images
Step 4: Define your services in docker-compose.yml when building a composed 
Docker app with multiple services
With the docker-compose.yml file, you can define a set of related services to be deployed as a 
composed application with the deployment commands explained in the next step section.
Create that file in your main or root solution folder; it should have content similar to that shown in this 
docker-compose.yml file:
version: "3.4"
services:
 webapi:
 image: webapi
 build:
 context: .
 dockerfile: src/WebApi/Dockerfile
 ports:
 - 51080:80
 depends_on:
 - redis
 environment:
 - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
 - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80
 webapp:
 image: webapp
 build:
 context: .
 dockerfile: src/WebApp/Dockerfile
 ports:
 - 50080:80
 environment:
 - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
 - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80
 - WebApiBaseAddress=http://webapi
 redis:
 image: redis
In this particular case, this file defines three services: the web API service (your custom service), a web 
application, and the Redis service (a popular cache service). Each service will be deployed as a 
container, so you need to use a concrete Docker image for each. For this particular application:49 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
• The web API service is built from the DockerFile in the src/WebApi/Dockerfile directory.
• The host port 51080 is forwarded to the exposed port 80 on the webapi container.
• The web API service depends on the Redis service
• The web application accesses the web API service using the internal address: http://webapi.
• The Redis service uses the latest public redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry. 
Redis is a popular cache system for server-side applications.
Step 5: Build and run your Docker app
If your app has only a single container, you just need to run it by deploying it to your Docker Host 
(VM or physical server). However, if your app is made up of multiple services, you need to compose it, 
too. Let’s see the different options.
Option A: Run a single container or service
You can run the Docker image by using the docker run command, as shown here:
docker run -t -d -p 50080:80 webapp:latest
For this particular deployment, we’ll be redirecting requests sent to port 50080 on the host to the 
internal port 80.
Option B: Compose and run a multiple-container application
In most enterprise scenarios, a Docker application will be composed of multiple services. For these 
cases, you can run the docker-compose up command (Figure 4-27), which will use the dockercompose.yml file that you created previously. Running this command builds all custom images and 
deploys the composed application with all of its related containers.50 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-27. Results of running the “docker-compose up” command
After you run docker-compose up, you deploy your application and its related container(s) into your 
Docker Host, as illustrated in Figure 4-28, in the VM representation.
Figure 4-28. VM with Docker containers deployed
Step 6: Test your Docker application (locally, in your local CD VM)
This step will vary depending on what your app is doing.
In a simple .NET Web API “Hello World” deployed as a single container or service, you’d just need to 
access the service by providing the TCP port specified in the DockerFile.
On the Docker host, open a browser and navigate to that site; you should see your app/service 
running, as demonstrated in Figure 4-29.51 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-29. Testing your Docker application locally by using the browser
Note that it’s using port 50080, but internally it’s being redirected to port 80, because that’s how it 
was deployed with docker compose, as explained earlier.
You can test this by using the browser using CURL from the terminal, as depicted in Figure 4-30.
Figure 4-30. Testing a Docker application locally by using CURL
Debugging a container running on Docker
Visual Studio Code supports debugging Docker if you’re using Node.js and other platforms like .NET 
containers.52 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
You also can debug .NET or .NET Framework containers in Docker when using Visual Studio for 
Windows or Mac, as described in the next section.
Tip
To learn more about debugging Node.js Docker containers, see 
https://learn.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/user_ed/visual-studio-code-new-features-13-bigdebugging-updates-rich-object-hover-conditional-breakpoints-node-js-mono-more.
Use Docker Tools in Visual Studio on Windows
The developer workflow when using the Docker Tools included in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 and 
later, is similar to using Visual Studio Code and Docker CLI (in fact, it’s based on the same Docker CLI), 
but it’s easier to get started, simplifies the process, and provides greater productivity for the build, 
run, and compose tasks. It can also run and debug your containers via the usual F5 and Ctrl+F5keys 
from Visual Studio. You can even debug a whole solution if its containers are defined in the same 
docker-compose.yml file at the solution level.
Configure your local environment
With the latest versions of Docker for Windows, it’s easier than ever to develop Docker applications 
because the setup is straightforward, as explained in the following references.
Tip
To learn more about installing Docker for Windows, go to (https://docs.docker.com/docker-forwindows/).
Docker support in Visual Studio
There are two levels of Docker support you can add to a project. In ASP.NET Core projects, you can 
just add a Dockerfile file to the project by enabling Docker support. The next level is container 
orchestration support, which adds a Dockerfile to the project (if it doesn’t already exist) and a dockercompose.yml file at the solution level. Container orchestration support, via Docker Compose, is 
available in Visual Studio 2022 versions 17.0. Container orchestration support is an opt-in feature in 
Visual Studio 2022 versions 17.0 or later. Visual Studio 2022 also supports Kubernetes/Helm
deployment.
The Add > Docker Support and Add > Container Orchestrator Support commands are located on 
the right-click menu (or context menu) of the project node for an ASP.NET Core project in Solution 
Explorer, as shown in Figure 4-31:53 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-31. Adding Docker support to a Visual Studio project
Add Docker support
Besides the option to add Docker support to an existing application, as shown in the previous section, 
you can also enable Docker support during project creation by selecting Enable Docker Support in 
the New ASP.NET Core Web Application dialog box that opens after you click OK in the New 
Project dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-32.54 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-32. Enable Docker support during project creation in Visual Studio
When you add or enable Docker support, Visual Studio adds a Dockerfile file to the project, that 
includes references to all required project from the solution.
Add container orchestration support
When you want to compose a multi-container solution, add container orchestration support to your 
projects. This lets you run and debug a group of containers (a whole solution) at the same time if 
they’re defined in the same docker-compose.yml file.
To add container orchestration support, right-click on the project node in Solution Explorer, and 
choose Add > Container Orchestration Support. Then choose Docker Compose to manage the 
containers.
After you add container orchestration support to your project, you see a Dockerfile added to the 
project and a docker-compose folder added to the solution in Solution Explorer, as shown in Figure 
4-33:55 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure

If docker-compose.yml already exists, Visual Studio just adds the required lines of configuration code 
to it.

Using Windows PowerShell commands in a 
DockerFile to set up Windows Containers (Docker 
standard based)
With Windows Containers, you can convert your existing Windows applications to Docker images and 
deploy them with the same tools as the rest of the Docker ecosystem.57 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
To use Windows Containers, you just need to write Windows PowerShell commands in the DockerFile, 
as demonstrated in the following example:
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019
LABEL Description="IIS" Vendor="Microsoft" Version="10"
RUN powershell Get-WindowsFeature web-server
RUN powershell Install-windowsfeature web-server
RUN powershell add-windowsfeature web-asp-net45
CMD [ "ping", "localhost", "-t" ]
In this case, we’re using Windows PowerShell to install a Windows Server Core base image as well 
as IIS.
In a similar way, you also could use Windows PowerShell commands to set up additional components 
like the traditional ASP.NET 4.x and .NET Framework 4.6 or any other Windows software, as shown 
here:
RUN powershell add-windowsfeature web-asp-net45
Build ASP.NET Core applications deployed as Linux 
containers into an AKS/Kubernetes orchestrator
Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) is Azure’s managed Kubernetes orchestrations services that simplify 
container deployment and management.
The main features of AKS are:
• An Azure-hosted control plane.
• Automated upgrades.
• Self-healing.
• User-configurable scaling.
• Simpler user experience for both developers and cluster operators.
The following examples explore the creation of an ASP.NET Core 6.0 application that runs on Linux 
and deploys to an AKS Cluster in Azure. Development is done using Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0.
Creating the ASP.NET Core Project using Visual Studio 2022
ASP.NET Core is a general-purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET 
community on GitHub. It’s cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used in 
device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.
This example uses a couple of simple projects based on Visual Studio templates, so you don’t need 
much additional knowledge to create the sample. You only have to create the project using a 
standard template that includes all the elements to run a small project with a REST API and a Web 
App with Razor pages, using ASP.NET Core 6.0 technology.
For reference, you can download the sample from .NET Application Architecture’s repo exploredocker.58 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-35. Creating an ASP.NET Core Web Application in Visual Studio 2022.
To create the sample project in Visual Studio, select File > New > Project, select the Web project 
type and then the ASP.NET Core Web Api template. You can also search for the template if you need 
it.
Then enter the application name and location as shown in the next image.59 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-36. Enter the project name and location in Visual Studio 2022.
Verify that you’ve selected ASP.NET Core 6.0 as the framework. .NET 6 is included in the latest release 
of Visual Studio 2022 and is automatically installed and configured for you when you install Visual 
Studio.60 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-37. Selecting ASP.NET CORE 6.0 and Web API project type
Notice Docker support is not enabled now. You’ll do that in the next step after the project creation. 
You’ll also notice that by default controller option is checked. You can uncheck that if you want to 
Create a minimal web API with ASP.NET Core.
To show you can “Dockerize” your project at any time, you’ll add Docker support now. So right-click 
on the project node in Solution Explorer and select Add > Docker support on the context menu.61 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-38. Adding Docker support to an existing project
To complete adding Docker support, you can choose Windows or Linux. In this case, select Linux.
Figure 4-39. Selecting Linux containers.62 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
With these simple steps, you have your ASP.NET Core 6.0 application running on a Linux container.
In a similar way, you can also add a very simple WebApp project (Figure 4-40) to consume the web 
API endpoint, although the details can be seen in the code repo.
After that, you add orchestrator support for your WebApi project as shown next, in image 4-40.
Figure 4-40. Adding orchestrator support to WebApi project.
When you choose the Docker Compose option, which is fine for local development, Visual Studio 
adds the docker-compose project, with the docker-compose files as shown in image 4-41.63 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-41. Adding orchestrator support to WebApi project.
The initial files added are similar to these ones:
docker-compose.yml
version: "3.4"
services:
 webapi:
 image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}webapi
 build:
 context: .
 dockerfile: WebApi/Dockerfile
 webapp:
 image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}webapp
 build:
 context: .
 dockerfile: WebApp/Dockerfile
docker-compose.override.yml
version: "3.4"
services:
 webapi:
 environment:
 - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
 - ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+:443;http://+:80
 ports:
 - "80"
 - "443"
 volumes:
 - ${APPDATA}/Microsoft/UserSecrets:/root/.microsoft/usersecrets:ro
 - ${APPDATA}/ASP.NET/Https:/root/.aspnet/https:ro
 webapp:
 environment:
 - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
 - ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+:443;http://+:80
 ports:

 - "443"64 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
 volumes:
 - ${APPDATA}/Microsoft/UserSecrets:/root/.microsoft/usersecrets:ro
 - ${APPDATA}/ASP.NET/Https:/root/.aspnet/https:ro
To run your app with Docker Compose, you just have to make a few tweaks to dockercompose.override.yml.
services:
 webapi:
 #...
 ports:
 - "51080:80"
 - "51443:443"
 #...
 webapp:
 environment:
 #...
 - WebApiBaseAddress=http://webapi
 ports:
 - "50080:80"
 - "50443:443"
 #...
Now you can run your application with the F5 key, or by using the Play button, or the Ctrl+F5 key, 
selecting the docker-compose project, as shown in image 4-42.
Figure 4-42. Adding orchestrator support to WebApi project.
When running the docker-compose application as explained, you get:
1. The images built and containers created as per the docker-compose file.
2. The browser open in the address configured in the “Properties” dialog for the dockercompose project.
3. The Container window open (in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 and later).
4. Debugger support for all projects in the solution, as shown in the following images.
Browser opened:65 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-43. Browser window with an application running on multiple containers.
Containers window:
Figure 4-44. Visual Studio “Containers” window
The Containers window lets you view running containers, browse available images, view environment 
variables, logs, and port mappings, inspect the filesystem, attach a debugger, or open a terminal 
window inside the container environment.
As you can see, the integration between Visual Studio 2022 and Docker is completely oriented to the 
developer’s productivity.
Of course, you can also list the images using the docker images command. You should see the webapi 
and webapp images with the dev tags created by the automatic deployment of our project with Visual 
Studio 2022.
docker images66 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-45. View of Docker images
Register the Solution in an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
You can upload the images to the Azure Container Registry (ACR), but you could also use Docker Hub 
or any other registry, so the images can be deployed to the AKS cluster from that registry.
Create an ACR instance
Run the following command from the az cli:
az acr create --name exploredocker --resource-group explore-docker-aks-rg --sku basic 
--admin-enabled
Note
The container registry name (for example, exploredocker) must be unique within Azure and contain 5-
50 alphanumeric characters. For more details, see Create a container registry.
Create the image in Release mode
You’ll now create the image in Release mode (ready for production) by changing to Release, as 
shown in Figure 4-46, and running the application as you did before.
Figure 4-46. Selecting Release Mode
If you execute the docker images command, you’ll see both images created, one for debug (dev) and 
the other for release (latest) mode.
Create a new Tag for the Image
Each container image needs to be tagged with the loginServer name of the registry. This tag is used 
for routing when pushing container images to an image registry.
You can view the loginServer name from the Azure portal, taking the information from the Azure 
Container Registry67 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-47. View of the name of the Registry
Or by running the following command:
az acr list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query 
"[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table
Figure 4-48. Get the name of the registry using az cli
In both cases, you’ll obtain the name. In our example, exploredocker.azurecr.io.
Now you can tag the image, taking the latest image (the Release image), with the command:
docker tag <image-name>:latest <login-server-name>/<image-name>:v1
After running the docker tag command, list the images with the docker images command, and you 
should see the image with the new tag.
Figure 4-49. View of tagged images
Push the image into the Azure ACR
Log in to the Azure Container Registry
az acr login --name exploredocker
Push the image into the Azure ACR, using the following command:
docker push <login-server-name>/<image-name>:v168 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
This command takes a while uploading the images but gives you feedback in the process. In the 
following image, you can see the output from one image completed and another in progress.
Figure 4-50. Console output from the push command.
To deploy your multi-container app into your AKS cluster you need some manifest .yaml files that 
have, most of the properties taken from the docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.override.yml 
files.

Tip
You can see how to create the AKS Cluster for this sample in section Deploy to Azure Kubernetes 
Service (AKS) on this guide.
Now you’re almost ready to deploy using kubectl, but first you must get the credentials from the AKS 
Cluster with this command:
az aks get-credentials --resource-group explore-docker-aks-rg --name explore-docker-aks
Figure 4-51. Getting credentials from AKS into the kubectl environment.
You also have to allow the AKS cluster to pull images from the ACR, using this command:
az aks update --name explore-docker-aks --resource-group explore-docker-aks-rg --attach-acr 
exploredocker
The previous command might take a couple of minutes to complete. Then, use the kubectl apply 
command to launch the deployments, and then kubectl get all to list the cluster objects.
kubectl apply -f deploy-webapi.yml
kubectl apply -f deploy-webapp.yml
kubectl get all71 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-52. Deployment to Kubernetes
You’ll have to wait a while until the load balancer gets the external IP, checking with kubectl get 
services, and then the application should be available at that address, as shown in the next image:72 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-53. Deployment to Kubernetes
When the deployment completes, you can access the Kubernetes Web UI with a local proxy, using an 
ssh tunnel.
First you must create a ClusterRoleBinding with the following command:
kubectl create clusterrolebinding kubernetes-dashboard --clusterrole=cluster-admin --
serviceaccount=kube-system:kubernetes-dashboard
And then this command to start the proxy:
az aks browse --resource-group exploredocker-aks-rg --name explore-docker-aks
A browser window should open at http://127.0.0.1:8001 with a view similar to this one:73 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure
Figure 4-54. View Kubernetes cluster information
Now you have your ASP.NET Core application, running in Linux containers, and deployed to an AKS 
cluster on Azure.

CHAPTER 5
Docker application 
DevOps workflow with 
Microsoft tools
Microsoft Visual Studio, Azure DevOps Services and/or GitHub, Team Foundation Server, and Azure 
Monitor provide a comprehensive ecosystem for development and IT operations that give your team the 
tools to manage projects and rapidly build, test, and deploy containerized applications.
Teams can choose which tools and platforms they want to use for end to end DevOps. With Visual 
Studio and Azure DevOps Services in the cloud, along with Team Foundation Server on-premises, 
development teams can productively build, test, and release containerized applications that target 
either Windows or Linux. Alternatively, teams can also use Visual Studio Code and GitHub. Teams can 
even use combinations: for example, storing source code in GitHub and using Azure Boards for work 
item tracking and Azure Pipelines for CI/CD.
Microsoft tools can automate the pipeline for specific implementations of containerized 
applications—Docker, .NET, or any combination with other platforms—from global builds and 
Continuous Integration (CI) and tests with Azure DevOps Services, Team Foundation Server or GitHub, 
to Continuous Deployment (CD) to Docker environments (Development, Staging, Production), and to 
transmit analytics information about the services to the development team through Azure Monitor. 
Every code commit can initiate a build (CI) and automatically deploy the services to specific 
containerized environments (CD).
Developers and testers can easily and quickly provision production-like development and test 
environments based on Docker by using templates in Microsoft Azure.
The complexity of containerized application development increases steadily depending on the 
business complexity and scalability needs. A good example of this complexity are applications based 
on microservices architectures. To succeed in such an environment, your project must automate the 
entire life cycle—not only the build and deployment, but it also must manage versions along with 
the collection of telemetry. Azure DevOps Services, GitHub and Azure offer the following capabilities:
• Azure DevOps Services/Team Foundation Server source code management (based on Git or 
Team Foundation Version Control), Agile planning (Agile, Scrum, and CMMI are supported), 
CI, release management, and other tools for Agile teams.75 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
• Azure DevOps Services and Team Foundation Server include a powerful and growing 
ecosystem of first and third-party extensions with which you easily can construct a CI, build, 
test, delivery, and release management pipeline for microservices.
• GitHub or GitHub Enterprise Server offer similar capabilities, with source control based on Git, 
Projects and Issues for project tracking, GitHub Actions for automating workflows including 
CI/CD, and GitHub Advanced Security for dependency, secret and vulnerability scanning.
• Run automated tests as part of your build pipeline in Azure DevOps Services or through 
GitHub Actions
• Azure DevOps Services/GitHub can tighten the DevOps life cycle with delivery to multiple 
environments, not just for production environments, but also for testing, including A/B 
experimentation, canary releases, and so on.
• Organizations easily can provision Docker containers from private images stored in Azure 
Container Registry along with any dependency on Azure components (Data, PaaS, etc.) using 
Azure Resource Manager templates with tools they’re already comfortable with.
Steps in the outer-loop DevOps workflow for a 
Docker application
Figure 5-1 presents an end-to-end depiction of the steps comprising the DevOps outer-loop 
workflow. It shows the “outer loop” of DevOps. When code is pushed to the repo, a CI pipeline is 
started, then begins the CD pipeline, where the application gets deployed. Metrics collected from 
deployed applications are fed back into the development workload, where the “inner loop” occurs, so 
development teams have actual data to respond to user and business needs.
Figure 5-1. DevOps outer-loop workflow for Docker applications with Microsoft tools
Now, let’s examine each of these steps in greater detail.76 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
Step 1: Inner-loop development workflow
This step is explained in detail in Chapter 4, but, to recap, here is where the outer-loop begins, the 
moment at which a developer pushes code to the source control management system (like Git) 
initiating CI pipeline actions.
Step 2: Source-Code Control integration and management with Azure 
DevOps Services and Git
At this step, you need to have a version-control system to gather a consolidated version of all the 
code coming from the different developers in the team.
Even though source-code control (SCC) and source-code management might seem second-nature to 
most developers, when creating Docker applications in a DevOps life cycle, it’s critical to emphasize 
that you must not submit the Docker images with the application directly to the global Docker 
Registry (like Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub) from the developer’s machine. On the contrary, 
the Docker images to be released and deployed to production environments must be created solely 
on the source code that’s being integrated in your global build or CI pipeline based on your sourcecode repository (like Git).
The local images, generated by developers, should just be used by them when testing within their 
own machines. That’s why it’s critical to have the DevOps pipeline activated from the SCC code.
Azure DevOps Services and Team Foundation Server support Git and Team Foundation Version 
Control. You can choose between them and use it for an end-to-end Microsoft experience. However, 
you can also manage your code in external repositories (like GitHub, on-premises Git repositories, or 
Subversion) and still be able to connect to it and get the code as the starting point for your DevOps CI 
pipeline. You can also use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.
Step 3: Build, CI, Integrate, and Test with Azure DevOps 
Services/GitHub and Docker
CI has emerged as a standard for modern software testing and delivery. The Docker solution 
maintains a clear separation of concerns between the development and operations teams. The 
immutability of Docker images ensures a repeatable deployment between what’s developed, tested 
through CI, and run in production. Docker Engine deployed across the developer laptops and test 
infrastructure makes the containers portable across environments.
At this point, after you have a version-control system with the correct code submitted, you need a 
build service to pick up the code and run the global build and tests.
The internal workflow for this step (CI, build, test) is about the construction of a CI pipeline consisting 
of your code repository (Git, etc.), your build server (Azure DevOps Services/GitHub), Docker Engine, 
and a Docker Registry.
You can use Azure DevOps Services as the foundation for building your applications and setting your 
CI pipeline, and for publishing the built “artifacts” to an “artifacts repository,” which is explained in the 
next step. Alternatively, you can use GitHub to implement the same workflow.77 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
When using Docker for the deployment, the “final artifacts” to be deployed are Docker images with 
your application or services embedded within them. Those images are pushed or published to a 
Docker Registry (a private repository like the ones you can have in Azure Container Registry, or a 
public one like Docker Hub Registry or GitHub Container Registry, which is commonly used for official 
base images).
Here is the basic concept: The CI pipeline will be kicked-off by a commit to an SCC repository like Git. 
The commit will cause Azure DevOps Services/GitHub to run a build job within a Docker container 
and, upon successful completion of that job, push a Docker image to the Docker Registry, as 
illustrated in Figure 5-2. The first part of the outer loop involves steps 1 to 3, from code, run, debug 
and validate, then the code repo up to the build and test CI step.
Figure 5-2. The steps involved in CI
Here are the basic CI workflow steps with Docker and Azure DevOps Services:78 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
1. The developer pushes a commit to an SCC repository (Git/Azure DevOps Services, GitHub, 
etc.).
2. If you’re using Azure DevOps Services or Git, CI is built in, which means that it’s as simple as 
selecting a check box in Azure DevOps Services. If you’re using an external SCC (like GitHub), 
a webhook will notify Azure DevOps Services of the update or push to Git/GitHub.
3. Azure DevOps Services pulls the SCC repository, including the Dockerfile describing the 
image, as well as the application and test code.
4. Azure DevOps Services builds a Docker image and labels it with a build number.
5. Azure DevOps Services instantiates the Docker container within the provisioned Docker Host, 
and runs the appropriate tests.
6. If the tests are successful, the image is first relabeled to a meaningful name so that you know 
it’s a “blessed build” (like “/1.0.0” or any other label), and then pushed up to your Docker 
Registry (Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, DTR, etc.)
Here are the basic CI workflow steps with Docker and GitHub:
1. The developer pushes a commit to a GitHub repo.
2. CI is built in, so Actions will trigger base on the event filters.
3. GitHub pulls the SCC repository, including the Dockerfile describing the image, as well as the 
application and test code.
4. GitHub builds a Docker image and labels it with a build number.
5. GitHub instantiates the Docker container within the provisioned Docker Host, and runs the 
appropriate tests.
6. If the tests are successful, the image is first relabeled to a meaningful name so that you know 
it’s a “blessed build” (like “/1.0.0” or any other label), and then pushed up to your Docker 
Registry (Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, DTR, etc.)
Implement a CI pipeline with Azure DevOps Services and the Docker extension for 
Azure DevOps Services
Visual Studio Azure DevOps Services contains Build & Release Templates that you can use in your 
CI/CD pipeline with which you can build Docker images, push Docker images to an authenticated 
Docker registry, run Docker images, or run other operations offered by the Docker CLI. It also adds a 
Docker Compose task that you can use to build, push, and run multi-container Docker applications, or 
run other operations offered by the Docker Compose CLI, as shown in Figure 5-3.79 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
Figure 5-3. The Docker CI pipeline in Azure DevOps Services including Build & Release Templates and associated tasks.
You can use these templates and tasks to construct your CI/CD artifacts to Build / Test and Deploy in 
Azure Service Fabric, Azure Kubernetes Service, and similar offerings.
With these Visual Studio Team Services tasks, a build Linux-Docker Host/VM provisioned in Azure and 
your preferred Docker registry (Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, private Docker DTR, or any 
other Docker registry) you can assemble your Docker CI pipeline in a very consistent way.
Requirements:
• Azure DevOps Services, or for on-premises installations, Team Foundation Server 2015 
Update 3 or later.
• An Azure DevOps Services agent that has the Docker binaries.
An easy way to create one of these agents is to use Docker to run a container based on the 
Azure DevOps Services agent Docker image.

Implement a CI pipeline with GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions allow you to create automation scripts that can build Docker images, push Docker 
images to an authenticated Docker registry, run Docker images, or run other operations offered by 
the Docker CLI.
You can use public Actions (such as Azure Login) and run (shell) commands to construct your CI/CD 
artifacts to Build / Test and Deploy in Azure Service Fabric, Azure Kubernetes Service, and similar 
offerings.
With these Actions, a build Linux-Docker Host/VM provisioned in Azure and your preferred Docker 
registry (Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, private Docker DTR, or any other Docker registry) you 
can assemble your Docker CI pipeline in a very consistent way.
Integrate, test, and validate multi-container Docker applications
Typically, most Docker applications are composed of multiple containers rather than a single 
container. A good example is a microservices-oriented application for which you would have one 
container per microservice. But, even without strictly following the microservices approach patterns, 
it’s probable that your Docker application would be composed of multiple containers or services.
Therefore, after building the application containers in the CI pipeline, you also need to deploy, 
integrate, and test the application as a whole with all of its containers within an integration Docker 
host or even into a test cluster to which your containers are distributed.
If you’re using a single host, you can use Docker commands such as docker-compose to build and 
deploy related containers to test and validate the Docker environment in a single VM. But, if you’re 
working with an orchestrator cluster like DC/OS, Kubernetes, or Docker Swarm, you need to deploy 
your containers through a different mechanism or orchestrator, depending on your selected 
cluster/scheduler.
The following are several types of tests that you can run against Docker containers:
• Unit tests for Docker containers
• Testing groups of interrelated applications or microservices
• Test in production and “canary” releases
The important point is that when running integration and functional tests, you must run those tests 
from outside of the containers. Tests are not contained or run in the containers you’re deploying, 
because the containers are based on static images that should be exactly like the ones you’ll be 
deploying to production.81 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
A practical option when testing more advanced scenarios, like including several clusters (test cluster, 
staging cluster, and production cluster) is to publish the images to a registry, so it can be tested in 
various clusters.
Push the custom application Docker image into your global Docker Registry
After the Docker images have been tested and validated, you’ll want to tag and publish them to your 
Docker registry. The Docker registry is a critical piece in the Docker application life cycle because it’s 
the central place where you store your custom test (also known as “blessed images”) to be deployed 
into QA and production environments.
Similar to how the application code stored in your SCC repository (Git, etc.) is your “source of truth,” 
the Docker registry is your “source of truth” for your binary application or bits to be deployed to the 
QA or production environments.
Typically, you might want to have your private repositories for your custom images either in a private 
repository in Azure Container Registry or in an on-premises registry like Docker Trusted Registry, or in 
a public-cloud registry with restricted access (like Docker Hub), although in this last case if your code 
is not open source, you must trust the vendor’s security. Either way, the method you use is similar and 
is based on the docker push command, as shown in Figure 5-4.82 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
Figure 5-4. Publishing custom images to Docker Registry83 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
In step 3, for building integration and testing (CI) you might publish the resulting docker images to a 
private or public registry. There are multiple offerings of Docker registries from cloud vendors like 
Azure Container Registry, Amazon Web Services Container Registry, Google Container Registry, 
GitHub Container Registry, Quay Registry, and so on.
Using the Docker tasks, you can push a set of service images defined by a docker-compose.yml file, 
with multiple tags, to an authenticated Docker registry (like Azure Container Registry), as shown in 
Figure 5-5.

Step 4: CD, Deploy
The immutability of Docker images ensures a repeatable deployment with what’s developed, tested 
through CI, and run in production. After you have the application Docker images published in your 
Docker registry (either private or public), you can deploy them to the several environments that you 
might have (production, QA, staging, etc.) from your CD pipeline by using Azure DevOps Services 
pipeline tasks, Azure DevOps Services Release Management or GitHub Actions.84 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
However, at this point it depends on what kind of Docker application you’re deploying. Deploying a 
simple application (from a composition and deployment point of view) like a monolithic application 
comprising a few containers or services and deployed to a few servers or VMs is different from 
deploying a more complex application like a microservices-oriented application with hyperscale 
capabilities. These two scenarios are explained in the following sections.
Deploying composed Docker applications to multiple Docker environments
Let’s look first at the less-complex scenario: deploying to simple Docker hosts (VMs or servers) in a 
single environment or multiple environments (QA, staging, and production). In this scenario, internally 
your CD pipeline can use docker-compose (from your Azure DevOps Services deployment tasks) to 
deploy the Docker applications with its related set of containers or services, as illustrated in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6. Deploying application containers to simple Docker host environments registry
Figure 5-7 highlights how you can connect your build CI to QA/test environments via Azure DevOps 
Services by clicking Docker Compose in the Add Task dialog box. However, when deploying to staging 
or production environments, you would usually use Release Management features handling multiple 
environments (like QA, staging, and production). If you’re deploying to single Docker hosts, it is using 
the Azure DevOps Services “Docker Compose” task (which is invoking the docker-compose up 
command under the hood). If you’re deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), it uses the Docker 85 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
Deployment task, as explained in the section that follows. Similar steps can be built for deployment 
using GitHub Actions.
Figure 5-7. Adding a Docker Compose task in an Azure DevOps Services pipeline or GitHub workflow
When you create a release in Azure DevOps Services, it takes a set of input artifacts. These artifacts are 
intended to be immutable for the lifetime of the release, across all environments. When you introduce 
containers, the input artifacts identify images in a registry to deploy. Depending on how these images 
are identified, they are not guaranteed to remain the same throughout the duration of the release, the 
most obvious case being when you reference myimage:latest from a docker-compose file.
The Azure DevOps Services templates give you the ability to generate build artifacts that contain 
specific registry image digests that are guaranteed to uniquely identify the same image binary. These 
are what you really want to use as input to a release. You can invoke docker-compose in a run step 
inside GitHub Actions to accomplish the same goal.
Managing releases to Docker environments by using Azure DevOps Services 
Release Management or GitHub Actions
Through the Azure DevOps Services templates, you can build a new image, publish it to a Docker 
registry, run it on Linux or Windows hosts, and use commands such as docker-compose to deploy 
multiple containers as an entire application, all through the Azure DevOps Services Release 
Management capabilities intended for multiple environments, as shown in Figure 5-8.86 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
Figure 5-8. Configuring Azure DevOps Services Docker Compose tasks from Azure DevOps Services Release 
Management
However, keep in mind that the scenario shown in Figure 5-6 and implemented in Figure 5-8 is a 
simple one (it’s deploying to single Docker hosts and VMs, and there will be a single container or 
instance per image) and probably should be used only for development or test scenarios. In most 
enterprise production scenarios, you would want to have High Availability (HA) and easy-to-manage 
scalability by load balancing across multiple nodes, servers, and VMs, plus “intelligent failovers” so if a 
server or node fails, its services and containers will be moved to another host server or VM. In that 
case, you need more advanced technologies such as container clusters, orchestrators, and schedulers. 
Thus, the way to deploy to those clusters is by handling the advanced scenarios explained in the next 
section.
GitHub Actions can be used in the same manner, including the use of environments for approvals.
Deploying Docker applications to Docker clusters
The nature of distributed applications requires compute resources that are also distributed. To have 
production-scale capabilities, you need to have clustering capabilities that provide high scalability and 
high availability based on pooled resources.
You could deploy containers manually to those clusters from a CLI tool or a web UI, but you should 
reserve that kind of manual work to spot deployment testing or management purposes like scalingout or monitoring.
From a CD point of view, you can use Azure DevOps Services or GitHub Actions to run specially made 
deployment tasks from your environments that will deploy your containerized applications to 
distributed clusters in Container Service, as illustrated in Figure 5-9.87 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
Figure 5-9. Deploying distributed applications to Container Service
Initially, when deploying to certain clusters or orchestrators, you would traditionally use specific 
deployment scripts and mechanisms per each orchestrator (that is, Kubernetes and Service Fabric 
have different deployment mechanisms) instead of the simpler and easy-to-use docker-compose tool 
based on the docker-compose.yml definition file. However, thanks to the Azure DevOps Services 
Docker Deploy task, shown in Figure 5-10, now you can also deploy to the supported orchestrators by 
just using your familiar docker-compose.yml file because the tool performs that “translation” for you 
(from your docker-compose.yml file to the format needed by the orchestrator).88 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
Figure 5-10. Adding the Deploy to Kubernetes task to your Environment
Figure 5-11 demonstrates how you can edit the Deploy to Kubernetes task with the sections available 
for configuration. This is the task that will retrieve your ready-to-use custom Docker images to be 
deployed as containers in the cluster.

Step 5: Run and manage
Because running and managing applications at enterprise-production level is a major subject in and of 
itself, and due to the type of operations and people working at that level (IT operations) as well as the 
large scope of this area, the entire next chapter is devoted to explaining it.
Step 6: Monitor and diagnose
This topic also is covered in the next chapter as part of the tasks that IT performs in production 
systems; however, is important to highlight that the insights obtained in this step must feed back to 
the development team so that the application is constantly improved. From that point of view, it’s also 
part of DevOps, although the tasks and operations are commonly performed by IT.
Only when monitoring and diagnostics are 100% within the realm of DevOps are the monitoring 
processes and analytics performed by the development team against testing or beta environments. 
This is done either by performing load testing or by monitoring beta or QA environments, where beta 
testers are trying the new versions.
Create CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps Services for 
a .NET application on Containers and deploying to a 
Kubernetes cluster
In Figure 5-12 you can see the end-to-end DevOps scenario covering the code management, code 
compilation, Docker images build, Docker images push to a Docker registry and finally the 
deployment to a Kubernetes cluster in Azure.90 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
Figure 5-12. CI/CD scenario creating Docker images and deploying to a Kubernetes cluster in Azure
It is important to highlight that the two pipelines, build/CI, and release/CD, are connected through the 
Docker Registry (such as Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry). The Docker registry is one of the 
main differences compared to a traditional CI/CD process without Docker.
As shown in Figure 5-13, the first phase is the build/CI pipeline. In Azure DevOps Services you can 
create build/CI pipelines that will compile the code, create the Docker images, and push them to a 
Docker Registry like Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry.91 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools
Figure 5-13. Build/CI pipeline in Azure DevOps building Docker images and pushing images to a Docker registry
The second phase is to create a deployment/release pipeline. In Azure DevOps Services, you can easily 
create a deployment pipeline targeting a Kubernetes cluster by using the Kubernetes tasks for Azure 
DevOps Services, as shown in Figure 5-14.

CHAPTER 6
Run, manage, and monitor 
Docker production 
environments
Vision: Enterprise applications need to run with high availability and high scalability; IT operations 
need to be able to manage and monitor the environments and the applications themselves.
This last pillar in the containerized Docker applications life cycle is centered on how you can run, 
manage, and monitor your applications in scalable, high availability (HA) production environments.
The way you run your containerized applications in production (infrastructure architecture and 
platform technologies) is very much related and based on the chosen architecture and development 
platforms discussed in Chapter 1 of this e-book.
This chapter examines specific products and technologies from Microsoft and other vendors that you 
can use to effectively run scalable, HA distributed applications plus how you can manage and monitor 
them from the IT perspective.
Run composed and microservices-based 
applications in production environments
Applications composed by multiple microservices do need to be deployed into orchestrator clusters in 
order to simplify the complexity of deployment and make it viable from an IT point of view. Without 
an orchestrator cluster, it would be difficult to deploy and scale out a complex microservices 
application.
Introduction to orchestrators, schedulers, and container clusters
Earlier in this e-book, clusters and schedulers were introduced as part of the discussion on software 
architecture and development. Kubernetes and Service Fabric are examples of Docker clusters. Both of 
these orchestrators can run as a part of the infrastructure provided by Microsoft Azure Kubernetes 
Service.94 CHAPTER 6 | Run, manage, and monitor Docker production environments
When applications are scaled-out across multiple host systems, the ability to manage each host 
system and abstract away the complexity of the underlying platform becomes attractive. That’s 
precisely what orchestrators and schedulers provide. Let’s take a brief look at them here:
• Schedulers. “Scheduling” refers to the ability for an administrator to load a service file onto 
a host system that establishes how to run a specific container. Launching containers in a 
Docker cluster tends to be known as scheduling. Although scheduling refers to the specific act 
of loading the service definition, in a more general sense, schedulers are responsible for 
hooking into a host’s init system to manage services in whatever capacity needed.
A cluster scheduler has multiple goals: using the cluster’s resources efficiently, working with 
user-supplied placement constraints, scheduling applications rapidly to not leave them in a 
pending state, having a degree of “fairness,” being robust to errors, and always be available.
• Orchestrators. Platforms extend life-cycle management capabilities to complex, multicontainer workloads deployed on a cluster of hosts. By abstracting the host infrastructure, 
orchestration tools give users a way to treat the entire cluster as a single deployment target.
The process of orchestration involves tooling and a platform that can automate all aspects of 
application management from initial placement or deployment per container; moving 
containers to different hosts depending on its host’s health or performance; versioning and 
rolling updates and health monitoring functions that support scaling and failover; and many 
more.
Orchestration is a broad term that refers to container scheduling, cluster management, and 
possibly the provisioning of additional hosts.
The capabilities provided by orchestrators and schedulers are complex to develop and create from 
scratch, therefore you usually would want to use orchestration solutions offered by vendors.
Manage production Docker environments
Cluster management and orchestration is the process of controlling a group of hosts. This can involve 
adding and removing hosts from a cluster, getting information about the current state of hosts and 
containers, and starting and stopping processes. Cluster management and orchestration are closely 
tied to scheduling because the scheduler must have access to each host in the cluster in order to 
schedule services. For this reason, the same tool is often used for both purposes.
Container Service and management tools
Container Service provides rapid deployment of popular open-source container clustering and 
orchestration solutions. It uses Docker images to ensure that your application containers are fully 
portable. By using Container Service, you can deploy DC/OS (powered by Mesosphere and Apache 
Mesos) and Docker Swarm clusters with Azure Resource Manager templates or the Azure portal to 
ensure that you can scale these applications to thousands—even tens of thousands—of containers.
You deploy these clusters by using Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and the clusters take advantage 
of Azure networking and storage offerings. To access Container Service, you need an Azure 95 CHAPTER 6 | Run, manage, and monitor Docker production environments
subscription. With Container Service, you can take advantage of the enterprise-grade features of 
Azure while still maintaining application portability, including at the orchestration layers.

platform.

Azure Service Fabric
Another choice for cluster-deployment and management is Azure Service Fabric. Service Fabric is a 
Microsoft microservices platform that includes container orchestration as well as developer 
programming models to build highly scalable microservices applications. Service Fabric supports 
Docker in Linux and Windows Containers and can run in Windows and Linux servers.
The following are Service Fabric management tools:
• Azure portal for Service Fabric cluster-related operations (create/update/delete) a cluster or 
configure its infrastructure (VMs, load balancer, networking, etc.)
• Azure Service Fabric Explorer is a specialized web UI and desktop multi-platform tool that 
provides insights and certain operations on the Service Fabric cluster, from the nodes/VMs 
point of view and from the application and services point of view.96 CHAPTER 6 | Run, manage, and monitor Docker production environments
Monitor containerized application services
It’s critical for applications split into multiple containers and microservices to have a way to monitor 
and analyze the behavior of the whole application.
Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor is an extensible analytics service that monitors your live application. It helps you to 
detect and diagnose performance issues and to understand what users actually do with your app. It’s 
designed for developers, with the intent of helping you to continuously improve the performance and 
usability of your services or applications. Azure Monitor works with both web/services and standalone 
apps on a wide variety of platforms like .NET, Java, Node.js and many other platforms, hosted onpremises or in the cloud.

Security and backup services
There are many support chores with lots of details that you have to handle to ensure your applications 
and infrastructure are in top notch condition to support business needs, and the situation becomes 
more complicated in the microservices realm, so you need a way to have both high-level and detailed 
views when you need to take action.
Azure has the tools to manage and provide a unified view of four critical aspects of both your cloud 
and on-premises resources:
• Security. With Azure Security Center.
– Get full visibility and control over the security of your virtual machines, apps, and 
workloads.
– Centralize the management of your security policies and integrate existing processes 
and tools.
– Detect real threats with advanced analytics.
• Backup. With Azure Backup.
– Avoid costly business disruptions, meet compliance goals, and protect your data 
against ransomware and human errors.
– Keep your backup data encrypted in transit and at rest.97 CHAPTER 6 | Run, manage, and monitor Docker production environments
– Ensure access based on multifactor authentication to prevent unauthorized use.
• On-premises resources. With hybrid cloud solutions.98 CHAPTER 7 | Containerized Docker Application Lifecycle key takeaways
CHAPTER 7
Containerized Docker 
Application Lifecycle key 
takeaways
• Container-based solutions provide important cost-saving benefits because containers solve 
deployment problems caused by dependency failures in production environments, thereby 
improving DevOps and production operations significantly.
• Docker has become the de facto standard in the container industry and is supported by the 
most significant vendors in the Linux and Windows ecosystems, including Microsoft. In the 
future, Docker will be ubiquitous in any datacenter in the cloud or on-premises.
• A Docker container is becoming the standard unit of deployment for any server-based 
application or service.
• Docker orchestrators like the ones provided in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure 
Service Fabric are fundamental and indispensable for any microservices-based or multicontainer applications that have significant complexity and scalability needs.
• An end-to-end DevOps environment that supports Continuous Integration/Continuous 
Deployment (CI/CD) and connects to the production Docker environments can provide agility 
and ultimately improve the time to market of your applications.
• Azure DevOps Services greatly simplifies your DevOps environment by deploying to Docker 
environments from your CI/CD pipelines. This statement applies to simple Docker 
environments as well as to advanced microservice and container orchestrators based on 
Azure.
