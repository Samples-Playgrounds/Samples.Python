{"1": {"Overview of Containers and Docker": {"Learn Docker": {"**Comparing Docker containers with virtual machines**": "Figure 1-3 shows a comparison between VMs and Docker containers.\n\n_Figure 1-3. Comparison of traditional virtual machines to Docker containers_\n\nAs shown in the above diagram, for VMs, there are three base layers in the host server. From the\nbottom-up: Infrastructure, Host Operating System, and a Hypervisor. On top of all that, each VM has\nits own OS and all necessary libraries. On the other hand, for Docker, the host server only has the\nInfrastructure and the OS. On top of that, the container engine keeps containers isolated, but lets\nthem share the single base OS\u2019s services.\n\nBecause containers require far fewer resources (for example, they don\u2019t need a full OS), they\u2019re easy to\ndeploy and they start fast. This allows you to have higher density, meaning that it allows you to run\nmore services on the same hardware unit, thereby reducing costs.\n\nAs a side effect of running on the same kernel, you get less isolation than VMs.\n\nThe main goal of an image is to ensure the same environment (dependencies) across different\ndeployments. This means that you can debug it on your machine and then deploy it to another\nmachine, the same environment guaranteed.\n\nA container image is a way to package an app or service and deploy it in a reliable and reproducible\nway. You could say that Docker isn\u2019t only a technology but also a philosophy and a process.\n\n3 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker\n\nWhen using Docker, you won\u2019t hear developers say, \u201cIt works on my machine, why not in production?\u201d\nThey can just say, \u201cIt runs on Docker\u201d, because the packaged Docker application can be executed on\nany supported Docker environment, and it runs the way it was intended to on all deployment targets\n(such as Dev, QA, staging, and production).", "**A simple analogy**": "Perhaps a simple analogy can help getting the grasp of the core concept of Docker.\n\nLet\u2019s go back in time to the 1950s for a moment. There were no word processors, and the\nphotocopiers were used everywhere (well, kind of).\n\nImagine you\u2019re responsible for quickly issuing batches of letters as required, to mail them to\ncustomers, using real paper and envelopes, to be delivered physically to each customer\u2019s address\n(there was no email back then).\n\nAt some point, you realize the letters are just a composition of a large set of paragraphs, which are\npicked and arranged as needed, according to the purpose of the letter, so you devise a system to\nissue letters quickly, expecting to get a hefty raise.\n\nThe system is simple:\n\n['You begin with a deck of transparent sheets containing one paragraph each.']\n\n['To issue a set of letters, you pick the sheets with the paragraphs you need, then you stack and\\nalign them so they look and read fine.']\n\n['Finally, you place the set in the photocopier and press start to produce as many letters as\\nrequired.']\n\nSo, simplifying, that\u2019s the core idea of Docker.\n\nIn Docker, each layer is the resulting set of changes that happen to the filesystem after executing a\ncommand, such as, installing a program.\n\nSo, when you \u201clook\u201d at the filesystem after the layer has been copied, you see all the files, included the\nlayer when the program was installed.\n\nYou can think of an image as an auxiliary read-only hard disk ready to be installed in a \u201ccomputer\u201d\nwhere the operating system is already installed.\n\nSimilarly, you can think of a container as the \u201ccomputer\u201d with the image hard disk installed. The\ncontainer, just like a computer, can be powered on or off."}, "Learn Docker specific terminologies": "This section lists terms and definitions you should be familiar with before getting deeper into Docker.\n[For further definitions, see the extensive glossary](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/) provided by Docker.\n\n**Container image** : A package with all the dependencies and information needed to create a container.\nAn image includes all the dependencies (such as frameworks) plus deployment and execution\n\n4 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker\n\nconfiguration to be used by a container runtime. Usually, an image derives from multiple base images\nthat are layers stacked on top of each other to form the container\u2019s filesystem. An image is immutable\nonce it has been created.\n\n**Dockerfile** : A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It\u2019s like a batch script,\nthe first line states the base image to begin with and then follow the instructions to install required\nprograms, copy files, and so on, until you get the working environment you need.\n\n**Build** : The action of building a container image based on the information and context provided by its\nDockerfile, plus additional files in the folder where the image is built. You can build images with the\nfollowing Docker command:\n\n```\ndocker build\n\n```\n\n**Container** : An instance of a Docker image. A container represents the execution of a single\napplication, process, or service. It consists of the contents of a Docker image, an execution\nenvironment, and a standard set of instructions. When scaling a service, you create multiple instances\nof a container from the same image. Or a batch job can create multiple containers from the same\nimage, passing different parameters to each instance.\n\n**Volumes** : Offer a writable filesystem that the container can use. Since images are read-only but most\nprograms need to write to the filesystem, volumes add a writable layer, on top of the container image,\nso the programs have access to a writable filesystem. The program doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s accessing a\nlayered filesystem, it\u2019s just the filesystem as usual. Volumes live in the host system and are managed\nby Docker.\n\n**Tag** : A mark or label you can apply to images so that different images or versions of the same image\n(depending on the version number or the target environment) can be identified.\n\n**Multi-stage Build** : Is a feature, since Docker 17.05 or higher, that helps to reduce the size of the final\nimages. For example, a large base image, containing the SDK can be used for compiling and\npublishing and then a small runtime-only base image can be used to host the application.\n\n**Repository (repo)** : A collection of related Docker images, labeled with a tag that indicates the image\nversion. Some repos contain multiple variants of a specific image, such as an image containing SDKs\n(heavier), an image containing only runtimes (lighter), etc. Those variants can be marked with tags. A\nsingle repo can contain platform variants, such as a Linux image and a Windows image.\n\n**Registry** : A service that provides access to repositories. The default registry for most public images is\n[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) (owned by Docker as an organization). A registry usually contains repositories from\nmultiple teams. Companies often have private registries to store and manage images they\u2019ve created.\nAzure Container Registry is another example.\n\n**Multi-arch image** : For multi-architecture, it\u2019s a feature that simplifies the selection of the appropriate\nimage, according to the platform where Docker is running. For example, when a Dockerfile requests a\nbase image **FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0** from the registry, it actually gets **6.0-**\n**nanoserver-20H2**, **6.0-nanoserver-1809** or **6.0-bullseye-slim**, depending on the operating system\nand version where Docker is running.\n\n5 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker\n\n**Docker Hub** : A public registry to upload images and work with them. Docker Hub provides Docker\nimage hosting, public or private registries, build triggers and web hooks, and integration with GitHub\nand Bitbucket.\n\n**Azure Container Registry** : A public resource for working with Docker images and its components in\nAzure. This provides a registry that\u2019s close to your deployments in Azure and that gives you control\nover access, making it possible to use your Azure Active Directory groups and permissions.\n\n**Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)** : A Docker registry service (from Docker) that can be installed onpremises so it lives within the organization\u2019s datacenter and network. It\u2019s convenient for private\nimages that should be managed within the enterprise. Docker Trusted Registry is included as part of\nthe Docker Datacenter product.\n\n**Docker Desktop** : Development tools for Windows and macOS for building, running, and testing\ncontainers locally. Docker Desktop for Windows provides development environments for both Linux\n[and Windows Containers. The Linux Docker host on Windows is based on a Hyper-V virtual machine.](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/server-virtualization)\nThe host for Windows Containers is directly based on Windows. Docker Desktop for Mac is based on\n[the Apple Hypervisor framework and the xhyve hypervisor, which provides a Linux Docker host virtual](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve)\nmachine on macOS. Docker Desktop for Windows and for Mac replaces Docker Toolbox, which was\nbased on Oracle VirtualBox.\n\n**Compose** : A command-line tool and YAML file format with metadata for defining and running multicontainer applications. You define a single application based on multiple images with one or more\n_.yml_ files that can override values depending on the environment. After you\u2019ve created the definitions,\nyou can deploy the whole multi-container application with a single command (docker-compose up)\nthat creates a container per image on the Docker host.\n\n**Cluster** : A collection of Docker hosts exposed as if it were a single virtual Docker host, so that the\napplication can scale to multiple instances of the services spread across multiple hosts within the\ncluster. Docker clusters can be created with Kubernetes, Azure Service Fabric, Docker Swarm and\nMesosphere DC/OS.\n\n**Orchestrator** : A tool that simplifies the management of clusters and Docker hosts. Orchestrators\nenable you to manage their images, containers, and hosts through a command-line interface (CLI) or a\ngraphical UI. You can manage container networking, configurations, load balancing, service discovery,\nhigh availability, Docker host configuration, and more. An orchestrator is responsible for running,\ndistributing, scaling, and healing workloads across a collection of nodes. Typically, orchestrator\nproducts are the same products that provide cluster infrastructure, like Kubernetes and Azure Service\nFabric, among other offerings in the market.", "Learn docker containers, images, and registries": "When using Docker, you create an app or service and package it and its dependencies into a\ncontainer image. An image is a static representation of the app or service and its configuration and\ndependencies.\n\nTo run the app or service, the app\u2019s image is instantiated to create a container, which will be running\non the Docker host. Containers are initially tested in a development environment or PC.\n\n6 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker\n\nYou store images in a registry that acts as a library of images. You need a registry when deploying to\n[production orchestrators. Docker maintains a public registry via Docker Hub; other vendors provide](https://hub.docker.com/)\n[registries for different collections of images, including Azure Container Registry. Alternatively,](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/)\nenterprises can have a private registry on-premises for their own Docker images.\n\nFigure 1-4 shows how images and registries in Docker relate to other components. It also shows the\nmultiple registry offerings from vendors.\n\n_Figure 1-4. Taxonomy of Docker terms and concepts_\n\nThe registry is like a bookshelf where images are stored and available to be pulled for building\ncontainers to run services or web apps. There are private Docker registries on-premises and on the\npublic cloud. Docker Hub is a public registry maintained by Docker, along the Docker Trusted Registry\nan enterprise-grade solution, Azure offers the Azure Container Registry. AWS, Google and others also\nhave container registries.\n\nBy putting images in a registry, you can store static and immutable application bits, including all\nof their dependencies, at a framework level. You then can version and deploy images in multiple\nenvironments and thus provide a consistent deployment unit.\n\n7 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker\n\nPrivate image registries, either hosted on-premises or in the cloud, are recommended when:\n\n['Your images must not be shared publicly due to confidentiality.']\n\n['You want to have minimum network latency between your images and your chosen\\ndeployment environment. For example, if your production environment is Azure, you probably\\n[want to store your images in Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/) so that network latency is minimal. In a\\nsimilar way, if your production environment is on-premises, you might want to have an onpremises Docker Trusted Registry available within the same local network.']", "Road to modern applications based on containers": "You\u2019re probably reading this book because you\u2019re planning the development of new applications or\nyou\u2019re assessing the impact of using Docker, Containers, and new approaches like Microservices in\nyour company.\n\nThe adoption of new development paradigms must be taken with caution before starting a project, to\nassess the impact on your dev teams, your budget, or your infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft has been working on rich guidance, sample applications, and a suite of e-books that can\nhelp you make an informed decision and guide your team through a successful development,\ndeployment, and operations of your new applications.\n\nThis book belongs to a Microsoft suite of guides that cover many of the needs and challenges you\u2019ll\nface during the process of developing new modern applications based on containers.\n\nYou can find additional Microsoft e-books related to Docker containers in the list below:\n\n['**.NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications**\\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/microservices/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/)']\n\n['**Modernize existing .NET applications with Azure cloud and Windows Containers**\\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/modernize-with-azure-containers/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modernize-with-azure-containers/)']\n\n8 CHAPTER 1 | Overview of Containers and Docker\n\n**CHAPTER**"}}, "2": {"Introduction to the Docker application life cycle": {"Containers as the foundation for DevOps collaboration": {"**Challenges in the application life cycle when using Docker.**": "There are many reasons that will increase the number of containerized applications in the upcoming\nyears, and one of these reasons is the creation of applications based on microservices.\n\nDuring the last 15 years, the use of web services has been the base of thousands of applications, and\nprobably, after a few years, you\u2019ll find the same situation with microservice-based applications\nrunning on Docker containers.\n\nIt is also worth to mention that you can also use Docker containers for monolithic applications and\nyou still get most of the benefits of Docker.

High-level workflow for the Docker containerized application life cycle_\n\nEverything begins with the developer, who starts writing code in the inner-loop workflow. The innerloop stage is where developers define everything that happens before pushing code into the code\nrepository (for example, a source control system such as Git). After it\u2019s committed, the repository\ntriggers Continuous Integration (CI) and the rest of the workflow.\n\n11 CHAPTER 2 | Introduction to the Docker application life cycle\n\nThe inner loop consists of typical steps like \u201ccode,\u201d \u201crun,\u201d \u201ctest,\u201d and \u201cdebug,\u201d plus the additional steps\nneeded right before running the app locally. This is the developer\u2019s process to run and test the app as\na Docker container. The inner-loop workflow will be explained in the sections that follow.\n\nTaking a step back to look at the end-to-end workflow, the DevOps workflow is more than a\ntechnology or a tool set, it\u2019s a mindset that requires cultural evolution. It\u2019s people, processes, and the\nappropriate tools to make your application life cycle faster and more predictable. Enterprises that\nadopt a containerized workflow typically restructure their organizations to represent people and\nprocesses that match the containerized workflow.\n\nPracticing DevOps can help teams respond faster together to competitive pressures by replacing\nerror-prone manual processes with automation, which results in improved traceability and repeatable\nworkflows. Organizations also can manage environments more efficiently and realize cost savings with\na combination of on-premises and cloud resources as well as tightly integrated tooling.\n\nWhen implementing your DevOps workflow for Docker applications, you\u2019ll see that Docker\ntechnologies are present in almost every stage of the workflow, from your development box while\nworking in the inner loop (code, run, debug), the build-test-CI phase, and, finally, the deployment of\nthose containers to the staging and production environments.\n\nImprovement of quality practices helps to identify defects early in the development cycle, which\nreduces the cost of fixing them. By including the environment and dependencies in the image and\nadopting a philosophy of deploying the same image across multiple environments, you promote a\ndiscipline of extracting the environment-specific configurations making deployments more reliable.\n\nRich data obtained through effective instrumentation (monitoring and diagnostics) provides insight\ninto performance issues and user behavior to guide future priorities and investments.\n\nDevOps should be considered a journey, not a destination. It should be implemented incrementally\nthrough appropriately scoped projects from which you can demonstrate success, learn, and evolve.", "**Benefits of DevOps for containerized applications**": "Here are some of the most important benefits provided by a solid DevOps workflow:\n\n['Deliver better-quality software, faster and with better compliance.']\n\n['Drive continuous improvement and adjustments earlier and more economically.']\n\n['Increase transparency and collaboration among stakeholders involved in delivering and\\noperating software.']\n\n['Control costs and utilize provisioned resources more effectively while minimizing security\\nrisks.']\n\n['Plug and play well with many of your existing DevOps investments, including investments in\\nopen-source.']\n\n12 CHAPTER 2 | Introduction to the Docker application life cycle\n\n**CHAPTER**"}}}, "3": {"Introduction to the Microsoft platform and tools for containerized apps": "_Vision: Create an adaptable, enterprise-grade, containerized application life cycle that spans your_\n_development, IT operations, and production management._\n\nFigure 3-1 shows the main pillars in the life cycle of Docker apps classified by the type of work\ndelivered by multiple teams (app-development, DevOps infrastructure processes, and IT management\nand operations).

By defining a container as a process\nboundary, you begin to create the primitives used to scale, or batch-off, processes. When you run a\n[Docker container, you\u2019ll see an ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) definition. This defines the process and the lifetime of\nthe container. When the process completes, the container life-cycle ends. There are long-running\nprocesses, such as web servers, and short-lived processes, such as batch jobs, which might have\n[been implemented as Microsoft Azure WebJobs. If the process fails, the container ends, and the](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/wiki)\norchestrator takes over.

Tearing down a Docker container is as easy as invoking the docker\nstop command, typically completing in less than a second.\n\nBecause containers are inherently immutable, by design, you never need to worry about corrupted\nVMs because an update script forgot to account for some specific configuration or file left on disk.\n\nAlthough monolithic apps can benefit from Docker, we\u2019re touching on only the tips of the benefits.\nThe larger benefits of managing containers come from deploying with container orchestrators that\nmanage the various instances and life cycle of each container instance.

If you added a\ndependency to your app, because you\u2019re running it in a container, you get the capability of including\nthose dependencies in your Dockerfile or Docker image.\n\n21 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_Figure 4-4.

A process does not maintain\npersistent state. While a container can write to its local storage, assuming that an instance will be\naround indefinitely is like assuming that a single location in memory will be durable. Container\nimages, like processes, should be assumed to have multiple instances and that they will eventually be\nkilled; if they\u2019re managed with a container orchestrator, it should be assumed that they might get\nmoved from one node or VM to another.\n\nThe following solutions are used to manage persistent data in Docker applications:\n\n[From the Docker host, as Docker Volumes:](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/)\n\n['**Volumes** are stored in an area of the host filesystem that\u2019s managed by Docker.']\n\n['**Bind mounts** can map to any folder in the host filesystem, so access can\u2019t be controlled from\\na Docker process and can pose a security risk as a container could access sensitive OS folders.']\n\n22 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n['**tmpfs mounts** are like virtual folders that only exist in the host\u2019s memory and are never\\nwritten to the filesystem.']\n\nFrom remote storage:\n\n['[Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/storage/) provides geo-distributable storage, providing a good long-term persistence\\nsolution for containers.']\n\n['[Remote relational databases like Azure SQL Database, NoSQL databases like Azure Cosmos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)\\n[DB, or cache services like Redis.](https://redis.io/)']\n\nFrom the Docker container:\n\n['Docker provides a feature named the _overlay file system_ . This feature implements a copy-onwrite task that stores updated information to the root file system of the container. That\\ninformation \u201clays on top of\u201d the original image on which the container is based. If the\\ncontainer is deleted from the system, those changes are lost. Therefore, while it\u2019s possible to\\nsave the state of a container within its local storage, designing a system based on this feature\\nwould conflict with the premise of container design, which by default is stateless.']\n\n['However, Docker Volumes is now the preferred way to handle local data in Docker. If you\\n[need more information about storage in containers, check on Docker storage drivers and](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/)\\n[About images, containers, and storage drivers.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/)']\n\nThe following provides additional detail about these options.\n\n**Volumes** are directories mapped from the host OS to directories in containers. When code in the\ncontainer has access to the directory, that access is actually to a directory on the host OS. This\ndirectory is not tied to the lifetime of the container itself, and the directory is managed by Docker and\nisolated from the core functionality of the host machine. Thus, data volumes are designed to persist\ndata independently of the life of the container. If you delete a container or an image from the Docker\nhost, the data persisted in the data volume is not deleted.\n\nVolumes can be named or anonymous (the default). Named volumes are the evolution of **Data**\n**Volume Containers** and make it easy to share data between containers. Volumes also support\nvolume drivers that allow you to store data on remote hosts, among other options.\n\n**Bind mounts** have been available for a long time and allow the mapping of any folder to a mount\npoint in a container. Bind mounts have more limitations than volumes and some important security\nissues, so volumes are the recommended option.\n\n**tmpfs mounts** are virtual folders that live only in the host\u2019s memory and are never written to the\nfilesystem. They are fast and secure but use memory and are only meant for non-persistent data.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4-5, regular Docker volumes can be stored outside of the containers themselves\nbut within the physical boundaries of the host server or VM. However, Docker containers cannot\naccess a volume from one host server or VM to another. In other words, with these volumes, it isn\u2019t\npossible to manage data shared between containers that run on different Docker hosts, although it\ncould be achieved with a volume driver that supports remote hosts.\n\n23 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_Figure 4-5. Volumes and external data sources for container-based applications_\n\nIn addition, when Docker containers are managed by an orchestrator, containers might \u201cmove\u201d\nbetween hosts, depending on the optimizations performed by the cluster. Therefore, it isn\u2019t\nrecommended that you use data volumes for business data. But they are a good mechanism to work\nwith trace files, temporal files, or similar, that will not impact business data consistency.\n\n**Remote data sources and cache** tools like Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, or a remote cache\nlike Redis can be used in containerized applications the same way they are used when developing\nwithout containers. This is a proven way to store business application data.\n\n**Azure Storage.** Business data usually needs to be placed in external resources or databases, like\nAzure Storage. Azure Storage provides the following services in the cloud:\n\n['Blob storage stores unstructured object data. A blob can be any type of text or binary data,\\nsuch as document or media files (images, audio, and video files). Blob storage is also referred\\nto as Object storage.']\n\n['File storage offers shared storage for legacy applications using the standard SMB protocol.\\nAzure virtual machines and cloud services can share file data across application components\\nvia mounted shares. On-premises applications can access file data in a share via the File\\nService REST API.']\n\n['Table storage stores structured datasets. Table storage is a NoSQL key-attribute data store,\\nwhich allows rapid development and fast access to large quantities of data.']\n\n**Relational databases and NoSQL databases.** There are many choices for external databases, from\nrelational databases like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or NoSQL databases like Azure Cosmos DB,\nMongoDB, etc. These databases are not going to be explained as part of this guide since they are a\ndifferent topic altogether.\n\n24 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure", "Service-oriented applications": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) was an overused term that meant many different things to\ndifferent people. But as a common denominator, SOA means that you structure the architecture of\nyour application by decomposing it into several services (most commonly as HTTP services) that can\nbe classified in different types like subsystems or, in other cases, as tiers.\n\nToday, you can deploy those services as Docker containers, which solve deployment-related issues\nbecause all of the dependencies are included in the container image. However, when you need to\nscale out SOAs, you might encounter challenges if you\u2019re deploying based on single instances. This\nchallenge can be handled using Docker clustering software or an orchestrator. You\u2019ll get to look at\norchestrators in greater detail in the next section, when you explore microservices approaches.\n\nDocker containers are useful (but not required) for both traditional service-oriented architectures and\nthe more advanced microservices architectures.\n\nAt the end of the day, the container clustering solutions are useful for both a traditional SOA\narchitecture and for a more advanced microservices architecture in which each microservice owns its\ndata model. And thanks to multiple databases, you can also scale out the data tier instead of working\nwith monolithic databases shared by the SOA services.

The experience of building and operating large\nservices at scale, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, or Cortana\u2019s\nBackend, shaped Service Fabric. The platform evolved over time as more and more services adopted\nit. Importantly, Service Fabric had to run not only in Azure but also in standalone Windows Server\ndeployments.\n\nThe aim of Service Fabric is to solve the hard problems of building and running a service and utilizing\ninfrastructure resources efficiently, so that teams can solve business problems using a microservices\napproach.\n\nService Fabric provides two broad areas to help you build applications that use a microservices\napproach:\n\n['A platform that provides system services to deploy, scale, upgrade, detect, and restart failed\\nservices, discover service location, manage state, and monitor health.

This way you can get health and diagnostics information, or you can take advantage of\\nreliable state management.']\n\nService Fabric is agnostic with respect to how you build your service, and you can use any technology.\nHowever, it provides built-in programming APIs that make it easier to build microservices.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4-10, you can create and run microservices in Service Fabric either as simple\nprocesses or as Docker containers. It\u2019s also possible to mix container-based microservices with\nprocess-based microservices within the same Service Fabric cluster.\n\n32 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_Figure 4-10. Deploying microservices as processes or as containers in Azure Service Fabric_\n\nIn the first image, you see microservices as processes, where each node runs one process for each\nmicroservice. In the second image, you see microservices as containers, where each node runs Docker\nwith several containers, one container per microservice. Service Fabric clusters based on Linux and\nWindows hosts can run Docker Linux containers and Windows Containers, respectively.\n\n[For up-to-date information about containers support in Azure Service Fabric, see Service Fabric and](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-containers-overview)\n[containers.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-containers-overview)\n\nService Fabric is a good example of a platform where you can define a different logical architecture\n(business microservices or Bounded Contexts) than the physical implementation. For example, if you\n[implement Stateful Reliable Services in Azure Service Fabric, which are introduced in the next section,](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction)\n\u201cStateless versus stateful microservices,\u201d you have a business microservice concept with multiple\nphysical services.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4-10, and thinking from a logical/business microservice perspective, when\nimplementing a Service Fabric Stateful Reliable Service, you usually will need to implement two tiers\nof services. The first is the back-end stateful reliable service, which handles multiple partitions (each\npartition is a stateful service). The second is the front-end service, or Gateway service, in charge of\nrouting and data aggregation across multiple partitions or stateful service instances. That Gateway\nservice also handles client-side communication with retry loops accessing the back-end service. It\u2019s\ncalled a Gateway service if you implement your custom service, or alternatively you can also use the\n[out-of-the-box Service Fabric reverse proxy.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reverseproxy)\n\n33 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_Figure 4-11. Business microservice with several stateful service instances and a custom gateway front end_\n\nIn any case, when you use Service Fabric Stateful Reliable Services, you also have a logical or business\nmicroservice (Bounded Context) that\u2019s composed of multiple physical services. Each of them, the\nGateway service, and Partition service could be implemented as ASP.NET Web API services, as shown\nin Figure 4-11. Service Fabric has prescription to support several stateful reliable services in containers.\n\n[In Service Fabric, you can group and deploy groups of services as a Service Fabric Application, which is](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-model)\nthe unit of packaging and deployment for the orchestrator or cluster. Therefore, the Service Fabric\nApplication could be mapped to this autonomous business and logical microservice boundary or\nBounded Context, as well, so you could deploy these services autonomously.\n\n**Service Fabric and containers**\n\nWith regard to containers in Service Fabric, you can also deploy services in container images within a\nService Fabric cluster. As Figure 4-12 shows, most of the time there will only be one container per\nservice.\n\n_Figure 4-12. Business microservice with several services (containers) in Service Fabric_\n\n34 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\nA Service Fabric application can run several containers accessing an external database and the whole\nset would be the logical boundary of a Business Microservice. However, so-called \u201csidecar\u201d containers\n(two containers that must be deployed together as part of a logical service) are also possible in\nService Fabric. The important thing is that a business microservice is the logical boundary around\nseveral cohesive elements. In many cases, it might be a single service with a single data model, but in\nsome other cases you might have several physical services as well.\n\nNote that you can mix services in processes, and services in containers, in the same Service Fabric\napplication, as shown in Figure 4-13.\n\n_Figure 4-13. Business microservice mapped to a Service Fabric application with containers and stateful services_\n\n[For more information about container support in Azure Service Fabric, see Service Fabric and](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-containers-overview)\n[containers.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-containers-overview)", "**Stateless versus stateful microservices**": "As mentioned earlier, each microservice (logical Bounded Context) must own its domain model (data\nand logic). In the case of stateless microservices, the databases will be external, employing relational\noptions like SQL Server, or NoSQL options like Azure Cosmos DB or MongoDB.\n\nBut the services themselves can also be stateful in Service Fabric, which means that the data resides\nwithin the microservice. This data might exist not just on the same server, but within the microservice\nprocess, in memory and persisted on hard drives and replicated to other nodes. Figure 4-14 shows the\ndifferent approaches.\n\n35 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_Figure 4-14. Stateless versus stateful microservices_\n\nIn stateless services, the state (persistence, database) is kept out of the microservice. In stateful\nservices, state is kept inside the microservice. A stateless approach is perfectly valid and is easier to\nimplement than stateful microservices, since the approach is similar to traditional and well-known\npatterns. But stateless microservices impose latency between the process and data sources. They also\ninvolve more moving pieces when you\u2019re trying to improve performance with additional cache and\nqueues. The result is that you can end up with complex architectures that have too many tiers.\n\n[In contrast, stateful microservices can excel in advanced scenarios, because there\u2019s no latency between](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction#when-to-use-reliable-services-apis)\nthe domain logic and data. Heavy data processing, gaming back ends, databases as a service, and\nother low-latency scenarios all benefit from stateful services, which enable local state for faster access.\n\nStateless and stateful services are complementary. For instance, as you can see in the right diagram in\nFigure 4-14, a stateful service can be split into multiple partitions. To access those partitions, you\nmight need a stateless service acting as a gateway service that knows how to address each partition\nbased on partition keys.\n\nStateful services do have drawbacks. They impose a high complexity level to be scaled out.\nFunctionality that would usually be implemented by external database systems must be addressed for\ntasks such as data replication across stateful microservices and data partitioning. However, this is one\n[of the areas where an orchestrator like Azure Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-platform-architecture) [with its stateful reliable services can help](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction#when-to-use-reliable-services-apis)\n[the most\u2014by simplifying the development and lifecycle of stateful microservices using the Reliable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-work-with-reliable-collections)\n[Services API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-work-with-reliable-collections) [and Reliable Actors.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction)\n\nOther microservice frameworks that allow stateful services, support the Actor pattern, and improve\n[fault tolerance and latency between business logic and data are Microsoft Orleans, from Microsoft](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans)\n[Research, and Akka.NET.

Press F5 to debug your application (single container or multiple containers) directly in a\nDocker host, or press Ctrl+F5 to edit and refresh your app without having to rebuild the container. It\u2019s\nthe simplest and most powerful choice for Windows developers to create Docker containers for Linux\nor Windows.\n\n40 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n**Visual Studio for Mac (Mac development machine)**\n\n[You can use Visual Studio for Mac when developing Docker-based applications. Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=learn.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link)\noffers a richer IDE when compared to Visual Studio Code for Mac.", "**Language and framework choices**": "You can develop Docker applications using Microsoft tools with most modern languages. The\nfollowing is an initial list, but you\u2019re not limited to it:\n\n['.NET and ASP.NET Core', 'Node.js', 'Go', 'Java', 'Ruby', 'Python']\n\nBasically, you can use any modern language supported by Docker in Linux or Windows."}, "Inner-loop development workflow for Docker apps": {"**Building a single app within a Docker container using Visual Studio** **Code and Docker CLI**": "Apps are made up from your own services plus additional libraries (dependencies).\n\nFigure 4-22 shows the basic steps that you usually need to carry out when building a Docker app,\nfollowed by detailed descriptions of each step.\n\n_Figure 4-22. High-level workflow for the life cycle for Docker containerized applications using Docker CLI_\n\n**Step 1: Start coding in Visual Studio Code and create your initial app/service**\n**baseline**\n\nThe way you develop your application is similar to the way you do it without Docker. The difference is\nthat while developing, you\u2019re deploying and testing your application or services running within Docker\ncontainers placed in your local environment (like a Linux VM or Windows).\n\n**Setting up your local environment**\n\nWith the latest versions of Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows, it\u2019s easier than ever to develop\nDocker applications, and the setup is straightforward.\n\nIn addition, you\u2019ll need a code editor so that you can actually develop your application while using\nDocker CLI.\n\n42 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\nMicrosoft provides Visual Studio Code, which is a lightweight code editor that\u2019s supported on\n[Windows, Linux, and macOS, and provides IntelliSense with support for many languages (JavaScript,](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview)\n[.NET, Go, Java, Ruby, Python, and most modern languages), debugging,](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging) [integration with Git and](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/versioncontrol)\n[extensions support. This editor is a great fit for macOS and Linux developers. In Windows, you also](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/overview)\ncan use Visual Studio.\n\nYou can work with Docker CLI and write your code using any code editor, but using Visual Studio\nCode with the Docker extension makes it easy to author Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files in\nyour workspace. You can also run tasks and scripts from the Visual Studio Code IDE to execute Docker\ncommands using the Docker CLI underneath.\n\nThe Docker extension for VS Code provides the following features:\n\n['Automatic Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file generation']\n\n['Syntax highlighting and hover tips for docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile files']\n\n['IntelliSense (completions) for Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files']\n\n['Linting (errors and warnings) for Dockerfile files']\n\n['Command Palette (F1) integration for the most common Docker commands']\n\n['Explorer integration for managing Images and Containers']\n\n['Deploy images from DockerHub and Azure Container Registries to Azure App Service']\n\nTo install the Docker extension, press Ctrl+Shift+P, type ext install, and then run the Install Extension\ncommand to bring up the Marketplace extension list. Next, type **docker** to filter the results, and then\nselect the Docker Support extension, as depicted in Figure 4-23.\n\n_Figure 4-23. Installing the Docker Extension in Visual Studio Code_\n\n43 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n**Step 2: Create a DockerFile related to an existing image (plain OS or dev**\n**environments like .NET, Node.js, and Ruby)**\n\nYou\u2019ll need a DockerFile per custom image to be built and per container to be deployed. If your app is\nmade up of single custom service, you\u2019ll need a single DockerFile. But if your app is composed of\nmultiple services (as in a microservices architecture), you\u2019ll need one Dockerfile per service.\n\nThe DockerFile is commonly placed in the root folder of your app or service and contains the required\ncommands so that Docker knows how to set up and run that app or service. You can create your\nDockerFile and add it to your project along with your code (node.js, .NET, etc.), or, if you\u2019re new to the\nenvironment, take a look at the following Tip.\n\nIn Figure 4-24, you can see the steps to add the docker files to a project by using the Docker\nExtension for VS Code:\n\n['Open the command palette, type \u201c **docker** \u201d and select \u201c **Add Docker Files to Workspace** \u201d.', 'Select Application Platform (ASP.NET Core)', 'Select Operating System (Linux)', 'Include optional Docker Compose files', 'Enter ports to publish (80, 443)', 'Select the project']\n\n44 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_Figure 4-24. Docker files added using the Add Docker files to Workspace command_\n\nWhen you add a DockerFile, you specify what base Docker image you\u2019ll be using (like using FROM\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet). You\u2019ll usually build your custom image on top of a base image\n[that you get from any official repository at the Docker Hub registry](https://hub.docker.com/) [(like an image for .NET or the one](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet/)\n[for Node.js).](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/)\n\n_**Use an existing official Docker image**_\n\nUsing an official repository of a language stack with a version number ensures that the same language\nfeatures are available on all machines (including development, testing, and production).\n\nThe following is a sample DockerFile for a .NET container:\n\n45 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\nIn this case, the image is based on version 6.0 of the official ASP.NET Core Docker image (multi-arch\nfor Linux and Windows), as per the line FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0. (For more\n[information about this topic, see the ASP.NET Core Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet/) [page and the .NET Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet/)\npage).\n\nIn the DockerFile, you can also instruct Docker to listen to the TCP port that you\u2019ll use at run time\n(such as port 80 or 443).\n\nYou can specify additional configuration settings in the Dockerfile, depending on the language and\nframework you\u2019re using. For instance, the ENTRYPOINT line with [\"dotnet\", \"WebMvcApplication.dll\"]\ntells Docker to run a .NET application. If you\u2019re using the SDK and the .NET CLI (dotnet CLI) to build\nand run the .NET application, this setting would be different. The key point here is that the\nENTRYPOINT line and other settings depend on the language and platform you choose for your\napplication.\n\n**Use multi-arch image repositories**\n\nA single image name in a repo can contain platform variants, such as a Linux image and a Windows\nimage. This feature allows vendors like Microsoft (base image creators) to create a single repo to\n[cover multiple platforms (that is, Linux and Windows). For example, the dotnet/aspnet repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet/)\navailable in the Docker Hub registry provides support for Linux and Windows Nano Server by using\nthe same image name.\n\n[Pulling the dotnet/aspnet image from a Windows host pulls the Windows variant, whereas pulling the](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet/)\nsame image name from a Linux host pulls the Linux variant.\n\n46 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_**Create your base image from scratch**_\n\n[You can create your own Docker base image from scratch as explained in this article from Docker. This](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/baseimages/)\nscenario is probably not the best for you if you\u2019re just starting with Docker, but if you want to set the\nspecific bits of your own base image, you can do it.\n\n**Step 3: Create your custom Docker images embedding your service in it**\n\nFor each custom service that comprises your app, you\u2019ll need to create a related image. If your app is\nmade up of a single service or web app, you\u2019ll need just a single image.\n\nTo create an image in your local environment and using the DockerFile, you can use the docker build\ncommand, as shown in Figure 4-25, because it already tags the image for you and builds the images\nfor all services in the application with a simple command.\n\n_Figure 4-25. Running docker build_\n\nOptionally, instead of directly running docker build from the project folder, you first can generate a\ndeployable folder with the .NET libraries needed by using the run dotnet publish command, and then\nrun docker build.\n\nThis example creates a Docker image with the name webapi:latest (:latest is a tag, like a specific\nversion). You can take this step for each custom image you need to create for your composed Docker\n\n47 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\napplication with several containers. However, we\u2019ll see in the next section that it\u2019s easier to do this\nusing docker-compose.\n\nYou can find the existing images in your local repository (your development machine) by using the\ndocker images command, as illustrated in Figure 4-26.\n\n_Figure 4-26. Viewing existing images using docker images_\n\n**Step 4: Define your services in docker-compose.yml when building a composed**\n**Docker app with multiple services**\n\nWith the docker-compose.yml file, you can define a set of related services to be deployed as a\ncomposed application with the deployment commands explained in the next step section.\n\nCreate that file in your main or root solution folder; it should have content similar to that shown in this\ndocker-compose.yml file:\n\nIn this particular case, this file defines three services: the web API service (your custom service), a web\napplication, and the Redis service (a popular cache service). Each service will be deployed as a\ncontainer, so you need to use a concrete Docker image for each. For this particular application:\n\n48 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n['The web API service is built from the DockerFile in the src/WebApi/Dockerfile directory.']\n\n['The host port 51080 is forwarded to the exposed port 80 on the webapi container.']\n\n['The web API service depends on the Redis service']\n\n['The web application accesses the web API service using the internal address: http://webapi.']\n\n['[The Redis service uses the latest public redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/)\\n[Redis](https://redis.io/) is a popular cache system for server-side applications.']\n\n**Step 5: Build and run your Docker app**\n\nIf your app has only a single container, you just need to run it by deploying it to your Docker Host\n(VM or physical server). However, if your app is made up of multiple services, you need to _compose it_,\ntoo. Let\u2019s see the different options.\n\n_**Option A: Run a single container or service**_\n\nYou can run the Docker image by using the docker run command, as shown here:\n\n```\ndocker run -t -d -p 50080:80 webapp:latest\n\n```\n\nFor this particular deployment, we\u2019ll be redirecting requests sent to port 50080 on the host to the\ninternal port 80.\n\n_**Option B: Compose and run a multiple-container application**_\n\nIn most enterprise scenarios, a Docker application will be composed of multiple services. For these\ncases, you can run the docker-compose up command (Figure 4-27), which will use the dockercompose.yml file that you created previously. Running this command builds all custom images and\ndeploys the composed application with all of its related containers.\n\n49 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_Figure 4-27. Results of running the \u201cdocker-compose up\u201d command_\n\nAfter you run docker-compose up, you deploy your application and its related container(s) into your\nDocker Host, as illustrated in Figure 4-28, in the VM representation.\n\n_Figure 4-28. VM with Docker containers deployed_\n\n**Step 6: Test your Docker application (locally, in your local CD VM)**\n\nThis step will vary depending on what your app is doing.\n\nIn a simple .NET Web API \u201cHello World\u201d deployed as a single container or service, you\u2019d just need to\naccess the service by providing the TCP port specified in the DockerFile.\n\nOn the Docker host, open a browser and navigate to that site; you should see your app/service\nrunning, as demonstrated in Figure 4-29.\n\n50 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_Figure 4-29. Testing your Docker application locally by using the browser_\n\nNote that it\u2019s using port 50080, but internally it\u2019s being redirected to port 80, because that\u2019s how it\nwas deployed with docker compose, as explained earlier.\n\nYou can test this by using the browser using CURL from the terminal, as depicted in Figure 4-30.\n\n_Figure 4-30. Testing a Docker application locally by using CURL_\n\n**Debugging a container running on Docker**\n\nVisual Studio Code supports debugging Docker if you\u2019re using Node.js and other platforms like .NET\ncontainers.\n\n51 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\nYou also can debug .NET or .NET Framework containers in Docker when using Visual Studio for\nWindows or Mac, as described in the next section."}, "Use Docker Tools in Visual Studio on Windows": {"**Configure your local environment**": "With the latest versions of Docker for Windows, it\u2019s easier than ever to develop Docker applications\nbecause the setup is straightforward, as explained in the following references.", "**Docker support in Visual Studio**": "There are two levels of Docker support you can add to a project. In ASP.NET Core projects, you can\njust add a Dockerfile file to the project by enabling Docker support. The next level is container\norchestration support, which adds a Dockerfile to the project (if it doesn\u2019t already exist) and a dockercompose.yml file at the solution level. Container orchestration support, via Docker Compose, is\navailable in Visual Studio 2022 versions 17.0. Container orchestration support is an opt-in feature in\nVisual Studio 2022 versions 17.0 or later. Visual Studio 2022 also supports **Kubernetes/Helm**\ndeployment.\n\nThe **Add > Docker Support** and **Add > Container Orchestrator Support** commands are located on\nthe right-click menu (or context menu) of the project node for an ASP.NET Core project in **Solution**\n**Explorer**, as shown in Figure 4-31:\n\n52 CHAPTER 4 | Designing and developing containerized apps using Docker and Microsoft Azure\n\n_Figure 4-31.

However,\nyou can also manage your code in external repositories (like GitHub, on-premises Git repositories, or\nSubversion) and still be able to connect to it and get the code as the starting point for your DevOps CI\npipeline. You can also use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.", "**Step 3: Build, CI, Integrate, and Test with Azure DevOps** **Services/GitHub and Docker**": "CI has emerged as a standard for modern software testing and delivery. The Docker solution\nmaintains a clear separation of concerns between the development and operations teams. The\nimmutability of Docker images ensures a repeatable deployment between what\u2019s developed, tested\nthrough CI, and run in production. Docker Engine deployed across the developer laptops and test\ninfrastructure makes the containers portable across environments.\n\nAt this point, after you have a version-control system with the correct code submitted, you need a\n_build service_ to pick up the code and run the global build and tests.\n\nThe internal workflow for this step (CI, build, test) is about the construction of a CI pipeline consisting\nof your code repository (Git, etc.), your build server (Azure DevOps Services/GitHub), Docker Engine,\nand a Docker Registry.\n\nYou can use Azure DevOps Services as the foundation for building your applications and setting your\nCI pipeline, and for publishing the built \u201cartifacts\u201d to an \u201cartifacts repository,\u201d which is explained in the\nnext step. Alternatively, you can use GitHub to implement the same workflow.\n\n76 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\nWhen using Docker for the deployment, the \u201cfinal artifacts\u201d to be deployed are Docker images with\nyour application or services embedded within them. Those images are pushed or published to a\n_Docker Registry_ (a private repository like the ones you can have in Azure Container Registry, or a\npublic one like Docker Hub Registry or GitHub Container Registry, which is commonly used for official\nbase images).\n\nHere is the basic concept: The CI pipeline will be kicked-off by a commit to an SCC repository like Git.\nThe commit will cause Azure DevOps Services/GitHub to run a build job within a Docker container\nand, upon successful completion of that job, push a Docker image to the Docker Registry, as\nillustrated in Figure 5-2. The first part of the outer loop involves steps 1 to 3, from code, run, debug\nand validate, then the code repo up to the build and test CI step.\n\n_Figure 5-2. The steps involved in CI_\n\nHere are the basic CI workflow steps with Docker and Azure DevOps Services:\n\n77 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\n['The developer pushes a commit to an SCC repository (Git/Azure DevOps Services, GitHub,\\netc.).']\n\n['If you\u2019re using Azure DevOps Services or Git, CI is built in, which means that it\u2019s as simple as\\nselecting a check box in Azure DevOps Services.

It also adds a\nDocker Compose task that you can use to build, push, and run multi-container Docker applications, or\nrun other operations offered by the Docker Compose CLI, as shown in Figure 5-3.\n\n78 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\n_Figure 5-3. The Docker CI pipeline in Azure DevOps Services including Build & Release Templates and associated tasks._\n\nYou can use these templates and tasks to construct your CI/CD artifacts to Build / Test and Deploy in\nAzure Service Fabric, Azure Kubernetes Service, and similar offerings.\n\nWith these Visual Studio Team Services tasks, a build Linux-Docker Host/VM provisioned in Azure and\nyour preferred Docker registry (Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, private Docker DTR, or any\nother Docker registry) you can assemble your Docker CI pipeline in a very consistent way.\n\n_**Requirements:**_\n\n['Azure DevOps Services, or for on-premises installations, Team Foundation Server 2015\\nUpdate 3 or later.']\n\n['An Azure DevOps Services agent that has the Docker binaries.']\n\nAn easy way to create one of these agents is to use Docker to run a container based on the\nAzure DevOps Services agent Docker image.\n\n79 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\n**Implement a CI pipeline with GitHub Actions**\n\nGitHub Actions allow you to create automation scripts that can build Docker images, push Docker\nimages to an authenticated Docker registry, run Docker images, or run other operations offered by\nthe Docker CLI.\n\n[You can use public Actions (such as Azure Login) and run (shell) commands to construct your CI/CD](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login)\nartifacts to Build / Test and Deploy in Azure Service Fabric, Azure Kubernetes Service, and similar\nofferings.\n\nWith these Actions, a build Linux-Docker Host/VM provisioned in Azure and your preferred Docker\nregistry (Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, private Docker DTR, or any other Docker registry) you\ncan assemble your Docker CI pipeline in a very consistent way.\n\n**Integrate, test, and validate multi-container Docker applications**\n\nTypically, most Docker applications are composed of multiple containers rather than a single\ncontainer. A good example is a microservices-oriented application for which you would have one\ncontainer per microservice. But, even without strictly following the microservices approach patterns,\nit\u2019s probable that your Docker application would be composed of multiple containers or services.\n\nTherefore, after building the application containers in the CI pipeline, you also need to deploy,\nintegrate, and test the application as a whole with all of its containers within an integration Docker\nhost or even into a test cluster to which your containers are distributed.\n\nIf you\u2019re using a single host, you can use Docker commands such as docker-compose to build and\ndeploy related containers to test and validate the Docker environment in a single VM. But, if you\u2019re\nworking with an orchestrator cluster like DC/OS, Kubernetes, or Docker Swarm, you need to deploy\nyour containers through a different mechanism or orchestrator, depending on your selected\ncluster/scheduler.\n\nThe following are several types of tests that you can run against Docker containers:\n\n['Unit tests for Docker containers']\n\n['Testing groups of interrelated applications or microservices']\n\n['Test in production and \u201ccanary\u201d releases']\n\nThe important point is that when running integration and functional tests, you must run those tests\nfrom outside of the containers. Tests are not contained or run in the containers you\u2019re deploying,\nbecause the containers are based on static images that should be exactly like the ones you\u2019ll be\ndeploying to production.\n\n80 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\nA practical option when testing more advanced scenarios, like including several clusters (test cluster,\nstaging cluster, and production cluster) is to publish the images to a registry, so it can be tested in\nvarious clusters.\n\n**Push the custom application Docker image into your global Docker Registry**\n\nAfter the Docker images have been tested and validated, you\u2019ll want to tag and publish them to your\nDocker registry. The Docker registry is a critical piece in the Docker application life cycle because it\u2019s\nthe central place where you store your custom test (also known as \u201cblessed images\u201d) to be deployed\ninto QA and production environments.\n\nSimilar to how the application code stored in your SCC repository (Git, etc.) is your \u201csource of truth,\u201d\nthe Docker registry is your \u201csource of truth\u201d for your binary application or bits to be deployed to the\nQA or production environments.\n\nTypically, you might want to have your private repositories for your custom images either in a private\nrepository in Azure Container Registry or in an on-premises registry like Docker Trusted Registry, or in\na public-cloud registry with restricted access (like Docker Hub), although in this last case if your code\nis not open source, you must trust the vendor\u2019s security. Either way, the method you use is similar and\nis based on the docker push command, as shown in Figure 5-4.\n\n81 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\n_Figure 5-4. Publishing custom images to Docker Registry_\n\n82 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\nIn step 3, for building integration and testing (CI) you might publish the resulting docker images to a\nprivate or public registry. There are multiple offerings of Docker registries from cloud vendors like\nAzure Container Registry, Amazon Web Services Container Registry, Google Container Registry,\nGitHub Container Registry, Quay Registry, and so on.\n\nUsing the Docker tasks, you can push a set of service images defined by a docker-compose.yml file,\nwith multiple tags, to an authenticated Docker registry (like Azure Container Registry), as shown in\nFigure 5-5.\n\n_Figure 5-5. Using Azure DevOps Services to publishing custom images to a Docker Registry_", "**Step 4: CD, Deploy**": "The immutability of Docker images ensures a repeatable deployment with what\u2019s developed, tested\nthrough CI, and run in production. After you have the application Docker images published in your\nDocker registry (either private or public), you can deploy them to the several environments that you\nmight have (production, QA, staging, etc.) from your CD pipeline by using Azure DevOps Services\npipeline tasks, Azure DevOps Services Release Management or GitHub Actions.\n\n83 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\nHowever, at this point it depends on what kind of Docker application you\u2019re deploying. Deploying a\nsimple application (from a composition and deployment point of view) like a monolithic application\ncomprising a few containers or services and deployed to a few servers or VMs is different from\ndeploying a more complex application like a microservices-oriented application with hyperscale\ncapabilities. These two scenarios are explained in the following sections.\n\n**Deploying composed Docker applications to multiple Docker environments**\n\nLet\u2019s look first at the less-complex scenario: deploying to simple Docker hosts (VMs or servers) in a\nsingle environment or multiple environments (QA, staging, and production). In this scenario, internally\nyour CD pipeline can use docker-compose (from your Azure DevOps Services deployment tasks) to\ndeploy the Docker applications with its related set of containers or services, as illustrated in Figure 5-6.\n\n_Figure 5-6. Deploying application containers to simple Docker host environments registry_\n\nFigure 5-7 highlights how you can connect your build CI to QA/test environments via Azure DevOps\nServices by clicking Docker Compose in the Add Task dialog box. However, when deploying to staging\nor production environments, you would usually use Release Management features handling multiple\nenvironments (like QA, staging, and production). If you\u2019re deploying to single Docker hosts, it is using\nthe Azure DevOps Services \u201cDocker Compose\u201d task (which is invoking the docker-compose up\ncommand under the hood). If you\u2019re deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), it uses the Docker\n\n84 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\nDeployment task, as explained in the section that follows. Similar steps can be built for deployment\nusing GitHub Actions.\n\n_Figure 5-7. Adding a Docker Compose task in an Azure DevOps Services pipeline or GitHub workflow_\n\nWhen you create a release in Azure DevOps Services, it takes a set of input artifacts. These artifacts are\nintended to be immutable for the lifetime of the release, across all environments. When you introduce\ncontainers, the input artifacts identify images in a registry to deploy. Depending on how these images\nare identified, they are not guaranteed to remain the same throughout the duration of the release, the\nmost obvious case being when you reference myimage:latest from a docker-compose file.\n\nThe Azure DevOps Services templates give you the ability to generate build artifacts that contain\nspecific registry image digests that are guaranteed to uniquely identify the same image binary. These\nare what you really want to use as input to a release. You can invoke docker-compose in a run step\ninside GitHub Actions to accomplish the same goal.\n\n**Managing releases to Docker environments by using Azure DevOps Services**\n**Release Management or GitHub Actions**\n\nThrough the Azure DevOps Services templates, you can build a new image, publish it to a Docker\nregistry, run it on Linux or Windows hosts, and use commands such as docker-compose to deploy\nmultiple containers as an entire application, all through the Azure DevOps Services Release\nManagement capabilities intended for multiple environments, as shown in Figure 5-8.\n\n85 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\n_Figure 5-8. Configuring Azure DevOps Services Docker Compose tasks from Azure DevOps Services Release_\n_Management_\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the scenario shown in Figure 5-6 and implemented in Figure 5-8 is a\nsimple one (it\u2019s deploying to single Docker hosts and VMs, and there will be a single container or\ninstance per image) and probably should be used only for development or test scenarios. In most\nenterprise production scenarios, you would want to have High Availability (HA) and easy-to-manage\nscalability by load balancing across multiple nodes, servers, and VMs, plus \u201cintelligent failovers\u201d so if a\nserver or node fails, its services and containers will be moved to another host server or VM. In that\ncase, you need more advanced technologies such as container clusters, orchestrators, and schedulers.\nThus, the way to deploy to those clusters is by handling the advanced scenarios explained in the next\nsection.\n\n[GitHub Actions can be used in the same manner, including the use of environments for approvals.](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/environments)\n\n**Deploying Docker applications to Docker clusters**\n\nThe nature of distributed applications requires compute resources that are also distributed. To have\nproduction-scale capabilities, you need to have clustering capabilities that provide high scalability and\nhigh availability based on pooled resources.\n\nYou could deploy containers manually to those clusters from a CLI tool or a web UI, but you should\nreserve that kind of manual work to spot deployment testing or management purposes like scalingout or monitoring.\n\nFrom a CD point of view, you can use Azure DevOps Services or GitHub Actions to run specially made\ndeployment tasks from your environments that will deploy your containerized applications to\ndistributed clusters in Container Service, as illustrated in Figure 5-9.\n\n86 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\n_Figure 5-9. Deploying distributed applications to Container Service_\n\nInitially, when deploying to certain clusters or orchestrators, you would traditionally use specific\ndeployment scripts and mechanisms per each orchestrator (that is, Kubernetes and Service Fabric\nhave different deployment mechanisms) instead of the simpler and easy-to-use docker-compose tool\nbased on the docker-compose.yml definition file. However, thanks to the Azure DevOps Services\nDocker Deploy task, shown in Figure 5-10, now you can also deploy to the supported orchestrators by\njust using your familiar docker-compose.yml file because the tool performs that \u201ctranslation\u201d for you\n(from your docker-compose.yml file to the format needed by the orchestrator).\n\n87 CHAPTER 5 | Docker application DevOps workflow with Microsoft tools\n\n_Figure 5-10. Adding the Deploy to Kubernetes task to your Environment_\n\nFigure 5-11 demonstrates how you can edit the Deploy to Kubernetes task with the sections available\nfor configuration. This is the task that will retrieve your ready-to-use custom Docker images to be\ndeployed as containers in the cluster.\n\n_Figure 5-11.
