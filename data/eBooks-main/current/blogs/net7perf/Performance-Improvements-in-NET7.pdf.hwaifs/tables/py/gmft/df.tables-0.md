|  0 | commenter cited the Die Hard movie quote, “‘When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, wept for there were no more worlds to conquer’,” and questioned whether .NET performance improvements were similar. Has the well run dry? Are there no more “[performance] worlds to conquer”? I’m a bit giddy to say that, even with how fast .NET 6 is, .NET 7 definitively much more can be and has been done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | he highlights how                                                                  |
|  1 | As with previous versions of .NET, performance is a key focus that pervades the entire stack, be features created explicitly for performance or non-performance-related features that are designed and implemented with performance keenly in mind. And now that a .NET 7 release candidate is just around the corner, it’s a good time to discuss much of it. Over the course of year, every time I’ve reviewed a PR that might positively impact performance, I’ve copied that journal I maintain for the purposes of writing this post. When I sat down to write this a few was faced with a list of almost 1000 performance-impacting PRs (out of more than 7000 PRs went into the release), and I’m excited to share approximately 500 of them here with you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | whether it still the last link to a weeks ago, that                                |

In past years, I’ve received the odd piece of negative feedback the length of some of my performance-focused write-ups, and while I disagree with the respect the opinion. So, this year, consider this a “choose your own adventure.” If you’re here looking for a super short adventure, one that provides the top-level summary and a core take away from your time here, I’m happy to oblige:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | about criticism, I just message to                                                 |
|  3 | TL;DR: .NET 7 is fast. Really fast.

Both noted paths achieve one of my primary goals for spending the time to write these posts, highlight the greatness of the next release and to encourage everyone to give it a try. But, I goals for these posts, too. I want everyone interested to walk away from this post with an understanding of how .NET is implemented, why various decisions were made, tradeoffs that evaluated, techniques that were employed, algorithms that were considered, and valuable approaches that were utilized to make .NET even faster than it was previously. I want learn from our own learnings and find ways to apply this new-found knowledge to their own codebases, thereby further increasing the overall performance of code in the ecosystem.
