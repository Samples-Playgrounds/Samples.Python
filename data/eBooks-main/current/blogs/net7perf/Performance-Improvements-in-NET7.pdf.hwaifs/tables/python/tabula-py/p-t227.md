|  0 | Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?                                             |
|  1 | Thou art more lovely and more temperate:                                            |
|  2 | Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,                                       |
|  3 | And summer's lease hath all too short a date;                                       |
|  4 | Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,                                          |
|  5 | And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;                                            |
|  6 | And every fair from fair sometime declines,                                         |
|  7 | By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;                                    |
|  8 | But thy eternal summer shall not fade,                                              |
|  9 | Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;                                        |
| 10 | Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,                                   |
| 11 | When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:                                         |
| 12 | So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,                                         |
| 13 | So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.                                    |
