<p>Performance Improvements
in .NET 7</p>

<p>Partner Software Engineer, .NET</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>A year ago, I published Performance Improvements in .NET 6, following on the heels of similar posts
for .NET 5, .NET Core 3.0, .NET Core 2.1, and .NET Core 2.0. I enjoy writing these posts and love
reading developers’ responses to them. One comment in particular last year resonated with me. The
commenter cited the Die Hard movie quote, “‘When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he
wept for there were no more worlds to conquer’,” and questioned whether .NET performance
improvements were similar. Has the well run dry? Are there no more “[performance] worlds to
conquer”? I’m a bit giddy to say that, even with how fast .NET 6 is, .NET 7 definitively highlights how
much more can be and has been done.</p>
<p>As with previous versions of .NET, performance is a key focus that pervades the entire stack, whether it
be features created explicitly for performance or non-performance-related features that are still
designed and implemented with performance keenly in mind. And now that a .NET 7 release
candidate is just around the corner, it’s a good time to discuss much of it. Over the course of the last
year, every time I’ve reviewed a PR that might positively impact performance, I’ve copied that link to a
journal I maintain for the purposes of writing this post. When I sat down to write this a few weeks ago,
I was faced with a list of almost 1000 performance-impacting PRs (out of more than 7000 PRs that
went into the release), and I’m excited to share approximately 500 of them here with you.</p>
<p>One thought before we dive in. In past years, I’ve received the odd piece of negative feedback about
the length of some of my performance-focused write-ups, and while I disagree with the criticism, I
respect the opinion. So, this year, consider this a “choose your own adventure.” If you’re here just
looking for a super short adventure, one that provides the top-level summary and a core message to
take away from your time here, I’m happy to oblige:</p>
<p>TL;DR: .NET 7 is fast. Really fast. A thousand performance-impacting PRs went into runtime and core
libraries this release, never mind all the improvements in ASP.NET Core and Windows Forms and
Entity Framework and beyond. It’s the fastest .NET ever. If your manager asks you why your project
should upgrade to .NET 7, you can say “in addition to all the new functionality in the release, .NET 7 is
super fast.”</p>
<p>Or, if you prefer a slightly longer adventure, one filled with interesting nuggets of performance-
focused data, consider skimming through the post, looking for the small code snippets and
corresponding tables showing a wealth of measurable performance improvements. At that point, you,
too, may walk away with your head held high and my thanks.</p>
<p>Both noted paths achieve one of my primary goals for spending the time to write these posts, to
highlight the greatness of the next release and to encourage everyone to give it a try. But, I have other
goals for these posts, too. I want everyone interested to walk away from this post with an upleveled
understanding of how .NET is implemented, why various decisions were made, tradeoffs that were
evaluated, techniques that were employed, algorithms that were considered, and valuable tools and
approaches that were utilized to make .NET even faster than it was previously. I want developers to
learn from our own learnings and find ways to apply this new-found knowledge to their own
codebases, thereby further increasing the overall performance of code in the ecosystem. I want
developers to take an extra beat, think about reaching for a profiler the next time they’re working on a</p>
<p>gnarly problem, think about looking at the source for the component they’re using in order to better
understand how to work with it, and think about revisiting previous assumptions and decisions to
determine whether they’re still accurate and appropriate. And I want developers to be excited at the
prospect of submitting PRs to improve .NET not only for themselves but for every developer around
the globe using .NET. If any of that sounds interesting, then I encourage you to choose the last
adventure: prepare a carafe of your favorite hot beverage, get comfortable, and please enjoy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER  1</p>
<p>Setup</p>
<p>The microbenchmarks throughout this post utilize benchmarkdotnet. To make it easy for you to follow
along with your own validation, I have a very simple setup for the benchmarks I use. Create a new C#
project:</p>
<p>dotnet new console -o benchmarks
cd benchmarks</p>
<p>Your new benchmarks directory will contain a benchmarks.csproj file and a Program.cs file. Replace
the contents of benchmarks.csproj with this:</p>
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFrameworks>net7.0;net6.0</TargetFrameworks>
    <LangVersion>Preview</LangVersion>
    <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>
    <ServerGarbageCollection>true</ServerGarbageCollection>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="benchmarkdotnet" Version="0.13.2" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
<p>and the contents of Program.cs with this:</p>
<p>using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using Microsoft.Win32;
using System;
using System.Buffers;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Collections.Immutable;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;
using System.IO.Compression;
using System.IO.MemoryMappedFiles;
using System.IO.Pipes;
using System.Linq;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Net.Security;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Numerics;</p>

using System.Security.Authentication;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

public partial class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args) =&gt;
BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly).Run(args);</p>
<pre><code>// ... copy [Benchmark]s here
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>For each benchmark included in this write-up, you can then just copy and paste the code into this test
class, and run the benchmarks. For example, to run a benchmark comparing performance on .NET 6
and .NET 7, do:</p>
<p>dotnet run -c Release -f net6.0 --filter '**' --runtimes net6.0 net7.0</p>
<p>This command says “build the benchmarks in release configuration targeting the .NET 6 surface area,
and then run all of the benchmarks on both .NET 6 and .NET 7.” Or to run just on .NET 7:</p>
<p>dotnet run -c Release -f net7.0 --filter '**' --runtimes net7.0</p>
<p>which instead builds targeting the .NET 7 surface area and then only runs once against .NET 7. You
can do this on any of Windows, Linux, or macOS. Unless otherwise called out (e.g. where the
improvements are specific to Unix and I run the benchmarks on Linux), the results I share were
recorded on Windows 11 64-bit but aren’t Windows-specific and should show similar relative
differences on the other operating systems as well.</p>
<p>The release of the first .NET 7 release candidate is right around the corner. All of the measurements in
this post were gathered with a recent daily build of .NET 7 RC1.</p>
<p>Also, my standard caveat: These are microbenchmarks. It is expected that different hardware, different
versions of operating systems, and the way in which the wind is currently blowing can affect the
numbers involved. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 1 | Setup</p>
<p>CHAPTER  2</p>
<p>JIT</p>
<p>I’d like to kick off a discussion of performance improvements in the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler by
talking about something that itself isn’t actually a performance improvement. Being able to
understand exactly what assembly code is generated by the JIT is critical when fine-tuning lower-level,
performance-sensitive code. There are multiple ways to get at that assembly code. The online tool
sharplab.io is incredibly useful for this (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ashmind">@ashmind</a> for this
tool); however it currently only targets a single release, so as I write this I’m only able to see the
output for .NET 6, which makes it difficult to use for A/B comparisons. godbolt.org is also valuable for
this, with C# support added in compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer#3168 from
<a href="https://github.com/hez2010">@hez2010</a>, with similar limitations. The most flexible solutions involve
getting at that assembly code locally, as it enables comparing whatever versions or local builds you
desire with whatever configurations and switches set that you need.</p>
<p>One common approach is to use the [DisassemblyDiagnoser] in benchmarkdotnet. Simply slap the
[DisassemblyDiagnoser] attribute onto your test class: benchmarkdotnet will find the assembly code
generated for your tests and some depth of functions they call, and dump out the found assembly
code in a human-readable form. For example, if I run this test:</p>
<p>using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;
using System;</p>
<p>[DisassemblyDiagnoser]
public partial class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args) =&gt;
BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly).Run(args);</p>
<pre><code>private int _a = 42, _b = 84;

[Benchmark]
public int Min() =&gt; Math.Min(_a, _b);
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>with:</p>
<p>dotnet run -c Release -f net7.0 --filter '**'</p>
<p>in addition to doing all of its normal test execution and timing, benchmarkdotnet also outputs a
Program-asm.md file that contains this:</p>
<p>; Program.Min()
mov       eax,[rcx+8]
mov       edx,[rcx+0C]
cmp       eax,edx</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>jg        short M00_L01
mov       edx,eax
M00_L00:
mov       eax,edx
ret
M00_L01:
jmp       short M00_L00
; Total bytes of code 17</p>
<p>Pretty neat. This support was recently improved further in dotnet/benchmarkdotnet#2072, which
allows passing a filter list on the command-line to benchmarkdotnet to tell it exactly which methods’
assembly code should be dumped.</p>
<p>If you can get your hands on a “debug” or “checked” build of the .NET runtime (“checked” is a build
that has optimizations enabled but also still includes asserts), and specifically of clrjit.dll, another
valuable approach is to set an environment variable that causes the JIT itself to spit out a human-
readable description of all of the assembly code it emits. This can be used with any kind of
application, as it’s part of the JIT itself rather than part of any specific tool or other environment, it
supports showing the code the JIT generates each time it generates code (e.g. if it first compiles a
method without optimization and then later recompiles it with optimization), and overall it’s the most
accurate picture of the assembly code as it comes “straight from the horses mouth,” as it were. The
(big) downside of course is that it requires a non-release build of the runtime, which typically means
you need to build it yourself from the sources in the dotnet/runtime repo.</p>
<p>… until .NET 7, that is. As of dotnet/runtime#73365, this assembly dumping support is now available in
release builds as well, which means it’s simply part of .NET 7 and you don’t need anything special to
use it. To see this, try creating a simple “hello world” app like:</p>
<p>using System;</p>
<p>class Program
{
public static void Main() =&gt; Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</p>
<p>and building it (e.g. dotnet build -c Release). Then, set the DOTNET_JitDisasm environment
variable to the name of the method we care about, in this case “Main” (the exact syntax allowed is
more permissive and allows for some use of wildcards, optional namespace and class names, etc.). As
I’m using PowerShell, that means:</p>
<p>$env:DOTNET_JitDisasm=&quot;Main&quot;</p>
<p>and then running the app. You should see code like this output to the console:</p>
<p>; Assembly listing for method Program:Main()

<p>; Total bytes of code 36</p>
<p>Hello, world!</p>
<p>This is immeasurably helpful for performance analysis and tuning, even for questions as simple as “did
my function get inlined” or “is this code I expected to be optimized away actually getting optimized
away.” Throughout the rest of this post, I’ll include assembly snippets generated by one of these two
mechanisms, in order to help exemplify concepts.</p>
<p>Note that it can sometimes be a little confusing figuring out what name to specify as the value for
DOTNET_JitDisasm, especially when the method you care about is one that the C# compiler names or
name mangles (since the JIT only sees the IL and metadata, not the original C#), e.g. the name of the
entry point method for a program with top-level statements, the names of local functions, etc. To
both help with this and to provide a really valuable top-level view of the work the JIT is doing, .NET 7
also supports the new DOTNET_JitDisasmSummary environment variable (introduced in
dotnet/runtime#74090). Set that to “1”, and it’ll result in the JIT emitting a line every time it compiles a
method, including the name of that method which is copy/pasteable with DOTNET_JitDisasm. This
feature is useful in-and-of-itself, however, as it can quickly highlight for you what’s being compiled,
when, and with what settings. For example, if I set the environment variable and then run a “hello,
world” console app, I get this output:</p>
<p>1: JIT compiled CastHelpers:StelemRef(Array,long,Object) [Tier1, IL size=88, code
size=93]
2: JIT compiled CastHelpers:LdelemaRef(Array,long,long):byref [Tier1, IL size=44, code
size=44]
3: JIT compiled SpanHelpers:IndexOfNullCharacter(byref):int [Tier1, IL size=792, code
size=388]
4: JIT compiled Program:Main() [Tier0, IL size=11, code size=36]
5: JIT compiled ASCIIUtility:NarrowUtf16ToAscii(long,long,long):long [Tier0, IL
size=490, code size=1187]
Hello, world!</p>
<p>We can see for “hello, world” there’s only 5 methods that actually get JIT compiled. There are of
course many more methods that get executed as part of a simple “hello, world,” but almost all of
them have precompiled native code available as part of the “Ready To Run” (R2R) images of the core
libraries. The first three in the above list (StelemRef, LdelemaRef, and IndexOfNullCharacter) don’t
because they explicitly opted-out of R2R via use of the
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveOptimization)] attribute (despite the name, this
attribute should almost never be used, and is only used for very specific reasons in a few very specific
places in the core libraries). Then there’s our Main method. And lastly there’s the NarrowUtf16ToAscii</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>method, which doesn’t have R2R code, either, due to using the variable-width Vector<T> (more on
that later). Every other method that’s run doesn’t require JIT’ing. If we instead first set the
DOTNET_ReadyToRun environment variable to 0, the list is much longer, and gives you a very good
sense of what the JIT needs to do on startup (and why technologies like R2R are important for startup
time). Note how many methods get compiled before “hello, world” is output:</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s move on to actual performance improvements, starting with on-stack
replacement.</p>
<p>On-Stack Replacement</p>
<p>On-stack replacement (OSR) is one of the coolest features to hit the JIT in .NET 7. But to really
understand OSR, we first need to understand tiered compilation, so a quick recap…</p>
<p>One of the issues a managed environment with a JIT compiler has to deal with is tradeoffs between
startup and throughput. Historically, the job of an optimizing compiler is to, well, optimize, in order to
enable the best possible throughput of the application or service once running. But such optimization
takes analysis, takes time, and performing all of that work then leads to increased startup time, as all
of the code on the startup path (e.g. all of the code that needs to be run before a web server can
serve the first request) needs to be compiled. So a JIT compiler needs to make tradeoffs: better
throughput at the expense of longer startup time, or better startup time at the expense of decreased
throughput. For some kinds of apps and services, the tradeoff is an easy call, e.g. if your service starts
up once and then runs for days, several extra seconds of startup time doesn’t matter, or if you’re a
console application that’s going to do a quick computation and exit, startup time is all that matters.
But how can the JIT know which scenario it’s in, and do we really want every developer having to
know about these kinds of settings and tradeoffs and configure every one of their applications
accordingly? One answer to this has been ahead-of-time compilation, which has taken various forms
in .NET. For example, all of the core libraries are “crossgen”’d, meaning they’ve been run through a
tool that produces the previously mentioned R2R format, yielding binaries that contain assembly code
that needs only minor tweaks to actually execute; not every method can have code generated for it,
but enough that it significantly reduces startup time. Of course, such approaches have their own
downsides, e.g. one of the promises of a JIT compiler is it can take advantage of knowledge of the
current machine / process in order to best optimize, so for example the R2R images have to assume a</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>certain baseline instruction set (e.g. what vectorizing instructions are available) whereas the JIT can see
what’s actually available and use the best. “Tiered compilation” provides another answer, one that’s
usable with or without these other ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation solutions.</p>
<p>Tiered compilation enables the JIT to have its proverbial cake and eat it, too. The idea is simple: allow
the JIT to compile the same code multiple times. The first time, the JIT can use as a few optimizations
as make sense (a handful of optimizations can actually make the JIT’s own throughput faster, so those
still make sense to apply), producing fairly unoptimized assembly code but doing so really quickly.
And when it does so, it can add some instrumentation into the assembly to track how often the
methods are called. As it turns out, many functions used on a startup path are invoked once or maybe
only a handful of times, and it would take more time to optimize them than it does to just execute
them unoptimized. Then, when the method’s instrumentation triggers some threshold, for example a
method having been executed 30 times, a work item gets queued to recompile that method, but this
time with all the optimizations the JIT can throw at it. This is lovingly referred to as “tiering up.” Once
that recompilation has completed, call sites to the method are patched with the address of the newly
highly optimized assembly code, and future invocations will then take the fast path. So, we get faster
startup and faster sustained throughput. At least, that’s the hope.</p>
<p>A problem, however, is methods that don’t fit this mold. While it’s certainly the case that many
performance-sensitive methods are relatively quick and executed many, many, many times, there’s
also a large number of performance-sensitive methods that are executed just a handful of times, or
maybe even only once, but that take a very long time to execute, maybe even the duration of the
whole process: methods with loops. As a result, by default tiered compilation hasn’t applied to loops,
though it can be enabled by setting the DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops environment variable to 1. We
can see the effect of this by trying this simple console app with .NET 6. With the default settings, run
this app:</p>
<p>class Program
{
static void Main()
{
var sw = new System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch();
while (true)
{
sw.Restart();
for (int trial = 0; trial &lt; 10_000; trial++)
{
int count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; char.MaxValue; i++)
if (IsAsciiDigit((char)i))
count++;
}
sw.Stop();
Console.WriteLine(sw.Elapsed);
}</p>
<pre><code>    static bool IsAsciiDigit(char c) =&gt; (uint)(c - &#x27;0&#x27;) &lt;= 9;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>I get numbers printed out like:</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>00:00:00.5734352
00:00:00.5526667
00:00:00.5675267
00:00:00.5588724
00:00:00.5616028</p>
<p>Now, try setting DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops to 1. When I then run it again, I get numbers like this:</p>
<p>00:00:01.2841397
00:00:01.2693485
00:00:01.2755646
00:00:01.2656678
00:00:01.2679925</p>
<p>In other words, with DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops enabled, it’s taking 2.5x as long as without (the
default in .NET 6). That’s because this main function never gets optimizations applied to it. By setting
DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops to 1, we’re saying “JIT, please apply tiering to methods with loops as
well,” but this method with a loop is only ever invoked once, so for the duration of the process it ends
up remaining at “tier-0,” aka unoptimized. Now, let’s try the same thing with .NET 7. Regardless of
whether that environment variable is set, I again get numbers like this:</p>
<p>00:00:00.5528889
00:00:00.5562563
00:00:00.5622086
00:00:00.5668220
00:00:00.5589112</p>
<p>but importantly, this method was still participating in tiering. In fact, we can get confirmation of that
by using the aforementioned DOTNET_JitDisasmSummary=1 environment variable. When I set that and
run again, I see these lines in the output:</p>
<p>4: JIT compiled Program:Main() [Tier0, IL size=83, code size=319]
...
6: JIT compiled Program:Main() [Tier1-OSR @0x27, IL size=83, code size=380]</p>
<p>highlighting that Main was indeed compiled twice. How is that possible? On-stack replacement.</p>
<p>The idea behind on-stack replacement is a method can be replaced not just between invocations but
even while it’s executing, while it’s “on the stack.” In addition to the tier-0 code being instrumented
for call counts, loops are also instrumented for iteration counts. When the iterations surpass a certain
limit, the JIT compiles a new highly optimized version of that method, transfers all the local/register
state from the current invocation to the new invocation, and then jumps to the appropriate location in
the new method. We can see this in action by using the previously discussed DOTNET_JitDisasm
environment variable. Set that to Program:* in order to see the assembly code generated for all of the
methods in the Program class, and then run the app again. You should see output like the following:</p>

<p>A few relevant things to notice here. First, the comments at the top highlight how this code was
compiled:</p>
<p>; Tier-0 compilation
; MinOpts code</p>
<p>So, we know this is the initial version (“Tier-0”) of the method compiled with minimal optimization
(“MinOpts”). Second, note this line of the assembly:</p>
<p>FF152DD40B00         call     [Program:<Main>g__IsAsciiDigit|0_0(ushort):bool]</p>
<p>Our IsAsciiDigit helper method is trivially inlineable, but it’s not getting inlined; instead, the
assembly has a call to it, and indeed we can see below the generated code (also “MinOpts”) for
IsAsciiDigit. Why? Because inlining is an optimization (a really important one) that’s disabled as
part of tier-0 (because the analysis for doing inlining well is also quite costly). Third, we can see the
code the JIT is outputting to instrument this method. This is a bit more involved, but I’ll point out the
relevant parts. First, we see:</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>C745A8E8030000       mov      dword ptr [rbp-58H], 0x3E8</p>
<p>That 0x3E8 is the hex value for the decimal 1,000, which is the default number of iterations a loop
needs to iterate before the JIT will generate the optimized version of the method (this is configurable
via the DOTNET_TC_OnStackReplacement_InitialCounter environment variable). So we see 1,000
being stored into this stack location. Then a bit later in the method we see this:</p>
<p>G_M000_IG03:                ;; offset=004BH
8B4DA8               mov      ecx, dword ptr [rbp-58H]
FFC9                 dec      ecx
894DA8               mov      dword ptr [rbp-58H], ecx
837DA800             cmp      dword ptr [rbp-58H], 0
7F0E                 jg       SHORT G_M000_IG05</p>
<p>G_M000_IG04:                ;; offset=0059H

<p>G_M000_IG05:                ;; offset=0067H</p>
<p>The generated code is loading that counter into the ecx register, decrementing it, storing it back, and
then seeing whether the counter dropped to 0. If it didn’t, the code skips to G_M000_IG05, which is the
label for the actual code in the rest of the loop. But if the counter did drop to 0, the JIT proceeds to
store relevant state into the the rcx and edx registers and then calls the CORINFO_HELP_PATCHPOINT
helper method. That helper is responsible for triggering the creation of the optimized method if it
doesn’t yet exist, fixing up all appropriate tracking state, and jumping to the new method. And indeed,
if you look again at your console output from running the program, you’ll see yet another output for
the Main method:</p>

<p>Here, again, we notice a few interesting things. First, in the header we see this:</p>
<p>; Tier-1 compilation
; OSR variant for entry point 0x23
; optimized code</p>
<p>so we know this is both optimized “tier-1” code and is the “OSR variant” for this method. Second,
notice there’s no longer a call to the IsAsciiDigit helper. Instead, where that call would have been,
we see this:</p>
<p>G_M000_IG06:                ;; offset=0090H
0FB7CE               movzx    rcx, si
83C1D0               add      ecx, -48
83F909               cmp      ecx, 9
7702                 ja       SHORT G_M000_IG08</p>
<p>This is loading a value into rcx, subtracting 48 from it (48 is the decimal ASCII value of the '0'
character) and comparing the resulting value to 9. Sounds an awful lot like our IsAsciiDigit
implementation ((uint)(c - '0') &lt;= 9), doesn’t it? That’s because it is. The helper was successfully
inlined in this now-optimized code.</p>
<p>Great, so now in .NET 7, we can largely avoid the tradeoffs between startup and throughput, as OSR
enables tiered compilation to apply to all methods, even those that are long-running. A multitude of
PRs went into enabling this, including many over the last few years, but all of the functionality was
disabled in the shipping bits. Thanks to improvements like dotnet/runtime#62831 which implemented
support for OSR on Arm64 (previously only x64 support was implemented), and
dotnet/runtime#63406 and dotnet/runtime#65609 which revised how OSR imports and epilogs are
handled, dotnet/runtime#65675 enables OSR (and as a result DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops) by
default.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>But, tiered compilation and OSR aren’t just about startup (though they’re of course very valuable
there). They’re also about further improving throughput. Even though tiered compilation was
originally envisioned as a way to optimize startup while not hurting throughput, it’s become much
more than that. There are various things the JIT can learn about a method during tier-0 that it can
then use for tier-1. For example, the very fact that the tier-0 code executed means that any statics
accessed by the method will have been initialized, and that means that any readonly statics will not
only have been initialized by the time the tier-1 code executes but their values won’t ever change. And
that in turn means that any readonly statics of primitive types (e.g. bool, int, etc.) can be treated like
consts instead of static readonly fields, and during tier-1 compilation the JIT can optimize them
just as it would have optimized a const. For example, try running this simple program after setting
DOTNET_JitDisasm to Program:Test:</p>
<p>using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;</p>
<p>class Program
{
static readonly bool Is64Bit = Environment.Is64BitProcess;</p>
<pre><code>static int Main()
{
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1_000_000_000; i++)
        if (Test())
            count++;
    return count;
}

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
static bool Test() =&gt; Is64Bit;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>When I do so, I get this output:</p>

<p>Note, again, we see two outputs for Program:Test. First, we see the “Tier-0” code, which is accessing a
static (note the call     CORINFO_HELP_GETSHARED_NONGCSTATIC_BASE instruction). But then we see
the “Tier-1” code, where all of that overhead has vanished and is instead replaced simply by mov eax,</p>
<ol>
<li>Since the “Tier-0” code had to have executed in order for it to tier up, the “Tier-1” code was
generated knowing that the value of the static readonly bool Is64Bit field was true (1), and so
the entirety of this method is storing the value 1 into the eax register used for the return value.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is so useful that components are now written with tiering in mind. Consider the new Regex source
generator, which is discussed later in this post (Roslyn source generators were introduced a couple of
years ago; just as how Roslyn analyzers are able to plug into the compiler and surface additional
diagnostics based on all of the data the compiler learns from the source code, Roslyn source
generators are able to analyze that same data and then further augment the compilation unit with
additional source). The Regex source generator applies a technique based on this in
dotnet/runtime#67775. Regex supports setting a process-wide timeout that gets applied to Regex
instances that don’t explicitly set a timeout. That means, even though it’s super rare for such a
process-wide timeout to be set, the Regex source generator still needs to output timeout-related code
just in case it’s needed. It does so by outputting some helpers like this:</p>
<p>static class Utilities
{
internal static readonly TimeSpan s_defaultTimeout =
AppContext.GetData(&quot;REGEX_DEFAULT_MATCH_TIMEOUT&quot;) is TimeSpan timeout ? timeout :
Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan;
internal static readonly bool s_hasTimeout = s_defaultTimeout !=
Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan;
}</p>
<p>which it then uses at call sites like this:</p>
<p>if (Utilities.s_hasTimeout)
{
base.CheckTimeout();
}</p>
<p>In tier-0, these checks will still be emitted in the assembly code, but in tier-1 where throughput
matters, if the relevant AppContext switch hasn’t been set, then s_defaultTimeout will be</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan, at which point s_hasTimeout will be false. And since s_hasTimeout is a
static readonly bool, the JIT will be able to treat that as a const, and all conditions like if
(Utilities.s_hasTimeout) will be treated equal to if (false) and be eliminated from the
assembly code entirely as dead code.</p>
<p>But, this is somewhat old news. The JIT has been able to do such an optimization since tiered
compilation was introduced in .NET Core 3.0. Now in .NET 7, though, with OSR it’s also able to do so
by default for methods with loops (and thus enable cases like the regex one). However, the real magic
of OSR comes into play when combined with another exciting feature: dynamic PGO.</p>
<p>PGO</p>
<p>I wrote about profile-guided optimization (PGO) in my Performance Improvements in .NET 6 post, but
I’ll cover it again here as it’s seen a multitude of improvements for .NET 7.</p>
<p>PGO has been around for a long time, in any number of languages and compilers. The basic idea is
you compile your app, asking the compiler to inject instrumentation into the application to track
various pieces of interesting information. You then put your app through its paces, running through
various common scenarios, causing that instrumentation to “profile” what happens when the app is
executed, and the results of that are then saved out. The app is then recompiled, feeding those
instrumentation results back into the compiler, and allowing it to optimize the app for exactly how it’s
expected to be used. This approach to PGO is referred to as “static PGO,” as the information is all
gleaned ahead of actual deployment, and it’s something .NET has been doing in various forms for
years. From my perspective, though, the really interesting development in .NET is “dynamic PGO,”
which was introduced in .NET 6, but off by default.</p>
<p>Dynamic PGO takes advantage of tiered compilation. I noted that the JIT instruments the tier-0 code
to track how many times the method is called, or in the case of loops, how many times the loop
executes. It can instrument it for other things as well. For example, it can track exactly which concrete
types are used as the target of an interface dispatch, and then in tier-1 specialize the code to expect
the most common types (this is referred to as “guarded devirtualization,” or GDV). You can see this in
this little example. Set the DOTNET_TieredPGO environment variable to 1, and then run this on .NET 7:</p>
<p>class Program
{
static void Main()
{
IPrinter printer = new Printer();
for (int i = 0; ; i++)
{
DoWork(printer, i);
}
}</p>
<pre><code>static void DoWork(IPrinter printer, int i)
{
    printer.PrintIfTrue(i == int.MaxValue);
}

interface IPrinter
{
    void PrintIfTrue(bool condition);
</code></pre>
<p>23</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>}</p>
<pre><code>class Printer : IPrinter
{
    public void PrintIfTrue(bool condition)
    {
        if (condition) Console.WriteLine(&quot;Print!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>The tier-0 code for DoWork ends up looking like this:</p>
<p>G_M000_IG01:                ;; offset=0000H

<p>That first block is checking the concrete type of the IPrinter (stored in rdi) and comparing it against
the known type for Printer (0x7FFC3F1B2D98). If they’re different, it just jumps to the same interface
dispatch it was doing in the unoptimized version. But if they’re the same, it then jumps directly to an
inlined version of Printer.PrintIfTrue (you can see the call to Console:WriteLine right there in
this method). Thus, the common case (the only case in this example) is super efficient at the expense
of a single comparison and branch.</p>
<p>That all existed in .NET 6, so why are we talking about it now? Several things have improved. First,
PGO now works with OSR, thanks to improvements like dotnet/runtime#61453. That’s a big deal, as it
means hot long-running methods that do this kind of interface dispatch (which are fairly common)
can get these kinds of devirtualization/inlining optimizations. Second, while PGO isn’t currently
enabled by default, we’ve made it much easier to turn on. Between dotnet/runtime#71438 and
dotnet/sdk#26350, it’s now possible to simply put <TieredPGO>true</TieredPGO> into your .csproj,
and it’ll have the same effect as if you set DOTNET_TieredPGO=1 prior to every invocation of the app,
enabling dynamic PGO (note that it doesn’t disable use of R2R images, so if you want the entirety of
the core libraries also employing dynamic PGO, you’ll also need to set DOTNET_ReadyToRun=0). Third,
however, is dynamic PGO has been taught how to instrument and optimize additional things.</p>
<p>PGO already knew how to instrument virtual dispatch. Now in .NET 7, thanks in large part to
dotnet/runtime#68703, it can do so for delegates as well (at least for delegates to instance methods).
Consider this simple console app:</p>
<p>using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;</p>
<p>class Program
{
static int[] s_values = Enumerable.Range(0, 1_000).ToArray();</p>
<pre><code>static void Main()
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1_000_000; i++)
        Sum(s_values, i =&gt; i * 42);
}

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
static int Sum(int[] values, Func&lt;int, int&gt; func)
{
    int sum = 0;
    foreach (int value in values)
        sum += func(value);
    return sum;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is loading the target address from the delegate into r8 and is loading the address of the
expected target into rax. If they’re the same, it then simply performs the inlined operation (imul
r15d, edx, 42), and otherwise it jumps to G_M000_IG07 which calls to the function in r8. The effect
of this is obvious if we run this as a benchmark:</p>
<p>static int[] s_values = Enumerable.Range(0, 1_000).ToArray();</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public int DelegatePGO() =&gt; Sum(s_values, i =&gt; i * 42);</p>
<p>static int Sum(int[] values, Func&lt;int, int&gt;? func)
{
int sum = 0;
foreach (int value in values)
{
sum += func(value);
}
return sum;
}</p>
<p>With PGO disabled, we get the same performance throughput for .NET 6 and .NET 7:</p>

<p>But the picture changes when we enable dynamic PGO (DOTNET_TieredPGO=1). .NET 6 gets ~14%
faster, but .NET 7 gets ~3x faster!</p>

<p>dotnet/runtime#70377 is another valuable improvement with dynamic PGO, which enables PGO to
play nicely with loop cloning and invariant hoisting. To understand this better, a brief digression into
what those are. Loop cloning is a mechanism the JIT employs to avoid various overheads in the fast
path of a loop. Consider the Test method in this example:</p>
<p>using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;</p>
<p>class Program
{
static void Main()
{
int[] array = new int[10_000_000];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1_000_000; i++)
{
Test(array);
}
}</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private static bool Test(int[] array)
{
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 0x12345; i++)
{
if (array[i] == 42)
{
return true;
}
}</p>
<pre><code>    return false;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>The JIT doesn’t know whether the passed in array is of sufficient length that all accesses to array[i]
inside the loop will be in bounds, and thus it would need to inject bounds checks for every access.
While it’d be nice to simply do the length check up front and simply throw an exception early if it
wasn’t long enough, doing so could also change behavior (imagine the method were writing into the
array as it went, or otherwise mutating some shared state). Instead, the JIT employs “loop cloning.” It
essentially rewrites this Test method to be more like this:</p>
<p>if (array is not null &amp;&amp; array.Length &gt;= 0x12345)
{
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 0x12345; i++)
{
if (array[i] == 42) // no bounds checks emitted for this access :-)
{
return true;
}
}
}
else
{
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 0x12345; i++)
{
if (array[i] == 42) // bounds checks emitted for this access :-(
{
return true;
}
}
}
return false;</p>
<p>That way, at the expense of some code duplication, we get our fast loop without bounds checks and
only pay for the bounds checks in the slow path. You can see this in the generated assembly (if you
can’t already tell, DOTNET_JitDisasm is one of my favorite features in .NET 7):</p>

<p>That’s “loop cloning.” What about “invariant hoisting”? Hoisting means pulling something out of a
loop to be before the loop, and invariants are things that don’t change. Thus invariant hoisting is
pulling something out of a loop to before the loop in order to avoid recomputing every iteration of
the loop an answer that won’t change. Effectively, the previous example already showed invariant
hoisting, in that the bounds check is moved to be before the loop rather than in the loop, but a more
concrete example would be something like this:</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private static bool Test(int[] array)
{
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 0x12345; i++)
{
if (array[i] == array.Length - 42)
{
return true;
}
}</p>
<pre><code>return false;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>Note that the value of array.Length - 42 doesn’t change on each iteration of the loop, so it’s
“invariant” to the loop iteration and can be lifted out, which the generated code does:</p>

<p>Here again we see the array being tested for null (test rcx, rcx) and the array’s length being
checked (mov r8d, dword ptr [rcx+08H], cmp r8d, 0x12345), but then with the array’s length in
r8d, we then see this up-front block subtracting 42 from the length (add r8d, -42), and that’s before
we continue into the fast-path loop in the G_M000_IG03 block. This keeps that additional set of
operations out of the loop, thereby avoiding the overhead of recomputing the value per iteration.</p>
<p>Ok, so how does this apply to dynamic PGO? Remember that with the interface/virtual dispatch
avoidance PGO is able to do, it does so by doing a type check to see whether the type in use is the
most common type; if it is, it uses a fast path that calls directly to that type’s method (and in doing so
that call is then potentially inlined), and if it isn’t, it falls back to normal interface/virtual dispatch. That
check can be invariant to a loop. So when a method is tiered up and PGO kicks in, the type check can
now be hoisted out of the loop, making it even cheaper to handle the common case. Consider this
variation of our original example:</p>
<p>using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;</p>
<p>class Program
{
static void Main()
{
IPrinter printer = new BlankPrinter();
while (true)
{
DoWork(printer);
}

    {

    }
}

interface IPrinter
{
    void Print(int i);
}

class BlankPrinter : IPrinter

    public void Print(int i)

<p>33</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>jne SHORT G_M000_IG05), otherwise falling through to G_M000_IG03 which is a tight fast-path loop
that’s inlined BlankPrinter.Print with no type checks in sight!</p>
<p>Interestingly, improvements like this can bring with them their own challenges. PGO leads to a
significant increase in the number of type checks, since call sites that specialize for a given type need
to compare against that type. However, common subexpression elimination (CSE) hasn’t historically
worked for such type handles (CSE is a compiler optimization where duplicate expressions are
eliminated by computing the result once and then storing it for subsequent use rather than
recomputing it each time). dotnet/runtime#70580 fixes this by enabling CSE for such constant
handles. For example, consider this method:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]

<p>Bounds Check Elimination</p>
<p>One of the things that makes .NET attractive is its safety. The runtime guards access to arrays, strings,
and spans such that you can’t accidentally corrupt memory by walking off either end; if you do, rather
than reading/writing arbitrary memory, you’ll get exceptions. Of course, that’s not magic; it’s done by
the JIT inserting bounds checks every time one of these data structures is indexed. For example, this:</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
static int Read0thElement(int[] array) =&gt; array[0];</p>
<p>results in:</p>
<p>G_M000_IG01:                ;; offset=0000H
4883EC28             sub      rsp, 40</p>
<p>G_M000_IG02:                ;; offset=0004H
83790800             cmp      dword ptr [rcx+08H], 0
7608                 jbe      SHORT G_M000_IG04
8B4110               mov      eax, dword ptr [rcx+10H]</p>
<p>G_M000_IG03:                ;; offset=000DH
4883C428             add      rsp, 40
C3                   ret</p>
<p>G_M000_IG04:                ;; offset=0012H
E8E9A0C25F           call     CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL
CC                   int3</p>
<p>The array is passed into this method in the rcx register, pointing to the method table pointer in the
object, and the length of an array is stored in the object just after that method table pointer (which is
8 bytes in a 64-bit process). Thus the cmp dword ptr [rcx+08H], 0 instruction is reading the length</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>of the array and comparing the length to 0; that makes sense, since the length can’t be negative, and
we’re trying to access the 0th element, so as long as the length isn’t 0, the array has enough elements
for us to access its 0th element. In the event that the length was 0, the code jumps to the end of the
function, which contains call CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL; that’s a JIT helper function that throws an
IndexOutOfRangeException. If the length was sufficient, however, it then reads the int stored at the
beginning of the array’s data, which on 64-bit is 16 bytes (0x10) past the pointer (mov eax, dword
ptr [rcx+10H]).</p>
<p>While these bounds checks in and of themselves aren’t super expensive, do a lot of them and their
costs add up. So while the JIT needs to ensure that “safe” accesses don’t go out of bounds, it also tries
to prove that certain accesses won’t, in which case it needn’t emit the bounds check that it knows will
be superfluous. In every release of .NET, more and more cases have been added to find places these
bounds checks can be eliminated, and .NET 7 is no exception.</p>
<p>For example, dotnet/runtime#61662 from <a href="https://github.com/anthonycanino">@anthonycanino</a>
enabled the JIT to understand various forms of binary operations as part of range checks. Consider
this method:</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private static ushort[]? Convert(ReadOnlySpan<byte> bytes)
{
if (bytes.Length != 16)
{
return null;
}</p>
<pre><code>var result = new ushort[8];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; result.Length; i++)
{
    result[i] = (ushort)(bytes[i * 2] * 256 + bytes[i * 2 + 1]);
}

return result;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>It’s validating that the input span is 16 bytes long and then creating a new ushort[8] where each
ushort in the array combines two of the input bytes. To do that, it’s looping over the output array,
and indexing into the bytes array using i * 2 and i * 2 + 1 as the indices. On .NET 6, each of those
indexing operations would result in a bounds check, with assembly like:</p>
<p>cmp       r8d,10
jae       short G_M000_IG04
movsxd    r8,r8d</p>
<p>where that G_M000_IG04 is the call CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL we’re now familiar with. But on .NET
7, we get this assembly for the method:</p>

<p>No bounds checks, which is most easily seen by the lack of the telltale call
CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL at the end of the method. With this PR, the JIT is able to understand the
impact of certain multiplication and shift operations and their relationships to the bounds of the data
structure. Since it can see that the result array’s length is 8 and the loop is iterating from 0 to that
exclusive upper bound, it knows that i will always be in the range [0, 7], which means that i * 2 will
always be in the range [0, 14] and i * 2 + 1 will always be in the range [0, 15]. As such, it’s able
to prove that the bounds checks aren’t needed.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#61569 and dotnet/runtime#62864 also help to eliminate bounds checks when dealing
with constant strings and spans initialized from RVA statics (“Relative Virtual Address” static fields,
basically a static field that lives in a module’s data section). For example, consider this benchmark:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
[Arguments(1)]
public char GetChar(int i)
{
const string Text = &quot;hello&quot;;</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>return (uint)i &lt; Text.Length ? Text[i] : '\0';
}</p>
<p>On .NET 6, we get this assembly:</p>
<p>; Program.GetChar(Int32)
sub       rsp,28
mov       eax,edx
cmp       rax,5
jl        short M00_L00
xor       eax,eax
add       rsp,28
ret
M00_L00:
cmp       edx,5
jae       short M00_L01
mov       rax,2278B331450
mov       rax,[rax]
movsxd    rdx,edx
movzx     eax,word ptr [rax+rdx*2+0C]
add       rsp,28
ret
M00_L01:
call      CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL
int       3
; Total bytes of code 56</p>
<p>The beginning of this makes sense: the JIT was obviously able to see that the length of Text is 5, so
it’s implementing the (uint)i &lt; Text.Length check by doing cmp rax,5, and if i as an unsigned
value is greater than or equal to 5, it’s then zero’ing out the return value (to return the '\0') and
exiting. If the length is less than 5 (in which case it’s also at least 0 due to the unsigned comparison), it
then jumps to M00_L00 to read the value from the string… but we then see another cmp against 5, this
time as part of a range check. So even though the JIT knew the index was in bounds, it wasn’t able to
remove the bounds check. Now it is; in .NET 7, we get this:</p>
<p>; Program.GetChar(Int32)
cmp       edx,5
jb        short M00_L00
xor       eax,eax
ret
M00_L00:
mov       rax,2B0AF002530
mov       rax,[rax]
mov       edx,edx
movzx     eax,word ptr [rax+rdx*2+0C]
ret

<p>So much nicer.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#67141 is a great example of how evolving ecosystem needs drives specific
optimizations into the JIT. The Regex compiler and source generator handle some cases of regular
expression character classes by using a bitmap lookup stored in strings. For example, to determine
whether a char c is in the character class &quot;[A-Za-z0-9_]&quot; (which will match an underscore or any
ASCII letter or digit), the implementation ends up generating an expression like the body of the
following method:</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
[Arguments('a')]
public bool IsInSet(char c) =&gt;
c &lt; 128 &amp;&amp; (&quot;\0\0\0\u03FF\uFFFE\u87FF\uFFFE\u07FF&quot;[c &gt;&gt; 4] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (c &amp; 0xF))) != 0;</p>
<p>The implementation is treating an 8-character string as a 128-bit lookup table. If the character is
known to be in range (such that it’s effectively a 7-bit value), it’s then using the top 3 bits of the value
to index into the 8 elements of the string, and the bottom 4 bits to select one of the 16 bits in that
element, giving us an answer as to whether this input character is in the set or not. In .NET 6, even
though we know the character is in range of the string, the JIT couldn’t see through either the length
comparison or the bit shift.</p>

happen a lot in a Regex, making this a very useful addition.</p>
<p>Bounds checks are an obvious source of overhead when talking about array access, but they’re not the
only ones. There’s also the need to use the cheapest instructions possible. In .NET 6, with a method
like:</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private static int Get(int[] values, int i) =&gt; values[i];</p>
<p>assembly code like the following would be generated:</p>
<p>; Program.Get(Int32[], Int32)
sub       rsp,28
cmp       edx,[rcx+8]
jae       short M01_L00
movsxd    rax,edx
mov       eax,[rcx+rax*4+10]
add       rsp,28
ret
M01_L00:
call      CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL
int       3
; Total bytes of code 27</p>
<p>This should look fairly familiar from our previous discussion; the JIT is loading the array’s length
([rcx+8]) and comparing that with the value of i (in edx), and then jumping to the end to throw an
exception if i is out of bounds. Immediately after that jump we see a movsxd rax, edx instruction,
which is taking the 32-bit value of i from edx and moving it into the 64-bit register rax. And as part
of moving it, it’s sign-extending it; that’s the “sxd” part of the instruction name (sign-extending means
the upper 32 bits of the new 64-bit value will be set to the value of the upper bit of the 32-bit value,
so that the number retains its signed value). The interesting thing is, though, we know that the Length
of an array and of a span is non-negative, and since we just bounds checked i against the Length, we
also know that i is non-negative. That makes such sign-extension useless, since the upper bit is
guaranteed to be 0. Since the mov instruction that zero-extends is a tad cheaper than movsxd, we can
simply use that instead. And that’s exactly what dotnet/runtime#57970 from
<a href="https://github.com/pentp">@pentp</a> does for both arrays and spans (dotnet/runtime#70884 also
similarly avoids some signed casts in other situations). Now on .NET 7, we get this:</p>
<p>; Program.Get(Int32[], Int32)
sub       rsp,28
cmp       edx,[rcx+8]
jae       short M01_L00

mov       eax,[rcx+rax*4+10]
add       rsp,28

<p>That’s not the only source of overhead with array access, though. In fact, there’s a very large category
of array access overhead that’s been there forever, but that’s so well known there are even old FxCop
rules and newer Roslyn analyzers that warn against it: multidimensional array accesses. The overhead
in the case of a multidimensional array isn’t just an extra branch on every indexing operation, or
additional math required to compute the location of the element, but rather that they currently pass
through the JIT’s optimization phases largely unmodified. dotnet/runtime#70271 improves the state
of the world here by doing an expansion of a multidimensional array access early in the JIT’s pipeline,
such that later optimization phases can improve multidimensional accesses as they would other code,
including CSE and loop invariant hoisting. The impact of this is visible in a simple benchmark that
sums all the elements of a multidimensional array.</p>

<p>This previous example assumes you know the size of each dimension of the multidimensional array
(it’s referring to the Size directly in the loops). That’s obviously not always (or maybe even rarely) the
case. In such situations, you’d be more likely to use the Array.GetUpperBound method, and because</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>multidimensional arrays can have a non-zero lower bound, Array.GetLowerBound. That would lead to
code like this:</p>
<p>private int[,] _square;</p>
<p>[Params(1000)]
public int Size { get; set; }</p>
<p>[GlobalSetup]
public void Setup()

{
sum += square[i, j];
}
}
return sum;
}</p>
<p>In .NET 7, thanks to dotnet/runtime#60816, those GetLowerBound and GetUpperBound calls become
JIT intrinsics. An “intrinsic” to a compiler is something the compiler has intrinsic knowledge of, such
that rather than relying solely on a method’s defined implementation (if it even has one), the compiler
can substitute in something it considers to be better. There are literally thousands of methods in .NET
known in this manner to the JIT, with GetLowerBound and GetUpperBound being two of the most
recent. Now as intrinsics, when they’re passed a constant value (e.g. 0 for the 0th rank), the JIT can
substitute the necessary assembly instructions to read directly from the memory location that houses
the bounds. Here’s what the assembly code for this benchmark looked like with .NET 6; the main thing
to see here are all of the calls out to GetLowerBound and GetUpperBound:</p>

<p>Loop Hoisting and Cloning</p>
<p>We previously saw how PGO interacts with loop hoisting and cloning, and those optimizations have
seen other improvements, as well.</p>
<p>Historically, the JIT’s support for hoisting has been limited to lifting an invariant out one level.
Consider this example:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public void Compute()
{
for (int thousands = 0; thousands &lt; 10; thousands++)
{
for (int hundreds = 0; hundreds &lt; 10; hundreds++)
{
for (int tens = 0; tens &lt; 10; tens++)
{
for (int ones = 0; ones &lt; 10; ones++)
{
int n = ComputeNumber(thousands, hundreds, tens, ones);
Process(n);
}
}
}
}
}</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>static int ComputeNumber(int thousands, int hundreds, int tens, int ones) =&gt;
(thousands * 1000) +
(hundreds * 100) +
(tens * 10) +
ones;</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
static void Process(int n) { }</p>
<p>At first glance, you might look at this and say “what could be hoisted, the computation of n requires
all of the loop inputs, and all of that computation is in ComputeNumber.” But from a compiler’s
perspective, the ComputeNumber function is inlineable and thus logically can be part of its caller, the
computation of n is actually split into multiple pieces, and each of those pieces can be hoisted to
different levels, e.g. the tens computation can be hoisted out one level, the hundreds out two levels,
and the thousands out three levels. Here’s what [DisassemblyDiagnoser] outputs for .NET 6:</p>

<p>46</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>We can see that some hoisting has happened here. After all, the inner most loop (tagged M00_L03) is
only five instructions: increment ebp (which at this point is the ones counter value), and if it’s still less
than 0xA (10), jump back to M00_L03 which adds whatever is in r14 to ones. Great, so we’ve hoisted
all of the unnecessary computation out of the inner loop, being left only with adding the ones
position to the rest of the number. Let’s go out a level. M00_L02 is the label for the tens loop. What
do we see there? Trouble. The two instructions imul ecx,esi,3E8 and imul eax,edi,64 are
performing the thousands * 1000 and hundreds * 100 operations, highlighting that these
operations which could have been hoisted out further were left stuck in the next-to-innermost loop.
Now, here’s what we get for .NET 7, where this was improved in dotnet/runtime#68061:</p>

<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>Notice now where those imul instructions live. There are four labels, each one corresponding to one
of the loops, and we can see the outermost loop has the imul ebx,esi,3E8 (for the thousands
computation) and the next loop has the imul r14d,edi,64 (for the hundreds computation),
highlighting that these computations were hoisted out to the appropriate level (the tens and ones
computation are still in the right places).</p>
<p>More improvements have gone in on the cloning side. Previously, loop cloning would only apply for
loops iterating by 1 from a low to a high value. With dotnet/runtime#60148, the comparison against
the upper value can be &lt;= rather than just &lt;. And with dotnet/runtime#67930, loops that iterate
downward can also be cloned, as can loops that have increments and decrements larger than 1.
Consider this benchmark:</p>
<p>private int[] _values = Enumerable.Range(0, 1000).ToArray();</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
[Arguments(0, 0, 1000)]
public int LastIndexOf(int arg, int offset, int count)
{
int[] values = _values;
for (int i = offset + count - 1; i &gt;= offset; i--)
if (values[i] == arg)
return i;
return 0;
}</p>
<p>Without loop cloning, the JIT can’t assume that offset through offset+count are in range, and thus
every access to the array needs to be bounds checked. With loop cloning, the JIT could generate one
version of the loop without bounds checks and only use that when it knows all accesses will be valid.
That’s exactly what happens now in .NET 7. Here’s what we got with .NET 6:</p>

M00_L03, which jumps to a call CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL). And here’s what we get with .NET 7:</p>

<p>Notice how the code size is larger, and how there are now two variations of the loop: one at M00_L00
and one at M00_L01. The second one, M00_L01, has a branch to that same call
CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL, but the first one doesn’t, because that loop will only end up being used
after proving that the offset, count, and _values.Length are such that the indexing will always be in
bounds.</p>
<p>Other changes also improved loop cloning. dotnet/runtime#59886 enables the JIT to choose different
forms for how to emit the the conditions for choosing the fast or slow loop path, e.g. whether to emit</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>all the conditions, &amp; them together, and then branch (if (!(cond1 &amp; cond2)) goto slowPath), or
whether to emit each condition on its own (if (!cond1) goto slowPath; if (!cond2) goto
slowPath). dotnet/runtime#66257 enables loop cloning to kick in when the loop variable is initialized
to more kinds of expressions (e.g. for (int fromindex = lastIndex - lengthToClear; ...)). And
dotnet/runtime#70232 increases the JIT’s willingness to clone loops with bodies that do a broader set
of operations.</p>
<p>Folding, propagation, and substitution</p>
<p>Constant folding is an optimization where a compiler computes the value of an expression involving
only constants at compile-time rather than generating the code to compute the value at run-time.
There are multiple levels of constant folding in .NET, with some constant folding performed by the C#
compiler and some constant folding performed by the JIT compiler. For example, given the C# code:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public int A() =&gt; 3 + (4 * 5);</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public int B() =&gt; A() * 2;</p>
<p>the C# compiler will generate IL for these methods like the following:</p>
<p>.method public hidebysig instance int32 A () cil managed
{
.maxstack 8
IL_0000: ldc.i4.s 23
IL_0002: ret
}</p>
<p>.method public hidebysig instance int32 B () cil managed
{
.maxstack 8
IL_0000: ldarg.0
IL_0001: call instance int32 Program::A()
IL_0006: ldc.i4.2
IL_0007: mul
IL_0008: ret
}</p>
<p>You can see that the C# compiler has computed the value of 3 + (4*5), as the IL for method A simply
contains the equivalent of return 23;. However, method B contains the equivalent of return A() *
2;, highlighting that the constant folding performed by the C# compiler was intramethod only. Now
here’s what the JIT generates:</p>
<p>; Program.A()
mov       eax,17
ret
; Total bytes of code 6</p>
<p>; Program.B()
mov       eax,2E
ret
; Total bytes of code 6</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>The assembly for method A isn’t particularly interesting; it’s just returning that same value 23 (hex
0x17). But method B is more interesting. The JIT has inlined the call from B to A, exposing the contents
of A to B, such that the JIT effectively sees the body of B as the equivalent of return 23 * 2;. At that
point, the JIT can do its own constant folding, and it transforms the body of B to simply return 46 (hex
0x2e). Constant propagation is intricately linked to constant folding and is essentially just the idea that
you can substitute a constant value (typically one computed via constant folding) into further
expressions, at which point they may also be able to be folded.</p>
<p>The JIT has long performed constant folding, but it improves further in .NET 7. One of the ways
constant folding can improve is by exposing more values to be folded, which often means more
inlining. dotnet/runtime#55745 helped the inliner to understand that a method call like M(constant +
constant) (noting that those constants might be the result of some other method call) is itself
passing a constant to M, and a constant being passed to a method call is a hint to the inliner that it
should consider being more aggressive about inlining, since exposing that constant to the body of the
callee can potentially significantly reduce the amount of code required to implement the callee. The
JIT might have previously inlined such a method anyway, but when it comes to inlining, the JIT is all
about heuristics and generating enough evidence that it’s worthwhile to inline something; this
contributes to that evidence. This pattern shows up, for example, in the various FromXx methods on
TimeSpan. For example, TimeSpan.FromSeconds is implemented as:</p>
<p>public static TimeSpan FromSeconds(double value) =&gt; Interval(value, TicksPerSecond); //
TicksPerSecond is a constant</p>
<p>and, eschewing argument validation for the purposes of this example, Interval is:</p>
<p>private static TimeSpan Interval(double value, double scale) =&gt;
IntervalFromDoubleTicks(value * scale);
private static TimeSpan IntervalFromDoubleTicks(double ticks) =&gt; ticks == long.MaxValue ?
TimeSpan.MaxValue : new TimeSpan((long)ticks);</p>
<p>which if everything gets inlined means FromSeconds is essentially:</p>
<p>public static TimeSpan FromSeconds(double value)
{
double ticks = value * 10_000_000;
return ticks == long.MaxValue ? TimeSpan.MaxValue : new TimeSpan((long)ticks);
}</p>
<p>and if value is a constant, let’s say 5, that whole thing can be constant folded (with dead code
elimination on the ticks == long.MaxValue branch) to simply:</p>
<p>return new TimeSpan(50_000_000);</p>
<p>I’ll spare you the .NET 6 assembly for this, but on .NET 7 with a benchmark like:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public TimeSpan FromSeconds() =&gt; TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);</p>
<p>we now get the simple and clean:</p>
<p>; Program.FromSeconds()
mov       eax,2FAF080</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>ret
; Total bytes of code 6</p>
<p>Another change improving constant folding included dotnet/runtime#57726 from
<a href="https://github.com/SingleAccretion">@SingleAccretion</a>, which unblocked constant folding in a
particular scenario that sometimes manifests when doing field-by-field assignment of structs being
returned from method calls. As a small example, consider this trivial property, which access the
Color.DarkOrange property, which in turn does new Color(KnownColor.DarkOrange):</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public Color DarkOrange() =&gt; Color.DarkOrange;</p>
<p>In .NET 6, the JIT generated this:</p>
<p>; Program.DarkOrange()
mov       eax,1
mov       ecx,39
xor       r8d,r8d
mov       [rdx],r8
mov       [rdx+8],r8
mov       [rdx+10],cx
mov       [rdx+12],ax
mov       rax,rdx
ret
; Total bytes of code 32</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that some constants (39, which is the value of KnownColor.DarkOrange,
and 1, which is a private StateKnownColorValid constant) are being loaded into registers (mov eax,
1, mov ecx, 39) and then later being stored into the relevant location for the Color struct being
returned (mov [rdx+12],ax and mov [rdx+10],cx). In .NET 7, it now generates:</p>
<p>; Program.DarkOrange()
xor       eax,eax
mov       [rdx],rax
mov       [rdx+8],rax
mov       word ptr [rdx+10],39
mov       word ptr [rdx+12],1
mov       rax,rdx
ret
; Total bytes of code 25</p>
<p>with direct assignment of these constant values into their destination locations (mov word ptr
[rdx+12],1 and mov word ptr [rdx+10],39). Other changes contributing to constant folding
included dotnet/runtime#58171 from <a href="https://github.com/SingleAccretion">@SingleAccretion</a> and
dotnet/runtime#57605 from <a href="https://github.com/SingleAccretion">@SingleAccretion</a>.</p>
<p>However, a large category of improvement came from an optimization related to propagation, that of
forward substitution. Consider this silly benchmark:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public int Compute1() =&gt; Value + Value + Value + Value + Value;</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public int Compute2() =&gt; SomethingElse() + Value + Value + Value + Value + Value;</p>
<p>private static int Value =&gt; 16;</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private static int SomethingElse() =&gt; 42;</p>
<p>If we look at the assembly code generated for Compute1 on .NET 6, it looks like what we’d hope for.
We’re adding Value 5 times, Value is trivially inlined and returns a constant value 16, and so we’d
hope that the assembly code generated for Compute1 would effectively just be returning the value 80
(hex 0x50), which is exactly what happens:</p>
<p>; Program.Compute1()
mov       eax,50
ret
; Total bytes of code 6</p>
<p>But Compute2 is a bit different. The structure of the code is such that the additional call to
SomethingElse ends up slightly perturbing something about the JIT’s analysis, and .NET 6 ends up
with this assembly code:</p>
<p>; Program.Compute2()
sub       rsp,28
call      Program.SomethingElse()
add       eax,10
add       eax,10
add       eax,10
add       eax,10
add       eax,10
add       rsp,28
ret
; Total bytes of code 29</p>
<p>Rather than a single mov eax, 50 to put the value 0x50 into the return register, we have 5 separate
add eax, 10 to build up that same 0x50 (80) value. That’s… not ideal.</p>
<p>It turns out that many of the JIT’s optimizations operate on the tree data structures created as part of
parsing the IL. In some cases, optimizations can do better when they’re exposed to more of the
program, in other words when the tree they’re operating on is larger and contains more to be
analyzed. However, various operations can break up these trees into smaller, individual ones, such as
with temporary variables created as part of inlining, and in doing so can inhibit these operations.
Something is needed in order to effectively stitch these trees back together, and that’s forward
substitution. You can think of forward substitution almost like an inverse of CSE; rather than trying to
find duplicate expressions and eliminate them by computing the value once and storing it into a
temporary, forward substitution eliminates that temporary and effectively moves the expression tree
into its use site. Obviously you don’t want to do this if it would then negate CSE and result in
duplicate work, but for expressions that are defined once and used once, this kind of forward
propagation is valuable. dotnet/runtime#61023 added an initial limited version of forward
substitution, and then dotnet/runtime#63720 added a more robust generalized implementation.
Subsequently, dotnet/runtime#70587 expanded it to also cover some SIMD vectors, and then
dotnet/runtime#71161 improved it further to enable substitutions into more places (in this case into
call arguments). And with those, our silly benchmark now produces the following on .NET 7:</p>
<p>; Program.Compute2()
sub       rsp,28
call      qword ptr [7FFCB8DAF9A8]</p>

<p>Vectorization</p>
<p>SIMD, or Single Instruction Multiple Data, is a kind of processing in which one instruction applies to
multiple pieces of data at the same time. You’ve got a list of numbers and you want to find the index
of a particular value? You could walk the list comparing one element at a time, and that would be fine
functionally. But what if in the same amount of time it takes you to read and compare one element,
you could instead read and compare two elements, or four elements, or 32 elements? That’s SIMD,
and the art of utilizing SIMD instructions is lovingly referred to as “vectorization,” where operations
are applied to all of the elements in a “vector” at the same time.</p>
<p>.NET has long had support for vectorization in the form of Vector<T>, which is an easy-to-use type
with first-class JIT support to enable a developer to write vectorized implementations. One of
Vector<T>’s greatest strengths is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The type is designed to adapt to
whatever width vector instructions are available in your hardware. If the machine supports 256-bit
width vectors, great, that’s what Vector<T> will target. If not, if the machine supports 128-bit width
vectors, great, that’s what Vector<T> targets. But that flexibility comes with various downsides, at least
today; for example, the operations you can perform on a Vector<T> end up needing to be agnostic to
the width of the vectors used, since the width is variable based on the hardware on which the code
actually runs. And that means the operations that can be exposed on Vector<T> are limited, which in
turn limits the kinds of operations that can be vectorized with it. Also, because it’s only ever a single
size in a given process, some data set sizes that fall in between 128 bits and 256 bits might not be
processed as well as you’d hope. You write your Vector<byte>-based algorithm, and you run it on a
machine with support for 256-bit vectors, which means it can process 32 bytes at a time, but then you
feed it an input with 31 bytes. Had Vector<T> mapped to 128-bit vectors, it could have been used to
improve the processing of that input, but as its vector size is larger than the input data size, the
implementation ends up falling back to one that’s not accelerated. There are also issues related to
R2R and Native AOT, since ahead-of-time compilation needs to know in advance what instructions
should be used for Vector<T> operations. You already saw this earlier when discussing the output of
DOTNET_JitDisasmSummary; we saw that the NarrowUtf16ToAscii method was one of only a few
methods that was JIT compiled in a “hello, world” console app, and that this was because it lacked R2R
code due to its use of Vector<T>.</p>
<p>Starting in .NET Core 3.0, .NET gained literally thousands of new “hardware intrinsics” methods, most
of which are .NET APIs that map down to one of these SIMD instructions. These intrinsics enable an
expert to write an implementation tuned to a specific instruction set, and if done well, get the best
possible performance, but it also requires the developer to understand each instruction set and to
implement their algorithm for each instruction set that might be relevant, e.g. an AVX2
implementation if it’s supported, or an SSE2 implementation if it’s supported, or an ArmBase
implementation if it’s supported, and so on.</p>
<p>.NET 7 has introduced a middle ground. Previous releases saw the introduction of the Vector128<T>
and Vector256<T> types, but purely as the vehicle by which data moved in and out of the hardware
intrinsics, since they’re all tied to specific width vectors. Now in .NET 7, exposed via</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#53450, dotnet/runtime#63414, dotnet/runtime#60094, and dotnet/runtime#68559, a
very large set of cross-platform operations is defined over these types as well, e.g.
Vector128<T>.ExtractMostSignificantBits, Vector256.ConditionalSelect, and so on. A
developer who wants or needs to go beyond what the high-level Vector<T> offers can choose to
target one or more of these two types. Typically this would amount to a developer writing one code
path based on Vector128<T>, as that has the broadest reach and achieves a significant amount of the
gains from vectorization, and then if is motivated to do so can add a second path for Vector256<T> in
order to potentially double throughput further on platforms that have 256-bit width vectors. Think of
these types and methods as a platform-abstraction layer: you code to these methods, and then the JIT
translates them into the most appropriate instructions for the underlying platform. Consider this
simple code as an example:</p>
<p>using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86;</p>
<p>internal class Program
{
private static void Main()
{
Vector128<byte> v = Vector128.Create((byte)123);
while (true)
{
WithIntrinsics(v);
WithVector(v);
}
}</p>
<pre><code>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private static int WithIntrinsics(Vector128&lt;byte&gt; v) =&gt; Sse2.MoveMask(v);

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private static uint WithVector(Vector128&lt;byte&gt; v) =&gt; v.ExtractMostSignificantBits();
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>I have two functions: one that directly uses the Sse2.MoveMask hardware intrinsic and one that uses
the new Vector128<T>.ExtractMostSignificantBits method. Using DOTNET_JitDisasm=Program.*,
here’s what the optimized tier-1 code for these looks like on my x64 Windows machine:</p>
<p>; Assembly listing for method Program:WithIntrinsics(Vector128`1):int
G_M000_IG01:                ;; offset=0000H

<p>G_M000_IG03:                ;; offset=000BH
C3                   ret</p>
<p>; Total bytes of code 12</p>
<p>Notice anything? The code for the two methods is identical, both resulting in a vpmovmskb (Move Byte
Mask) instruction. Yet the former code will only work on a platform that supports SSE2 whereas the
latter code will work on any platform with support for 128-bit vectors, including Arm64 and WASM
(and any future platforms on-boarded that also support SIMD); it’ll just result in different instructions
being emitted on those platforms.</p>
<p>To explore this a bit more, let’s take a simple example and vectorize it. We’ll implement a Contains
method, where we want to search a span of bytes for a specific value and return whether it was found:</p>
<p>static bool Contains(ReadOnlySpan<byte> haystack, byte needle)
{
for (int i = 0; i &lt; haystack.Length; i++)
{
if (haystack[i] == needle)
{
return true;
}
}</p>
<pre><code>return false;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>How would we vectorize this with Vector<T>? First things first, we need to check whether it’s even
supported, and fall back to our existing implementation if it’s not (Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated).
We also need to fall back if the length of the input is less than the size of a vector
(Vector<byte>.Count).</p>
<p>static bool Contains(ReadOnlySpan<byte> haystack, byte needle)
{
if (Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated &amp;&amp; haystack.Length &gt;= Vector<byte>.Count)
{
// ...
}
else
{
for (int i = 0; i &lt; haystack.Length; i++)
{
if (haystack[i] == needle)
{
return true;
}
}
}</p>
<pre><code>return false;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>Now that we know we have enough data, we can get to coding our vectorized loop. In this loop, we’ll
be searching for the needle, which means we need a vector that contains that value for every element;
the Vector<T>’s constructor provides that (new Vector<byte>(needle)). And we need to be able to
slice off a vector’s width of data at a time; for a bit more efficiency, I’ll use pointers. We need a current
iteration pointer, and we need to iterate until the point where we couldn’t form another vector
because we’re too close to the end, and a straightforward way to do that is to get a pointer that’s
exactly one vector’s width from the end; that way, we can just iterate until our current pointer is equal
to or greater than that threshold. And finally, in our loop body, we need to compare our current
vector with the target vector to see if any elements are the same (Vector.EqualsAny), if any is
returning true, and if not bumping our current pointer to the next location. At this point we have:</p>
<p>static unsafe bool Contains(ReadOnlySpan<byte> haystack, byte needle)
{
if (Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated &amp;&amp; haystack.Length &gt;= Vector<byte>.Count)
{
fixed (byte* haystackPtr = &amp;MemoryMarshal.GetReference(haystack))
{
Vector<byte> target = new Vector<byte>(needle);
byte* current = haystackPtr;
byte* endMinusOneVector = haystackPtr + haystack.Length - Vector<byte>.Count;
do
{
if (Vector.EqualsAny(target, <em>(Vector<byte></em>)current))
{
return true;
}</p>
<pre><code>            current += Vector&lt;byte&gt;.Count;
        }
        while (current &lt; endMinusOneVector);

        // ...
    }
}
else
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; haystack.Length; i++)
    {
        if (haystack[i] == needle)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
}

return false;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>And we’re almost done. The last issue to handle is we may still have a few elements at the end we
haven’t searched. There are a couple of ways we could handle that. One would be to just continue
with our fall back implementation and process each of the remaining elements one at a time. Another
would be to employ a trick that’s common when vectorizing idempotent operations. Our operation
isn’t mutating anything, which means it doesn’t matter if we compare the same element multiple
times, which means we can just do one final vector compare for the last vector in the search space;</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>that might or might not overlap with elements we’ve already looked at, but it won’t hurt anything if it
does. And with that, our implementation is complete:</p>
<p>static unsafe bool Contains(ReadOnlySpan<byte> haystack, byte needle)
{
if (Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated &amp;&amp; haystack.Length &gt;= Vector<byte>.Count)
{
fixed (byte* haystackPtr = &amp;MemoryMarshal.GetReference(haystack))
{
Vector<byte> target = new Vector<byte>(needle);
byte* current = haystackPtr;
byte* endMinusOneVector = haystackPtr + haystack.Length - Vector<byte>.Count;
do
{
if (Vector.EqualsAny(target, <em>(Vector<byte></em>)current))
{
return true;

        }

        {
            return true;
        }
    }

<p>Congratulations, we’ve vectorized this operation, and fairly decently at that. We can throw this into
benchmarkdotnet and see really nice speedups:</p>

own method</p>

<p>A 24x speedup! Woo hoo, victory, all your performance are belong to us!</p>
<p>You deploy this in your service, and you see Contains being called on your hot path, but you don’t
see the improvements you were expecting. You dig in a little more, and you discover that while you
tested this with an input array with 1000 elements, typical inputs had more like 30 elements. What
happens if we change our benchmark to have just 30 elements? That’s not long enough to form a
vector, so we fall back to the one-at-a-time path, and we don’t get any speedups at all.</p>
<p>One thing we can now do is switch from using Vector<T> to Vector128<T>. That will then lower the
threshold from 32 bytes to 16 bytes, such that inputs in that range will still have some amount of
vectorization applied. As these Vector128<T> and Vector256<T> types have been designed very
recently, they also utilize all the cool new toys, and thus we can use refs instead of pointers. Other
than that, we can keep the shape of our implementation almost the same, substituting Vector128
where we were using Vector, and using some methods on Unsafe to manipulate our refs instead of
pointer arithmetic on the span we fixed.</p>

our cake and eat it, too? Let’s also add a Vector256<T> path. To do that, we literally copy/paste our
Vector128<T> code, search/replace all references to Vector128 in the copied code with Vector256,
and just put it into an additional condition that uses the Vector256<T> path if it’s supported and there
are enough elements to utilize it.</p>

<p>We now have an implementation that is vectorized on any platform with either 128-bit or 256-bit
vector instructions (x86, x64, Arm64, WASM, etc.), that can use either based on the input length, and
that can be included in an R2R image if that’s of interest.</p>
<p>There are many factors that impact which path you go down, and I expect we’ll have guidance
forthcoming to help navigate all the factors and approaches. But the capabilities are all there, and
whether you choose to use Vector<T>, Vector128<T> and/or Vector256<T>, or the hardware
intrinsics directly, there are some amazing performance opportunities ready for the taking.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>I already mentioned several PRs that exposed the new cross-platform vector support, but that only
scratches the surface of the work done to actually enable these operations and to enable them to
produce high-quality code. As just one example of a category of such work, a set of changes went in
to help ensure that zero vector constants are handled well, such as dotnet/runtime#63821 that
“morphed” (changed) Vector128/256<T>.Create(default) into Vector128/256<T>.Zero, which then
enables subsequent optimizations to focus only on Zero; dotnet/runtime#65028 that enabled
constant propagation of Vector128/256<T>.Zero; dotnet/runtime#68874 and dotnet/runtime#70171
that add first-class knowledge of vector constants to the JIT’s intermediate representation; and
dotnet/runtime#62933, dotnet/runtime#65632, dotnet/runtime#55875, dotnet/runtime#67502, and
dotnet/runtime#64783 that all improve the code quality of instructions generated for zero vector
comparisons.</p>
<p>Inlining</p>
<p>Inlining is one of the most important optimizations the JIT can do. The concept is simple: instead of
making a call to some method, take the code from that method and bake it into the call site. This has
the obvious advantage of avoiding the overhead of a method call, but except for really small methods
on really hot paths, that’s often on the smaller side of the wins inlining brings. The bigger wins are
due to the callee’s code being exposed to the caller’s code, and vice versa. So, for example, if the
caller is passing a constant as an argument to the callee, if the method isn’t inlined, the compilation of
the callee has no knowledge of that constant, but if the callee is inlined, all of the code in the callee is
then aware of its argument being a constant value, and can do all of the optimizations possible with
such a constant, like dead code elimination, branch elimination, constant folding and propagation,
and so on. Of course, if it were all rainbows and unicorns, everything possible to be inlined would be
inlined, and that’s obviously not happening. Inlining brings with it the cost of potentially increased
binary size. If the code being inlined would result in the same amount or less assembly code in the
caller than it takes to call the callee (and if the JIT can quickly determine that), then inlining is a no-
brainer. But if the code being inlined would increase the size of the callee non-trivially, now the JIT
needs to weigh that increase in code size against the throughput benefits that could come from it.
That code size increase can itself result in throughput regressions, due to increasing the number of
distinct instructions to be executed and thereby putting more pressure on the instruction cache. As
with any cache, the more times you need to read from memory to populate it, the less effective the
cache will be. If you have a function that gets inlined into 100 different call sites, every one of those
call sites’ copies of the callee’s instructions are unique, and calling each of those 100 functions could
end up thrashing the instruction cache; in contrast, if all of those 100 functions “shared” the same
instructions by simply calling the single instance of the callee, it’s likely the instruction cache would be
much more effective and lead to fewer trips to memory.</p>
<p>All that is to say, inlining is really important, it’s important that the “right” things be inlined and that it
not overinline, and as such every release of .NET in recent memory has seen nice improvements
around inlining. .NET 7 is no exception.</p>
<p>One really interesting improvement around inlining is dotnet/runtime#64521, and it might be
surprising. Consider the Boolean.ToString method; here’s its full implementation:</p>
<p>public override string ToString()
{</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>if (!m_value) return &quot;False&quot;;
return &quot;True&quot;;
}</p>
<p>Pretty simple, right? You’d expect something this trivial to be inlined. Alas, on .NET 6, this benchmark:</p>
<p>private bool _value = true;</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public int BoolStringLength() =&gt; _value.ToString().Length;</p>
<p>produces this assembly code:</p>
<p>; Program.BoolStringLength()
sub       rsp,28
cmp       [rcx],ecx
add       rcx,8
call      System.Boolean.ToString()
mov       eax,[rax+8]
add       rsp,28
ret
; Total bytes of code 23</p>
<p>Note the call System.Boolean.ToString(). The reason for this is, historically, the JIT has been
unable to inline methods across assembly boundaries if those methods contain string literals (like the
&quot;False&quot; and &quot;True&quot; in that Boolean.ToString implementation). This restriction had to do with string
interning and the possibility that such inlining could lead to visible behavioral differences. Those
concerns are no longer valid, and so this PR removes the restriction. As a result, that same benchmark
on .NET 7 now produces this:</p>
<p>; Program.BoolStringLength()
cmp       byte ptr [rcx+8],0
je        short M00_L01
mov       rax,1DB54800D20
mov       rax,[rax]
M00_L00:
mov       eax,[rax+8]
ret
M00_L01:
mov       rax,1DB54800D18
mov       rax,[rax]
jmp       short M00_L00
; Total bytes of code 38</p>
<p>No more call System.Boolean.ToString().</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#61408 made two changes related to inlining. First, it taught the inliner how to better
see the what methods were being called in an inlining candidate, and in particular when tiered
compilation is disabled or when a method would bypass tier-0 (such as a method with loops before
OSR existed or with OSR disabled); by understanding what methods are being called, it can better
understand the cost of the method, e.g. if those method calls are actually hardware intrinsics with a
very low cost. Second, it enabled CSE in more cases with SIMD vectors.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#71778 also impacted inlining, and in particular in situations where a typeof() could
be propagated to the callee (e.g. via a method argument). In previous releases of .NET, various</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>members on Type like IsValueType were turned into JIT intrinsics, such that the JIT could substitute a
constant value for calls where it could compute the answer at compile time. For example, this:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public bool IsValueType() =&gt; IsValueType<int>();</p>
<p>private static bool IsValueType<T>() =&gt; typeof(T).IsValueType;</p>
<p>results in this assembly code on .NET 6:</p>
<p>; Program.IsValueType()
mov       eax,1
ret
; Total bytes of code 6</p>
<p>However, change the benchmark slightly:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public bool IsValueType() =&gt; IsValueType(typeof(int));</p>
<p>private static bool IsValueType(Type t) =&gt; t.IsValueType;</p>
<p>and it’s no longer as simple:</p>
<p>; Program.IsValueType()
sub       rsp,28
mov       rcx,offset MT_System.Int32
call      CORINFO_HELP_TYPEHANDLE_TO_RUNTIMETYPE
mov       rcx,rax
mov       rax,[7FFCA47C9560]
cmp       [rcx],ecx
add       rsp,28
jmp       rax
; Total bytes of code 38</p>
<p>Effectively, as part of inlining the JIT loses the notion that the argument is a constant and fails to
propagate it. This PR fixes that, such that on .NET 7, we now get what we expect:</p>
<p>; Program.IsValueType()
mov       eax,1
ret
; Total bytes of code 6</p>
<p>Arm64</p>
<p>A huge amount of effort in .NET 7 went into making code gen for Arm64 as good or better than its
x64 counterpart. I’ve already discussed a bunch of PRs that are relevant regardless of architecture, and
others that are specific to Arm, but there are plenty more. To rattle off some of them:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Addressing modes. “Addressing mode” is the term used to refer to how the operand of
instructions are specified. It could be the actual value, it could be the address from where a value
should be loaded, it could be the register containing the value, and so on. Arm supports a
“scaled” addressing mode, typically used for indexing into an array, where the size of each
element is supplied and the instruction “scales” the provided offset by the specified scale.
dotnet/runtime#60808 enables the JIT to utilize this addressing mode. More generally,
dotnet/runtime#70749 enables the JIT to use addressing modes when accessing elements of</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>managed arrays. dotnet/runtime#66902 improves the use of addressing modes when the
element type is byte. dotnet/runtime#65468 improves addressing modes used for floating point.
And dotnet/runtime#67490 implements addressing modes for SIMD vectors, specifically for
loads with unscaled indices.</p>
<p>Better instruction selection. Various techniques go into ensuring that the best instructions are
selected to represent input code. dotnet/runtime#61037 teaches the JIT how to recognize the
pattern (a * b) + c with integers and fold that into a single madd or msub instruction, while
dotnet/runtime#66621 does the same for a - (b * c) and msub. dotnet/runtime#61045
enables the JIT to recognize certain constant bit shift operations (either explicit in the code or
implicit to various forms of managed array access) and emit sbfiz/ubfiz instructions.
dotnet/runtime#70599, dotnet/runtime#66407, and dotnet/runtime#65535 all handle various
forms of optimizing a % b. dotnet/runtime#61847 from
<a href="https://github.com/SeanWoo">@SeanWoo</a> removes an unnecessary movi emitted as part of
setting a dereferenced pointer to a constant value. dotnet/runtime#57926 from
<a href="https://github.com/SingleAccretion">@SingleAccretion</a> enables computing a 64-bit result as the
multiplication of two 32-bit integers to be done with smull/umull. And dotnet/runtime#61549
folds adds with sign extension or zero extension into a single add instruction with
uxtw/sxtw/lsl, while dotnet/runtime#62630 drops redundant zero extensions after a ldr
instruction.</p>
<p>Vectorization. dotnet/runtime#64864 adds new
AdvSimd.LoadPairVector64/AdvSimd.LoadPairVector128 hardware intrinsics.</p>
<p>Zeroing. Lots of operations require state to be set to zero, such as initializing all reference locals
in a method to zero as part of the method’s prologue (so that the GC doesn’t see and try to
follow garbage references). While such functionality was previously vectorized,
dotnet/runtime#63422 enables this to be implemented using 128-bit width vector instructions
on Arm. And dotnet/runtime#64481 changes the instruction sequences used for zeroing in order
to avoid unnecessary zeroing, free up additional registers, and enable the CPU to recognize
various instruction sequences and better optimize.</p>
<p>•  Memory Model. dotnet/runtime#62895 enables store barriers to be used wherever possible</p>
<p>instead of full barriers, and uses one-way barriers for volatile variables. dotnet/runtime#67384
enables volatile reads/writes to be implemented with the ldapr instruction, while
dotnet/runtime#64354 uses a cheaper instruction sequence to handle volatile indirections.
There’s dotnet/runtime#70600, which enables LSE Atomics to be used for Interlocked
operations; dotnet/runtime#71512, which enables using the atomics instruction on Unix
machines; and dotnet/runtime#70921, which enables the same but on Windows.</p>
<p>JIT helpers</p>
<p>While logically part of the runtime, the JIT is actually isolated from the rest of the runtime, only
interacting with it through an interface that enables communication between the JIT and the rest of
the VM (Virtual Machine). There’s a large amount of VM functionality then that the JIT relies on for
good performance.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#65738 rewrote various “stubs” to be more efficient. Stubs are tiny bits of code that
serve to perform some check and then redirect execution somewhere else. For example, when an
interface dispatch call site is expected to only ever be used with a single implementation of that
interface, the JIT might employ a “dispatch stub” that compares the type of the object against the</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 | JIT</p>
<p>single one it’s cached, and if they’re equal simply jumps to the right target. You know you’re in the
corest of the core areas of the runtime when a PR contains lots of assembly code for every
architecture the runtime targets. And it paid off; there’s a virtual group of folks from around .NET that
review performance improvements and regressions in our automated performance test suites, and
attribute these back to the PRs likely to be the cause (this is mostly automated but requires some
human oversight). It’s always nice then when a few days after a PR is merged and performance
information has stabilized that you see a rash of comments like there were on this PR:</p>
<p>For anyone familiar with generics and interested in performance, you may have heard the refrain that
generic virtual methods are relatively expensive. They are, comparatively. For example on .NET 6, this
code:</p>
<p>private Example _example = new Example();</p>
<p>[Benchmark(Baseline = true)] public void GenericNonVirtual() =&gt;
_example.GenericNonVirtual<Example>();
[Benchmark] public void GenericVirtual() =&gt; _example.GenericVirtual<Example>();</p>
<p>class Example
{
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
public void GenericNonVirtual<T>() { }</p>
<pre><code>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
public virtual void GenericVirtual&lt;T&gt;() { }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>results in:</p>

<p>dotnet/runtime#65926 eases the pain a tad. Some of the cost comes from looking up some cached
information in a hash table in the runtime, and as is the case with many map implementations, this
one involves computing a hash code and using a mod operation to map to the right bucket. Other
hash table implementations around dotnet/runtime, including Dictionary&lt;,&gt;, HashSet&lt;,&gt;, and
ConcurrentDictionary&lt;,&gt; previously switched to a “fastmod” implementation; this PR does the same
for this EEHashtable, which is used as part of the CORINFO_GENERIC_HANDLE JIT helper function
employed:</p>

<p>dotnet/runtime#60787. Loop alignment in .NET 6 provides a very nice exploration of why and
how the JIT handles loop alignment. This PR extends that further by trying to “hide” an emitted
align instruction behind an unconditional jmp that might already exist, in order to minimize the
impact of the processor having to fetch and decode nops.</p>

<p>GC</p>
<p>“Regions” is a feature of the garbage collector (GC) that’s been in the works for multiple years. It’s
enabled by default in 64-bit processes in .NET 7 as of dotnet/runtime#64688, but as with other multi-
year features, a multitude of PRs went into making it a reality. At a 30,000 foot level, “regions” replaces
the current “segments” approach to managing memory on the GC heap; rather than having a few
gigantic segments of memory (e.g. each 1GB), often associated 1:1 with a generation, the GC instead
maintains many, many smaller regions (e.g. each 4MB) as their own entity. This enables the GC to be
more agile with regards to operations like repurposing regions of memory from one generation to
another. For more information on regions, the blog post Put a DPAD on that GC! from the primary
developer on the GC is still the best resource.</p>

<p>Native AOT</p>
<p>To many people, the word “performance” in the context of software is about throughput. How fast
does something execute? How much data per second can it process? How many requests per second
can it process? And so on. But there are many other facets to performance. How much memory does
it consume? How fast does it start up and get to the point of doing something useful? How much
space does it consume on disk? How long would it take to download? And then there are related
concerns. In order to achieve these goals, what dependencies are required? What kinds of operations
does it need to perform to achieve these goals, and are all of those operations permitted in the target
environment? If any of this paragraph resonates with you, you are the target audience for the Native
AOT support now shipping in .NET 7.</p>
<p>.NET has long had support for AOT code generation. For example, .NET Framework had it in the form
of ngen, and .NET Core has it in the form of crossgen. Both of those solutions involve a standard .NET
executable that has some of its IL already compiled to assembly code, but not all methods will have
assembly code generated for them, various things can invalidate the assembly code that was
generated, external .NET assemblies without any native assembly code can be loaded, and so on, and
in all of those cases, the runtime continues to utilize a JIT compiler. Native AOT is different. It’s an
evolution of CoreRT, which itself was an evolution of .NET Native, and it’s entirely free of a JIT. The
binary that results from publishing a build is a completely standalone executable in the target
platform’s platform-specific file format (e.g. COFF on Windows, ELF on Linux, Mach-O on macOS) with
no external dependencies other than ones standard to that platform (e.g. libc). And it’s entirely native:
no IL in sight, no JIT, no nothing. All required code is compiled and/or linked in to the executable,
including the same GC that’s used with standard .NET apps and services, and a minimal runtime that
provides services around threading and the like. All of that brings great benefits: super fast startup
time, small and entirely-self contained deployment, and ability to run in places JIT compilers aren’t
allowed (e.g. because memory pages that were writable can’t then be executable). It also brings
limitations: no JIT means no dynamic loading of arbitrary assemblies (e.g. Assembly.LoadFile) and no
reflection emit (e.g. DynamicMethod), everything compiled and linked in to the app means the more
functionality that’s used (or might be used) the larger is your deployment, etc. Even with those
limitations, for a certain class of application, Native AOT is an incredibly exciting and welcome
addition to .NET 7.</p>
<p>Too many PRs to mention have gone into bringing up the Native AOT stack, in part because it’s been
in the works for years (as part of the archived dotnet/corert project and then as part of
dotnet/runtimelab/feature/NativeAOT) and in part because there have been over a hundred PRs just
in dotnet/runtime that have gone into bringing Native AOT up to a shippable state since the code was
originally brought over from dotnet/runtimelab in dotnet/runtime#62563 and dotnet/runtime#62563.
Between that and there not being a previous version to compare its performance to, instead of
focusing PR by PR on improvements, let’s just look at how to use it and the benefits it brings.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>CHAPTER 4 | Native AOT</p>
<p>Today, Native AOT is focused on console applications, so let’s create a console app:</p>
<p>dotnet new console -o nativeaotexample</p>
<p>We now have our nativeaotexample directory containing a nativeaotexample.csproj and a “hello,
world” Program.cs. To enable publishing the application with Native AOT, edit the .csproj to include
this in the existing <PropertyGroup>...</PropertyGroup>.</p>
<p><PublishAot>true</PublishAot></p>
<p>And then… actually, that’s it. Our app is now fully configured to be able to target Native AOT. All that’s
left is to publish. As I’m currently writing this on my Windows x64 machine, I’ll target that:</p>
<p>dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release</p>
<p>I now have my generated executable in the output publish directory:</p>
<pre><code>Directory: C:\nativeaotexample\bin\Release\net7.0\win-x64\publish
</code></pre>
<p>Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
-a---           8/27/2022  6:19 PM        2061824 nativeaotexample.exe
-a---           8/27/2022  6:19 PM       14290944 nativeaotexample.pdb</p>
<p>so 2M instead of 3.5MB. Of course, for that significant reduction I’ve given up some things:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Setting InvariantGlobalization to true means I’m now not respecting culture information and
am instead using a set of invariant data for most globalization operations.</p>
<p>Setting UseSystemResourceKeys to true means nice exception messages are stripped away.</p>
<p>Setting IlcGenerateStackTraceData to false means I’m going to get fairly poor stack traces
should I need to debug an exception.</p>
<p>Setting DebuggerSupport to false… good luck debugging things.</p>
<p>… you get the idea.</p>
<p>One of the potentially mind-boggling aspects of Native AOT for a developer used to .NET is that, as it
says on the tin, it really is native. After publishing the app, there is no IL involved, and there’s no JIT
that could even process it. This makes some of the other investments in .NET 7 all the more valuable,
for example everywhere investments are happening in source generators. Code that previously relied
on reflection emit for good performance will need another scheme. We can see that, for example, with
Regex. Historically for optimal throughput with Regex, it’s been recommended to use
RegexOptions.Compiled, which uses reflection emit at run-time to generate an optimized
implementation of the specified pattern. But if you look at the implementation of the Regex
constructor, you’ll find this nugget:</p>
<p>if (RuntimeFeature.IsDynamicCodeCompiled)
{
factory = Compile(pattern, tree, options, matchTimeout != InfiniteMatchTimeout);
}</p>
<p>With the JIT, IsDynamicCodeCompiled is true. But with Native AOT, it’s false. Thus, with Native AOT
and Regex, there’s no difference between specifying RegexOptions.Compiled and not, and another
mechanism is required to get the throughput benefits promised by RegexOptions.Compiled. Enter
[GeneratedRegex(...)], which, along with the new regex source generator shipping in the .NET 7</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>CHAPTER 4 | Native AOT</p>
<p>SDK, emits C# code into the assembly using it. That C# code takes the place of the reflection emit that
would have happened at run-time, and is thus able to work successfully with Native AOT.</p>

<p>So, yes, there are some constraints associated with Native AOT, but there are also solutions for
working with those constraints. And further, those constraints can actually bring further benefits.
Consider dotnet/runtime#64497. Remember how we talked about “guarded devirtualization” in
dynamic PGO, where via instrumentation the JIT can determine the most likely type to be used at a
given call site and special-case it? With Native AOT, the entirety of the program is known at compile
time, with no support for Assembly.LoadFrom or the like. That means at compile time, the compiler
can do whole-program analysis to determine what types implement what interfaces. If a given
interface only has a single type that implements it, then every call site through that interface can be
unconditionally devirtualized, without any type-check guards.</p>
<p>This is a really exciting space, one we expect to see flourish in coming releases.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>CHAPTER 4 | Native AOT</p>
<p>CHAPTER  5</p>
<p>Mono</p>
<p>Up until now I’ve referred to “the JIT,” “the GC,” and “the runtime,” but in reality there are actually
multiple runtimes in .NET. I’ve been talking about “coreclr,” which is the runtime that’s recommended
for use on Linux, macOS, and Windows. However, there’s also “mono,” which powers Blazor wasm
applications, Android apps, and iOS apps. It’s also seen significant improvements in .NET 7.</p>
<p>Just as with coreclr (which can JIT compile, AOT compile partially with JIT fallback, and fully Native
AOT compile), mono has multiple ways of actually executing code. One of those ways is an interpreter,
which enables mono to execute .NET code in environments that don’t permit JIT’ing and without
requiring ahead-of-time compilation or incurring any limitations it may bring. Interestingly, though,
the interpreter is itself almost a full-fledged compiler, parsing the IL, generating its own intermediate
representation (IR) for it, and doing one or more optimization passes over that IR; it’s just that at the
end of the pipeline when a compiler would normally emit code, the interpreter instead saves off that
data for it to interpret when the time comes to run. As such, the interpreter has a very similar
conundrum to the one we discussed with coreclr’s JIT: the time it takes to optimize vs the desire to
start up quickly. And in .NET 7, the interpreter employs a similar solution: tiered compilation.
dotnet/runtime#68823 adds the ability for the interpreter to initially compile with minimal
optimization of that IR, and then once a certain threshold of call counts has been hit, then take the
time to do as much optimization on the IR as possible for all future invocations of that method. This
yields the same benefits as it does for coreclr: improved startup time while also having efficient
sustained throughput. When this merged, we saw improvements in Blazor wasm app startup time
improve by 10-20%. Here’s one example from an app being tracked in our benchmarking system:</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>CHAPTER 5 | Mono</p>
<p>The interpreter isn’t just used for entire apps, though. Just as how coreclr can use the JIT when an R2R
image doesn’t contain code for a method, mono can use the interpreter when there’s no AOT code
for a method. Once such case that occurred on mono was with generic delegate invocation, where the
presence of a generic delegate being invoked would trigger falling back to the interpreter; for .NET 7,
that gap was addressed with dotnet/runtime#70653. A more impactful case, however, is
dotnet/runtime#64867. Previously, any methods with catch or filter exception handling clauses
couldn’t be AOT compiled and would fall back to being interpreted. With this PR, the method is now
able to be AOT compiled, and it only falls back to using the interpreter when an exception actually
occurs, switching over to the interpreter for the remainder of that method call’s execution. Since many
methods contain such clauses, this can make a big difference in throughput and CPU consumption. In
the same vein, dotnet/runtime#63065 enabled methods with finally exception handling clauses to
be AOT compiled; just the finally block gets interpreted rather than the entire method being
interpreted.</p>
<p>Beyond such backend improvements, another class of improvement came from further unification
between coreclr and mono. Years ago, coreclr and mono had their own entire library stack built on
top of them. Over time, as .NET was open sourced, portions of mono’s stack got replaced by shared
components, bit by bit. Fast forward to today, all of the core .NET libraries above
System.Private.CoreLib are the same regardless of which runtime is being employed. In fact, the
source for CoreLib itself is almost entirely shared, with ~95% of the source files being compiled into
the CoreLib that’s built for each runtime, and just a few percent of the source specialized for each
(these statements means that the vast majority of the performance improvements discussed in the
rest of this post apply equally whether running on mono and coreclr). Even so, every release now we
try to chip away at that few remaining percent, for reasons of maintainability, but also because the
source used for coreclr’s CoreLib has generally had more attention paid to it from a performance
perspective. dotnet/runtime#71325, for example, moves mono’s array and span sorting generic
sorting utility class over to the more efficient implementation used by coreclr.</p>
<p>One of the biggest categories of improvements, however, is in vectorization. This comes in two pieces.
First, Vector<T> and Vector128<T> are now fully accelerated on both x64 and Arm64, thanks to PRs
like dotnet/runtime#64961, dotnet/runtime#65086, dotnet/runtime#65128, dotnet/runtime#66317,</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>CHAPTER 5 | Mono</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#66391, dotnet/runtime#66409, dotnet/runtime#66512, dotnet/runtime#66586,
dotnet/runtime#66589, dotnet/runtime#66597, dotnet/runtime#66476, and dotnet/runtime#67125;
that significant amount of work means all that code that gets vectorized using these abstractions will
light-up on mono and coreclr alike. Second, thanks primarily to dotnet/runtime#70086, mono now
knows how to translate Vector128<T> operations to WASM’s SIMD instruction set, such that code
vectorized with Vector128<T> will also be accelerated when running in Blazor wasm applications and
anywhere else WASM might be executed.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>CHAPTER 5 | Mono</p>
<p>CHAPTER  6</p>
<p>Reflection</p>
<p>Reflection is one of those areas you either love or hate (I find it a bit humorous to be writing this
section immediately after writing the Native AOT section). It’s immensely powerful, providing the
ability to query all of the metadata for code in your process and for arbitrary assemblies you might
encounter, to invoke arbitrary functionality dynamically, and even to emit dynamically-generated IL at
run-time. It’s also difficult to handle well in the face of tooling like a linker or a solution like Native
AOT that needs to be able to determine at build time exactly what code will be executed, and it’s
generally quite expensive at run-time; thus it’s both something we strive to avoid when possible but
also invest in reducing the costs of, as it’s so popular in so many different kinds of applications
because it is incredibly useful. As with most releases, it’s seen some nice improvements in .NET 7.</p>
<p>One of the most impacted areas is reflection invoke. Available via MethodBase.Invoke, this
functionality let’s you take a MethodBase (e.g. MethodInfo) object that represents some method for
which the caller previously queried, and call it, with arbitrary arguments that the runtime needs to
marshal through to the callee, and with an arbitrary return value that needs to be marshaled back. If
you know the signature of the method ahead of time, the best way to optimize invocation speed is to
create a delegate from the MethodBase via CreateDelegate<T> and then use that delegate for all
future invocations. But in some circumstances, you don’t know the signature at compile time, and thus
can’t easily rely on delegates with known matching signatures. To address this, some libraries have
taken to using reflection emit to generate code at run-time specific to the target method. This is
extremely complicated and it’s not something we want apps to have to do. Instead, in .NET 7 via
dotnet/runtime#66357, dotnet/runtime#69575, and dotnet/runtime#74614, Invoke will itself use
reflection emit (in the form of DynamicMethod) to generate a delegate that is customized for invoking
the target, and then future invocation via that MethodInfo will utilize that generated method. This
gives developers most of the performance benefits of a custom reflection emit-based implementation
but without having the complexity or challenges of such an implementation in their own code base.</p>

<p>Reflection also involves lots of manipulation of objects that represent types, methods, properties, and
so on, and tweaks here and there can add up to a measurable difference when using these APIs. For
example, I’ve talked in past performance posts about how, potentially counterintuitively, one of the
ways we’ve achieved performance boosts is by porting native code from the runtime back into
managed C#. There are a variety of ways in which doing so can help performance, but one is that
there is some overhead associated with calling from managed code into the runtime, and eliminating
such hops avoids that overhead. This can be seen in full effect in dotnet/runtime#71873, which moves
several of these “FCalls” related to Type, RuntimeType (the Type-derived class used by the runtime to
represent its types), and Enum out of native into managed.</p>

<p>Another example of this phenomenon comes in dotnet/runtime#62866, which moved much of the
underlying support for AssemblyName out of native runtime code into managed code in CoreLib. That
in turn has an impact on anything that uses it, such as when using Activator.CreateInstance
overloads that take assembly names that need to be parsed.</p>
<p>private readonly string _assemblyName = typeof(MyClass).Assembly.FullName;
private readonly string _typeName = typeof(MyClass).FullName;

dotnet/runtime#67148 removed several array and list allocations from inside of the
RuntimeType.CreateInstanceImpl method that’s used by CreateInstance (using Type.EmptyTypes
instead of allocating a new Type[0], avoiding unnecessarily turning a builder into an array, etc.),
resulting in less allocation and faster throughput.</p>

<p>There are also improvements that are hard to see but that remove overheads as part of populating
reflection’s caches, which end up reducing the work done typically on startup paths, helping apps to
launch faster. dotnet/runtime#66825, dotnet/runtime#66912, and dotnet/runtime#67149 all fall into

<p>Interop</p>
<p>.NET has long had great support for interop, enabling .NET applications to consume huge amounts of
functionality written in other languages and/or exposed by the underlying operating system. The
bedrock of this support has been “Platform Invoke,” or “P/Invoke,” represented in code by
[DllImport(...)] applied to methods. The DllImportAttribute enables declaring a method that
can be called like any other .NET method but that actually represents some external method that the
runtime should call when this managed method is invoked. The DllImport specifies details about in
what library the function lives, what its actual name is in the exports from that library, high-level
details about marshalling of input arguments and return values, and so on, and the runtime ensures
all the right things happen. This mechanism works on all operating systems. For example, Windows
has a method CreatePipe for creating an anonymous pipe:</p>
<p>BOOL CreatePipe(
[out]          PHANDLE               hReadPipe,
[out]          PHANDLE               hWritePipe,
[in, optional] LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpPipeAttributes,
[in]           DWORD                 nSize
);</p>
<p>If I want to call this function from C#, I can declare a [DllImport(...)] counterpart to it which I can
then invoke as I can any other managed method:</p>
<p>[DllImport(&quot;kernel32&quot;, SetLastError = true)]
[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]
private static unsafe extern bool CreatePipe(
out SafeFileHandle hReadPipe,
out SafeFileHandle hWritePipe,
void* lpPipeAttributes,
uint nSize);</p>
<p>There are several interesting things to note here. Several of the arguments are directly blittable with
the same representation on the managed and native side of the equation, e.g. lpPipeAttributes is a
pointer and nSize is a 32-bit integer. But what about the return value? The bool type in C#
(System.Boolean) is a one-byte type, but the BOOL type in the native signature is four bytes; thus code
calling this managed method can’t just directly invoke the native function somehow, as there needs to
be some “marshalling” logic that converts the four-byte return BOOL into the one-byte return bool.
Simiarly, the native function has two out pointers for hReadPipe and hWritePipe, but the managed
signature declares two SafeFileHandles (a SafeHandle is a .NET type that wraps a pointer and
provides a finalizer and Dispose method for ensuring that pointer is appropriately cleaned up when
it’s no longer being used). Some logic needs to take the output handles generated by the native
function and wrap them into these SafeFileHandles to be output from the managed method. And
what about that SetLastError = true? .NET has methods like Marshal.GetLastPInvokeError(),</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7 | Interop</p>
<p>and some code somewhere needs to take any error produced by this method and ensure it’s available
for consumption via a subsequent GetLastPInvokeError().</p>
<p>If there’s no marshalling logic required, such that the managed signature and native signature are for
all intents and purposes the same, all arguments blittable, all return values blittable, no additional
logic required around the invocation of the method, etc., then a [DllImport(...)] ends up being a
simple passthrough with the runtime needing to do very little work to implement it. If, however, the
[DllImport(...)] involves any of this marshalling work, the runtime needs to generate a “stub,”
creating a dedicated method that’s called when the [DllImport(...)] is called, that handles fixing
up all inputs, that delegates to the actual native function, and that fixes up all of the outputs. That
stub is generated at execution time, with the runtime effectively doing reflection emit, generating IL
dynamically that’s then JIT’d.</p>
<p>There are a variety of downsides to this. First, it takes time to generate all that marshalling code, time
which can then negatively impact user experience for things like startup. Second, the nature of its
implementation inhibits various optimizations, such as inlining. Third, there are platforms that don’t
allow for JIT’ing due to the security exposure of allowing for dynamically generated code to then be
executed (or in the case of Native AOT, where there isn’t a JIT at all). And fourth, it’s all hidden away
making it more challenging for a developer to really understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>But what if that logic could all be generated at build time rather than at run time? The cost of
generating the code would be incurred only at build time and not on every execution. The code would
effectively just end up being user code that has all of the C# compiler’s and runtime’s optimizations
available to it. The code, which then would just be part of the app, would be able to be ahead-of-time
compiled using whatever AOT system is desirable, whether it be crossgen or Native AOT or some
other system. And the code would be inspectable, viewable by users to understand exactly what work
is being done on their behalf. Sounds pretty desirable. Sounds magical. Sounds like a job for a Roslyn
source generator, mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>.NET 6 included several source generators in the .NET SDK, and .NET 7 doubles down on this effort
including several more. One of these is the brand new LibraryImport generator, which provides exactly
the magical, desirable solution we were just discussing.</p>
<p>Let’s return to our previous CreatePipe example. We’ll make two small tweaks. We change the
attribute from DllImport to LibraryImport, and we change the extern keyword to be partial:</p>
<p>[LibraryImport(&quot;kernel32&quot;, SetLastError = true)]
[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]
private static unsafe partial bool CreatePipe(
out SafeFileHandle hReadPipe,
out SafeFileHandle hWritePipe,
void* lpPipeAttributes,
uint nSize);</p>
<p>Now if you’re following along at home in Visual Studio, try right-clicking on CreatePipe and selecting
Go to Definition. That might seem a little strange. “Go to Definition? Isn’t this the definition?” This is a
partial method, which is a way of declaring something that another partial definition fills in, and in this
case, a source generator in .NET 7 SDK has noticed this method with the [LibraryImport] attribute
and fully generated the entire marshalling stub code in C# that’s built directly into the assembly.
While by default that code isn’t persisted, Visual Studio still enables you to browse it (and you can</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7 | Interop</p>
<p>opt-in to having it persisted on disk by adding a
<EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles>true</EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles> property into your .csproj).
Here’s what it currently looks like for that method:</p>
<p>[System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute(&quot;Microsoft.Interop.LibraryImportGenerator&quot;,

}</p>
<p>With this, you can read exactly the marshalling work that’s being performed. Two SafeHandle
instances are being allocated and then later after the native function completes, the
Marshal.InitHandle method is used to store the resulting handles into these instances (the
allocations happen before the native function call, as performing them after the native handles have
already been produced increases the chances of a leak if the SafeHandle allocation fails due to an
out-of-memory situation). The BOOL to bool conversion happens via a != 0 comparison. And the error
information is captured by calling Marshal.GetLastSystemError() just after the native function call
and then Marshal.SetLastPInvokeError(int) just prior to returning. The actual native function call
is still implemented with a [DllImport(...)], but now that P/Invoke is blittable and doesn’t require
any stub to be generated by the runtime, as all that work has been handled in this C# code.</p>
<p>A sheer ton of work went in to enabling this. I touched on some of it last year in Performance
Improvements in .NET 6, but a significant amount of additional effort has gone into .NET 7 to polish
the design and make the implementation robust, roll it out across all of dotnet/runtime and beyond,
and expose the functionality for all C# developers to use:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The LibraryImport generator started its life as an experiment in dotnet/runtimelab. When it was
ready, dotnet/runtime#59579 brought 180 commits spanning years of effort into the
dotnet/runtime main branch.</p>
<p>In .NET 6, there were almost 3000 [DllImport] uses throughout the core .NET libraries. As of my
writing this, in .NET 7 there are… let me search… wait for it… 7 (I was hoping I could say 0, but
there are just a few stragglers, mostly related to COM interop, still remaining). That’s not a
transformation that happens over night. A multitude of PRs went library by library converting
from the old to the new, such as dotnet/runtime#62295 and dotnet/runtime#61640 for
System.Private.CoreLib, dotnet/runtime#61742 and dotnet/runtime#62309 for the cryptography
libraries, dotnet/runtime#61765 for networking, dotnet/runtime#61996 and
dotnet/runtime#61638 for most of the other I/O-related libraries, and a long-tail of additional
porting in dotnet/runtime#61975, dotnet/runtime#61389, dotnet/runtime#62353,
dotnet/runtime#61990, dotnet/runtime#61949, dotnet/runtime#61805, dotnet/runtime#61741,
dotnet/runtime#61184, dotnet/runtime#54290, dotnet/runtime#62365, dotnet/runtime#61609,
dotnet/runtime#61532, and dotnet/runtime#54236.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Such porting is significantly easier when there’s a tool to help automate it.
dotnet/runtime#72819 enables the analyzer and fixer for performing these transformations.
:::{custom-style=Figure}</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7 | Interop</p>
<p>:::</p>
<p>There were plenty of other PRs that went into making the LibraryImport generator a reality for .NET 7.
To highlight just a few more, dotnet/runtime#63320 introduces a new
[DisabledRuntimeMarshalling] attribute that can be specified at the assembly level to disable all of
the runtime’s built-in marshalling; at that point, the only marshalling performed as part of interop is
the marshaling done in the user’s code, e.g. that which is generated by [LibraryImport]. Other PRs
like dotnet/runtime#67635 and dotnet/runtime#68173 added new marshaling types that encompass
common marshaling logic and can be referenced from [LibraryImport(...)] use to customize how
marshaling is performed (the generator is pattern-based and allows for customization of marshalling
by providing types that implement the right shape, which these types do in support of the most
common marshalling needs). Really usefully, dotnet/runtime#71989 added support for marshaling
{ReadOnly}Span<T>, such that spans can be used directly in [LibraryImport(...)] method
signatures, just as arrays can be (examples in dotnet/runtime are available in dotnet/runtime#73256).
And dotnet/runtime#69043 consolidated logic to be shared between the runtime’s marshalling
support in [DllImport] and the generators support with [LibraryImport].</p>
<p>One more category of interop-related changes that I think are worth talking about are to do with
SafeHandle cleanup. As a reminder, SafeHandle exists to mitigate various issues around managing
native handles and file descriptors. A native handle or file descriptor is just a memory address or
number that refers to some owned resource and which must be cleaned up / closed when done with
it. A SafeHandle at its core is just a managed object that wraps such a value and provides a Dispose
method and a finalizer for closing it. That way, if you neglect to Dispose of the SafeHandle in order to
close the resource, the resource will still be cleaned up when the SafeHandle is garbage collected and
its finalizer eventually run. SafeHandle then also provides some synchronization around that closure,
trying to minimize the possibility that the resource is closed while it’s still in use. It provides
DangerousAddRef and DangerousRelease methods that increment and decrement a ref count,
respectively, and if Dispose is called while the ref count is above zero, the actual releasing of the
handle triggered by Dispose is delayed until the ref count goes back to 0. When you pass a
SafeHandle into a P/Invoke, the generated code for that P/Invoke handles calling DangerousAddRef</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7 | Interop</p>
<p>and DangerousRelease (and due to the wonders of LibraryImport I’ve already extolled, you can easily
see that being done, such as in the previous generated code example). Our code tries hard to clean
up after SafeHandles deterministically, but it’s quite easy to accidentally leave some for finalization.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#71854 added some debug-only tracking code to SafeHandle to make it easier for
developers working in dotnet/runtime (or more specifically, developers using a checked build of the
runtime) to find such issues. When the SafeHandle is constructed, it captures the current stack trace,
and if the SafeHandle is finalized, it dumps that stack trace to the console, making it easy to see
where SafeHandles that do end up getting finalized were created, in order to track them down and
ensure they’re being disposed of. As is probably evident from that PR touching over 150 files and
almost 1000 lines of code, there were quite a few places that benefited from clean up. Now to be fair,
many of these are on exceptional code paths. For example, consider a hypothetical P/Invoke like:</p>
<p>[LibraryImport(&quot;SomeLibrary&quot;, SetLastError = true)]
internal static partial SafeFileHandle CreateFile();</p>
<p>and code that uses it like:</p>
<p>SafeFileHandle handle = Interop.CreateFile();
if (handle.IsInvalid)
{
throw new UhOhException(Marshal.GetLastPInvokeError());
}
return handle;</p>
<p>Seems straightforward enough. Except this code will actually leave a SafeHandle for finalization on
the failure path. It doesn’t matter that SafeHandle has an invalid handle in it, it’s still a finalizable
object. To deal with that, this code would have been more robustly written as:</p>
<p>SafeFileHandle handle = Interop.CreateFile();
if (handle.IsInvalid)
{
int lastError = Marshal.GetLastPInvokeError();
handle.Dispose(); // or handle.SetHandleAsInvalid()
throw new UhOhException(lastError);
}
return handle;</p>
<p>That way, this SafeHandle won’t create finalization pressure even in the case of failure. Note, as well,
that as part of adding in the Dispose call, I also moved the Marshal.GetLastPInvokeError() up.
That’s because calling Dispose on a SafeHandle may end up invoking the SafeHandle’s
ReleaseHandle method, which the developer of the SafeHandle-derived type will have overridden to
close the resource, which typically involves making another P/Invoke. And if that P/Invoke has
SetLastError=true on it, it can overwrite the very error code for which we’re about to throw. Hence,
we access and store the last error immediately after the interop call once we know it failed, then clean
up, and only then throw. All that said, there were a myriad of places in that PR where SafeHandles
were being left for finalization even on the success path. And that PR wasn’t alone.
dotnet/runtime#71991, dotnet/runtime#71854, dotnet/runtime#72116, dotnet/runtime#72189,
dotnet/runtime#72222, dotnet/runtime#72203, and dotnet/runtime#72279 all found and fixed many
occurrences of SafeHandles being left for finalization (many thanks to the diagnostics put in place in
the earlier mentioned PR).</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7 | Interop</p>
<p>Other PRs also accrued to improved interop performance. dotnet/runtime#70000 from
<a href="https://github.com/huoyaoyuan">@huoyaoyuan</a> rewrote several delegate-related “FCalls” from being
implemented in native code to instead being managed, resulting in less overhead when invoking
these operations that are commonly involved in scenarios involving
Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer. dotnet/runtime#68694 also moved some trivial
functionality from native to managed, as part of relaxing argument validation on the use of pinning
handles. This in turn measurably reduced the overhead involved with using GCHandle.Alloc for such
pinning handles:</p>
<p>private byte[] _buffer = new byte[1024];</p>

<p>CHAPTER  8</p>
<p>Threading</p>
<p>Threading is one of those cross-cutting concerns that impacts every application, such that changes in
the threading space can have a wide-spread impact. This release sees two very substantial changes to
the ThreadPool itself; dotnet/runtime#64834 switches the “IO pool” over to using an entirely
managed implementation (whereas previously the IO pool was still in native code even though the
worker pool had been moved entirely to managed in previous releases), and dotnet/runtime#71864
similarly switches the timer implementation from one based in native to one entirely in managed
code. Those two changes can impact performance, and the former was demonstrated to on larger
hardware, but for the most part that wasn’t their primary goal. Instead, other PRs have been focused
on improving throughput.</p>
<p>One in particular is dotnet/runtime#69386. The ThreadPool has a “global queue” that any thread can
queue work into, and then each thread in the pool has its own “local queue” (which any thread can
dequeue from but only the owning thread can enqueue into). When a worker needs another piece of
work to process, it first checks its own local queue, then it checks the global queue, and then only if it
couldn’t find work in either of those two places, it goes and checks all of the other threads’ local
queues to see if it can help lighten their load. As machines scale up to have more and more cores, and
more and more threads, there’s more and more contention on these shared queues, and in particular
on the global queue. This PR addresses this for such larger machines by introducing additional global
queues once the machine reaches a certain threshold (32 processors today). This helps to partition
accesses across multiple queues, thereby decreasing contention.</p>
<p>Another is dotnet/runtime#57885. In order to coordinate threads, when work items were enqueued
and dequeued, the pool was issuing requests to its threads to let them know that there was work
available to do. This, however, often resulted in oversubscription, where more threads than necessary
would race to try to get work items, especially when the system wasn’t at full load. That in turn would
manifest as a throughput regression. This change overhauls how threads are requested, such that only
one additional thread is requested at a time, and after that thread has dequeued its first work item, it
can issue a request for an additional thread if there’s work remaining, and then that one can issue an
additional request, and so on. Here’s one of our performance tests in our performance test suite (I’ve
simplified it down to remove a bunch of configuration options from the test, but it’s still accurately
one of those configurations). At first glance you might think, “hey, this is a performance test about
ArrayPool, why is it showing up in a threading discussion?” And, you’d be right, this is a performance
test that was written focused on ArrayPool. However, as mentioned earlier, threading impacts
everything, and in this case, that await Task.Yield() in the middle there causes the remainder of
this method to be queued to the ThreadPool for execution. And because of how the test is structured,
doing “real work” that competes for CPU cycles with thread pool threads all racing to get their next
task, it shows a measurable improvement when moving to .NET 7.</p>

<p>There have been improvements outside of ThreadPool, as well. One notable change is in the handling
of AsyncLocal<T>s, in dotnet/runtime#68790. AsyncLocal<T> is integrated tightly with
ExecutionContext; in fact, in .NET Core, ExecutionContext is entirely about flowing AsyncLocal<T>
instances. An ExecutionContext instance maintains a single field, a map data structure, that stores
the data for all AsyncLocal<T> with data present in that context. Each AsyncLocal<T> has an object it
uses as a key, and any gets or sets on that AsyncLocal<T> manifest as getting the current
ExecutionContext, looking up that AsyncLocal<T>’s key in the context’s dictionary, and then either
returning whatever data it finds, or in the case of a setter, creating a new ExecutionContext with an
updated dictionary and publishing that back. This dictionary thus needs to be very efficient for reads
and writes, as developers expect AsyncLocal<T> access to be as fast as possible, often treating it as if
it were any other local. So, to optimize these lookups, the representation of that dictionary changes
based on how many AsyncLocal<T>s are represented in this context. For up to three items, dedicated
implementations with fields for each of the three keys and values were used. Above that up to around
16 elements, an array of key/value pairs was used. And above that, a Dictionary&lt;,&gt; was used. For the
most part, this has worked well, with the majority of ExecutionContexts being able to represent
many flows with one of the first three types. However, it turns out that four active AsyncLocal<T>
instances is really common, especially in ASP.NET where ASP.NET infrastructure itself uses a couple.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>CHAPTER 8 | Threading</p>
<p>So, this PR took the complexity hit to add a dedicated type for four key/value pairs, in order to
optimize from one to four of them rather than one to three. While this improves throughput a bit, its
main intent was to improve allocation, which is does over .NET 6 by ~20%.</p>

<p>Another valuable fix comes for locking in dotnet/runtime#70165. This particular improvement is a bit
harder to demonstrate with benchmarkdotnet, so just try running this program, first on .NET 6 and
then on .NET 7:</p>
<p>using System.Diagnostics;</p>

{

}
});
}</p>

<p>}</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>CHAPTER 8 | Threading</p>
<p>This is simply spinning up 100 tasks, each of which enters and exits a read-write lock, waits for them
all, and then does the process over again, for 10 seconds. It also times how long it takes to enter and
exit the lock, and writes a warning if it had to wait for at least 15ms. When I run this on .NET 6, I get
~100 occurrences of it taking &gt;= 10 ms to enter/exit the lock. On .NET 7, I get 0 occurrences. Why the
difference? The implementation of ReaderWriterLockSlim has its own spin loop implementation, and
that spin loop tries to mix together various things to do as it spins, ranging from calling
Thread.SpinWait to Thread.Sleep(0) to Thread.Sleep(1). The issue lies in the Thread.Sleep(1).
That’s saying “put this thread to sleep for 1 millisecond”; however, the operating system has the
ultimate say on such timings, and on Windows, by default that sleep is going to be closer to 15
milliseconds (on Linux it’s a bit lower but still quite high). Thus, every time there was enough
contention on the lock to force it to call Thread.Sleep(1), we’d incur a delay of at least 15
milliseconds, if not more. The aforementioned PR fixed this by eliminating use of Thread.Sleep(1).</p>
<p>One final threading-related change to call out: dotnet/runtime#68639. This one is Windows specific.
Windows has the concept of processor groups, each of which can have up to 64 cores in it, and by
default when a process runs, it’s assigned a specific processor group and can only use the cores in
that group. With .NET 7, the runtime flips its default so that by default it will try to use all processor
groups if possible.</p>

<p>CHAPTER  9</p>
<p>Primitive Types and
Numerics</p>
<p>We’ve looked at code generation and GC, at threading and vectorization, at interop… let’s turn our
attention to some of the fundamental types in the system. Primitives like int and bool and double,
core types like Guid and DateTime, they form the backbone on which everything is built, and every
release it’s exciting to see the improvements that find their way into these types.</p>
<p>float and double got a very nice boost in their implementation of parsing (e.g. double.Parse,
float.TryParse, etc.). dotnet/runtime#62301 from <a href="https://github.com/CarlVerret">@CarlVerret</a>
significantly improves double.Parse and float.Parse for parsing UTF16 text into floating-point
values. This is particularly neat because it’s based on some relatively recent research from
<a href="https://github.com/lemire">@lemire</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CarlVerret">@CarlVerret</a>, who used C#
with .NET 5 to implement a very fast implementation for parsing floating-point numbers, and that
implementation how now found its way into .NET 7!</p>

<p>bool.TryParse and bool.TryFormat were also improved. dotnet/runtime#64782 streamlined these
implementations by using BinaryPrimitives to perform fewer writes and reads. For example, instead
of TryFormat writing out “True” by doing:</p>
<p>destination[0] = 'T';
destination[1] = 'r';
destination[2] = 'u';
destination[3] = 'e';</p>
<p>which requires four writes, it can instead implement the same operation in a single write by doing:</p>
<p>BinaryPrimitives.WriteUInt64LittleEndian(MemoryMarshal.AsBytes(destination),
0x65007500720054); // &quot;True&quot;</p>
<p>That 0x65007500720054 is the numerical value of the four characters in memory as a single ulong. You
can see the impact of these changes with a microbenchmark:</p>

<p>Enum gets several performance boosts, as well. For example, when performing an operation like
Enum.IsDefined, Enum.GetName, or Enum.ToString, the implementation consults a cache of all of the
values defined on the enum. This cache includes the string name and the value for every defined
enumeration in the Enum. It’s also sorted by value in an array, so when one of these operations is
performed, the code uses Array.BinarySearch to find the index of the relevant entry. The issue with
that is one of overheads. When it comes to algorithmic complexity, a binary search is faster than a
linear search; after all, a binary search is O(log N) whereas a linear search is O(N). However, there’s
also less overhead for every step of the algorithm in a linear search, and so for smaller values of N, it
can be much faster to simply do the simple thing. That’s what dotnet/runtime#57973 does for enums.
For enums with less than or equal to 32 defined values, the implementation now just does a linear
search via the internal SpanHelpers.IndexOf (the worker routine behind IndexOf on spans, strings,</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>CHAPTER 9 | Primitive Types and Numerics</p>
<p>and arrays), and for enums with more than that, it does a SpanHelpers.BinarySearch (which is the
implementation for Array.BinarySearch).</p>

<p>Enums also get a boost in conjunction with Nullable<T> and EqualityComparer<T>.Default.
EqualityComparer<T>.Default caches a singleton instance of an EqualityComparer<T> instance
returned from all accesses to Default. That singleton is initialized based on the T in question, with the
implementation choosing from a multitude of different internal implementations, for example a
ByteArrayComparer specialized for bytes, a GenericEqualityComparer<T> for Ts that implement
IComparable<T>, and so on. The catch-all, for arbitrary types, is an ObjectEqualityComparer<T>. As it
happens, nullable enums would end up hitting this catch-all path, which means that every Equals call
would box the arguments. dotnet/runtime#68077 fixes this by ensuring nullable enums get mapped
to (an existing) specialized comparer for Nullable<T> and simple tweaks its definition to ensure it can
play nicely with enums. The results highlight just how much unnecessary overhead there was
previously.</p>

<p>Not to be left out, Guid’s equality operations also get faster, thanks to dotnet/runtime#66889 from
<a href="https://github.com/madelson">@madelson</a>. The previous implementation of Guid split the data into
four 32-bit values and performed 4 int comparisons. With this change, if the current hardware has
128-bit SIMD support, the implementation loads the data from the two guids as two vectors and
simply does a single comparison.</p>
<p>private Guid _guid1 = Guid.Parse(&quot;0aa2511d-251a-4764-b374-4b5e259b6d9a&quot;);

<p>DateTime equality is also improved. dotnet/runtime#59857 shaves some overhead off of
DateTime.Equals. DateTime is implemented with a single ulong _dateData field, where the majority
of the bits store a ticks offset from 1/1/0001 12:00am and where each tick is 100 nanoseconds, and
where the top two bits describe the DateTimeKind. Thus the public Ticks property returns the value
of _dateData but with the top two bits masked out, e.g. _dateData &amp; 0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. The
equality operators were all then just comparing one DateTime’s Ticks against the others, such that we
effectively get (dt1._dateData &amp; 0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) == (dt2._dateData &amp;
0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). However, as a micro-optimization that can instead be expressed more
efficiently as ((dt1._dateData ^ dt2._dateData) &lt;&lt; 2) == 0. It’s difficult to measure the
difference in such tiny operations, but you can see it simply from the number of instructions involved,
where on .NET 6 this produces:</p>
<p>; Program.DateTimeEquals()
mov       rax,[rcx+8]
mov       rdx,[rcx+10]
mov       rcx,0FFFFFFFFFFFF
and       rax,rcx
and       rdx,rcx
cmp       rax,rdx
sete      al
movzx     eax,al
ret
; Total bytes of code 34</p>
<p>and on .NET 7 this produces:</p>
<p>; Program.DateTimeEquals()
mov       rax,[rcx+8]
mov       rdx,[rcx+10]
xor       rax,rdx
shl       rax,2</p>

<p>CHAPTER 9 | Primitive Types and Numerics</p>
<p>sete      al
movzx     eax,al
ret
; Total bytes of code 22</p>
<p>so instead of a mov, and, and, and cmp, we get just an xor and a shl.</p>
<p>Other operations on DateTime also become more efficient, thanks to dotnet/runtime#72712 from
<a href="https://github.com/SergeiPavlov">@SergeiPavlov</a> and dotnet/runtime#73277 from
<a href="https://github.com/SergeiPavlov">@SergeiPavlov</a>. In another case of .NET benefiting from recent
advancements in research, these PRs implemented the algorithm from Neri and Schneider’s
“Euclidean Affine Functions and Applications to Calendar Algorithms” in order to improve
DateTime.Day, DateTime.DayOfYear, DateTime.Month, and DateTime.Year, as well as the internal
helper DateTime.GetDate() that’s used by a bunch of other methods like DateTime.AddMonths,
Utf8Formatter.TryFormat(DateTime, ...), DateTime.TryFormat, and DateTime.ToString.</p>

<p>So, we’ve touched on improvements to a few types, but the pièce de résistance around primitive types
in this release is “generic math,” which impacts almost every primitive type in .NET. There are
significant improvements here, some which have been in the making for literally over a decade.</p>
<p>There’s an excellent blog post from June dedicated just to generic math, so I won’t go into much
depth here. At a high level, however, there are now over 30 new interfaces that utilize the new C# 11
static abstract interface methods functionality, exposing wide-ranging operations from exponentiation
functions to trigonometric functions to standard numerical operators, all available via generics, such
that you can write one implementation that operates over these interfaces generically and have your</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>CHAPTER 9 | Primitive Types and Numerics</p>
<p>code applied to any types that implement the interfaces… which all of the numerical types in .NET 7
do (including not just the primitives but also, for example, BigInteger and Complex). A preview
version of this feature, including necessary runtime support, language syntax, C# compiler support,
generic interfaces, and interface implementations all shipped in .NET 6 and C# 10, but it wasn’t
supported for production use, and you had to download an experimental reference assembly in order
to get access. With dotnet/runtime#65731, all of this support moved into .NET 7 as supported
functionality. dotnet/runtime#66748, dotnet/runtime#67453, dotnet/runtime#69391,
dotnet/runtime#69582, dotnet/runtime#69756, and dotnet/runtime#71800 all updated the design
and implementation based on feedback from usage in .NET 6 and .NET 7 previews as well as a proper
API review with our API review team (a process every new API in .NET goes through before it’s
shipped publicly). dotnet/runtime#67714 added support for user-defined checked operators, a new
C# 11 feature that enables both unchecked and checked variations of operators to be exposed, with
the compiler picking the right one based on the checked context. dotnet/runtime#68096 also added
support for the new C# 11 unsigned right shift operator (&gt;&gt;&gt;). And dotnet/runtime#69651,
dotnet/runtime#67939, dotnet/runtime#73274, dotnet/runtime#71033, dotnet/runtime#71010,
dotnet/runtime#68251, dotnet/runtime#68217, and dotnet/runtime#68094 all added large swaths of
new public surface area for various operations, all with highly-efficient managed implementations, in
many cases based on the open source AMD Math Library.</p>
<p>While this support is all primarily intended for external consumers, the core libraries do consume
some of it internally. You can see how these APIs clean up consuming code even while maintaining
performance in PRs like dotnet/runtime#68226 and dotnet/runtime#68183, which use the interfaces
to deduplicate a bunch of LINQ code in Enumerable.Sum/Average/Min/Max. There are multiple
overloads of these methods for int, long, float, double, and decimal. The GitHub summary of the
diffs tells the story on how much code was able to be deleted:</p>
<p>Another simple example comes from the new System.Formats.Tar library in .NET 7, which as the
name suggests is used for reading and writing archives in any of multiple tar file formats. The tar file
formats include integer values in octal representation, so the TarReader class needs to parse octal
values. Some of these values are 32-bit integers, and some are 64-bit integers. Rather than have two
separate ParseOctalAsUInt32 and ParseOctalAsUInt64 methods, dotnet/runtime#74281]
consolidated the methods into a single ParseOctal<T> with the constraint where T : struct,
INumber<T>. The implementation is then entirely in terms of T and can be used for either of these
types (plus any other types meeting the constraints, should that ever be needed). What’s particularly
interesting about this example is the ParseOctal<T> method includes use of checked, e.g. value =
checked((value * octalFactor) + T.CreateTruncating(digit));. This is only possible because
C# 11 includes the aforementioned support for user-defined checked operators, enabling the generic
math interfaces to support both the normal and checked varieties, e.g. the IMultiplyOperators&lt;,,&gt;
interface contains these methods:</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>CHAPTER 9 | Primitive Types and Numerics</p>
<p>static abstract TResult operator *(TSelf left, TOther right);
static virtual TResult operator checked *(TSelf left, TOther right) =&gt; left * right;</p>
<p>and the compiler will pick the appropriate one based on the context.</p>
<p>In addition to all the existing types that get these interfaces, there are also new types.
dotnet/runtime#69204 adds the new Int128 and UInt128 types. As these types implement all of the
relevant generic math interfaces, they come complete with a huge number of methods, over 100 each,
all of which are implemented efficiently in managed code. In the future, the aim is that some set of
these will be optimized further by the JIT and to take advantage of hardware acceleration.</p>
<p>Several PRs moved native implementations of these kinds of math operations to managed code.
dotnet/runtime#63881 from <a href="https://github.com/am11">@am11</a> did so for Math.Abs and Math.AbsF
(absolute value), and dotnet/runtime#56236 from
<a href="https://github.com/alexcovington">@alexcovington</a> did so for Math.ILogB and MathF.ILogB (base 2
integer logarithm). The latter’s implementation is based on the MUSL libc implementation of the same
algorithm, and in addition to improving performance (in part by avoiding the transition between
managed and native code, in part by the actual algorithm employed), it also enabled deleting two
distinct implementations from native code, one from the coreclr side and one from the mono side,
which is always a nice win from a maintainability perspective.</p>

<p>Other math operations were also improved in various ways. Math{F}.Truncate was improved in
dotnet/runtime#65014 from <a href="https://github.com/MichalPetryka">@MichalPetryka</a> by making it into a
JIT intrinsic, such that on Arm64 the JIT could directly emit a frintz instruction.
dotnet/runtime#65584 did the same for Max and Min so that the Arm-specific fmax and fmin
instructions could be used. And several BitConverter APIs were also turned into intrinsics in
dotnet/runtime#71567 in order to enable better code generation in some generic math scenarios.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#55121 from <a href="https://github.com/key-moon">@key-moon</a> also improves parsing, but
for BigInteger, and more specifically for really, really big BigIntegers. The algorithm previously
employed for parsing a string into a BigInteger was O(N^2) where N is the number of digits, but
while a larger algorithmic complexity than we’d normally like, it has a low constant overhead and so is
still reasonable for reasonably-sized values. In contrast, an alternative algorithm is available that runs
in O(N * (log N)^2) time, but with a much higher constant factor involved. That makes is so that it’s
really only worth switching for really big numbers. Which is what this PR does. It implements the
alternative algorithm and switches over to it when the input is at least 20,000 digits (so, yes, big). But
for such large numbers, it makes a significant difference.</p>

spans rather than arrays. That in turn enabled a fair amount of use of stack allocation and slicing to
avoid allocation overheads, while also improving reliability and safety by moving some code away
from unsafe pointers to safe spans. The primary performance impact is visible in allocation numbers,
and in particular for operations related to division.</p>

<p>Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>While there are many forms of computation that can consume resources in applications, some of the
most common include processing of data stored in arrays, strings, and now spans. Thus you see a
focus in every .NET release on removing as much overhead as possible from such scenarios, while also
finding ways to further optimize the concrete operations developers are commonly performing.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some new APIs that can help make writing more efficient code easier. When examining
string parsing/processing code, it’s very common to see characters examined for their inclusion in
various sets. For example, you might see a loop looking for characters that are ASCII digits:</p>
<p>while (i &lt; str.Length)
{
if (str[i] &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; str[i] &lt;= '9')
{
i++;
}
}</p>
<p>or that are ASCII letters:</p>
<p>while (i &lt; str.Length)
{
if ((str[i] &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; str[i] &lt;= 'z') || (str[i] &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; str[i] &lt;= 'Z'))
{
i++;
}
}</p>
<p>or other such groups. Interestingly, there’s wide-spread variation in how such checks are coded, often
depending on how much effort a developer put in to optimizing them, or in some cases likely not
even recognizing that some amount of performance was being left on the table. For example, that
same ASCII letter check could instead be written as:</p>
<p>while (i &lt; str.Length)
{
if ((uint)((c | 0x20) - 'a') &lt;= 'z' - 'a')
{
i++;
}
}</p>
<p>which while more “intense” is also much more concise and more efficient. It’s taking advantage of a
few tricks. First, rather than having two comparisons to determine whether the character is greater
than or equal to the lower bound and less than or equal to the upper bound, it’s doing a single
comparison based on the distance between the character and the lower bound ((uint)(c - 'a')). If
'c' is beyond 'z', then 'c' - 'a' will be larger than 25, and the comparison will fail. If 'c' is earlier</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>than 'a', then 'c' - 'a' will be negative, and casting it to uint will then cause it to wrap around to a
massive number, also larger than 25, again causing the comparison to fail. Thus, we’re able to pay a
single additional subtraction to avoid an entire additional comparison and branch, which is almost
always a good deal. The second trick is that | 0x20. The ASCII table has some well-thought-out
relationships, including that upper-case 'A' and lower-case 'a' differ by only a single bit ('A' is
0b1000001 and 'a' is 0b1100001). To go from any lowercase ASCII letter to its uppercase ASCII
equivalent, we thus need only to &amp; ~0x20 (to turn off that bit), and to go in the opposite direction
from any uppercase ASCII letter to its lowercase ASCII equivalent, we need only to | 0x20 (to turn on
that bit). We can take advantage of this in our range check, then, by normalizing our char c to be
lowercase, such that for the low cost of a bit twiddle, we can achieve both the lowercase and
uppercase range checks. Of course, those tricks aren’t something we want every developer to have to
know and write on each use. Instead, .NET 7 exposes a bunch of new helpers on System.Char to
encapsulate these common checks, done in an efficient manner. char already had methods like
IsDigit and IsLetter, which provided the more comprehensive Unicode meaning of those monikers
(e.g. there are ~320 Unicode characters categorized as “digits”). Now in .NET 7, there are also these
helpers:</p>

<p>IsAsciiLetterOrDigit</p>
<p>These methods were added by dotnet/runtime#69318, which also employed them in dozens of
locations where such checks were being performed across dotnet/runtime (many of them using less-
efficient approaches).</p>
<p>Another new API focused on encapsulating a common pattern is the new
MemoryExtensions.CommonPrefixLength method, introduced by dotnet/runtime#67929. This accepts
either two ReadOnlySpan<T> instances or a Span<T> and a ReadOnlySpan<T>, and an optional
IEqualityComparer<T>, and returns the number of elements that are the same at the beginning of
each input span. This is useful when you want to know the first place that two inputs differ.
dotnet/runtime#68210 from <a href="https://github.com/gfoidl">@gfoidl</a> then utilized the new Vector128
functionality to provide a basic vectorization of the implementation. As it’s comparing two sequences
and looking for the first place they differ, this implementation uses a neat trick, which is to have a
single method implemented to compare the sequences as bytes. If the T being compared is bitwise-
equatable and no custom equality comparer is supplied, then it reinterpret-casts the refs from the
spans as byte refs, and uses the single shared implementation.</p>
<p>Yet another new set of APIs are the IndexOfAnyExcept and LastIndexOfAnyExcept methods,
introduced by dotnet/runtime#67941 and used in a variety of additional call sites by
dotnet/runtime#71146 and dotnet/runtime#71278. While somewhat of a mouthful, these methods
are quite handy. They do what their name suggests: whereas IndexOf(T value) searches for the first</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>occurrence of value in the input, and whereas IndexOfAny(T value0, T value1, ...) searches for
the first occurrence of any of value0, value1, etc. in the input, IndexOfAnyExcept(T value) searches
for the first occurrence of something that’s not equal to value, and similarly IndexOfAnyExcept(T
value0, T value1, ...) searches for the first occurrence of something that’s not equal to value0,
value1, etc. For example, let’s say you wanted to know whether an array of integers was entirely 0.
You can now write that as:</p>
<p>bool allZero = array.AsSpan().IndexOfAnyExcept(0) &lt; 0;</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#73488 vectorizes this overload, as well.</p>

<p>Of course, while new “index of” variations are helpful, we already have a bunch of such methods, and
it’s important that they are as efficient as possible. These core IndexOf{Any} methods are used in
huge numbers of places, many of which are performance-sensitive, and so every release they get
additional tender-loving care. While PRs like dotnet/runtime#67811 got gains by paying very close
attention to the assembly code being generated (in this case, tweaking some of the checks used on
Arm64 in IndexOf and IndexOfAny to achieve better utilization), the biggest improvements here come
in places where either vectorization was added and none was previously employed, or where the
vectorization scheme was overhauled for significant gain. Let’s start with dotnet/runtime#63285,
which yields huge improvements for many uses of IndexOf and LastIndexOf for “substrings” of bytes
and chars. Previously, given a call like str.IndexOf(&quot;hello&quot;), the implementation would essentially
do the equivalent of repeatedly searching for the ‘h’, and when an ‘h’ was found, then performing a
SequenceEqual to match the remainder. As you can imagine, however, it’s very easy to run into cases
where the first character being searched for is very common, such that you frequently have to break
out of the vectorized loop in order to do the full string comparison. Instead, the PR implements an
algorithm based on SIMD-friendly algorithms for substring searching. Rather than just searching for
the first character, it can instead vectorize a search for both the first and last character at appropriate
distances from each other. In our “hello” example, in any given input, it’s much more likely to find an</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>‘h’ than it is to find an ‘h’ followed four characters later by an ‘o’, and thus this implementation is able
to stay within the vectorized loop a lot longer, garnering many fewer false positives that force it down
the SequenceEqual route. The implementation also handles cases where the two characters selected
are equal, in which case it’ll quickly look for another character that’s not equal in order to maximize
the efficiency of the search. We can see the impact of all of this with a couple of examples:</p>

<p>This is pulling down the text to “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes” from Project Gutenberg and
then benchmarking using IndexOf to count the occurrences of “Sherlock” and “elementary” in the
text. On my machine, I get results like this:</p>

<p>For “Sherlock”, the performance is actually a bit worse in .NET 7 than in .NET 6; not much, but a
measurable 10%. That’s because there are very few capital 'S' characters in the source text, 841 to be
exact, out of 593,836 characters in the document. At only 0.1% density of the starting character, the
new algorithm doesn’t bring much benefit, as the existing algorithm that searched for the first
character alone captures pretty much all of the possible vectorization gains to be had, and we do pay
a bit of overhead in doing a search for both the 'S' and the 'k', whereas previously we’d have only
searched for the 'S'. In contrast, though, there are 54,614 'e' characters in the document, so almost
10% of the source. In that case, .NET 7 is 20x faster than .NET 6, taking 53us on .NET 7 to count all the
'e'’s vs 1084us on .NET 6. In this case, the new scheme yields immense gains, by vectorizing a search
for both the 'e' and a 'y' at the specific distance away, a combination that is much, much less
frequent. This is one of those situations where overall there are on average huge observed gains even
though we can see small regressions for some specific inputs.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>Another example of significantly changing the algorithm employed is dotnet/runtime#67758, which
enables some amount of vectorization to be applied to IndexOf(&quot;...&quot;,
StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase). Previously, this operation was implemented with a fairly
typical substring search, walking the input string and at every location doing an inner loop to
compare the target string, except performing a ToUpper on every character in order to do it in a case-
insensitive manner. Now with this PR, which is based on approaches previously used by Regex, if the
target string begins with an ASCII character, the implementation can use IndexOf (if the character isn’t
an ASCII letter) or IndexOfAny (if the character is an ASCII letter) to quickly jump ahead to the first
possible location of a match. Let’s take the exact same benchmark as we just looked at, but tweaked
to use OrdinalIgnoreCase:</p>
<p>private static readonly string s_haystack = new
HttpClient().GetStringAsync(&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-0.txt&quot;).Result;</p>

{
haystack = haystack.Slice(pos + needle.Length);
count++;
}</p>
<pre><code>return count;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>Here, both words are about 4x faster on .NET 7 than they were on .NET 6:</p>

manually walking each character and comparing it. (dotnet/runtime#73533 uses the same approach
now for handling IndexOf(char, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase).)</p>
<p>Another example comes from dotnet/runtime#67492 from <a href="https://github.com/gfoidl">@gfoidl</a>. It
updates MemoryExtensions.Contains with the approach we discussed earlier for handling the
leftover elements at the end of vectorized operation: process one last vector’s worth of data, even if it
means duplicating some work already done. This particularly helps for smaller inputs where the
processing time might otherwise be dominated by the serial handling of those leftovers.</p>

impact of IndexOf. Prior to this PR, IndexOf was vectorized for one and two-byte sized primitive
types, but this PR extends it as well to four and eight-byte sized primitives. As with most of the other
vectorized implementations, it checks whether the T is bitwise-equatable, which is important for the
vectorization as it’s only looking at the bits in memory and not paying attention to any Equals
implementation that might be defined on the type. In practice today, that means this is limited to just
a handful of types of which the runtime has intimate knowledge (Boolean, Byte, SByte, UInt16, Int16,
Char, UInt32, Int32, UInt64, Int64, UIntPtr, IntPtr, Rune, and enums), but in theory it could be
extended in the future.</p>

<p>One final interesting IndexOf-related optimization. string has long had
IndexOf/IndexOfAny/LastIndexOf/LastIndexOfAny, and obviously for string it’s all about
processing chars. When ReadOnlySpan<T> and Span<T> came on the scene, MemoryExtensions was
added to provide extension methods for spans and friends, including such
IndexOf/IndexOfAny/LastIndexOf/LastIndexOfAny methods. But for spans, this is about more than
just char, and so MemoryExtensions grew its own set of implementations largely separate from
string’s. Over the years, MemoryExtensions implementations have specialized more and more types,
but in particular byte and char, such that over time string’s implementations have mostly been
replaced by delegation into the same implementation as MemoryExtensions uses. However,
IndexOfAny and LastIndexOfAny had been unification holdouts, each in its own direction.
string.IndexOfAny did delegate to the same implementation as MemoryExtensions.IndexOfAny for
1-5 values being searched for, but for more than 5 values, string.IndexOfAny used a “probabilistic
map,” essentially a Bloom filter. It creates a 256-bit table, and quickly sets bits in that table based on
the values being searched for (essentially hashing them, but with a trivial hash function). Then it
iterates through the input, and rather than checking every input character against every one of the
target values, it instead first looks up the input character in the table. If the corresponding bit isn’t set,
it knows the input character doesn’t match any of the target values. If the corresponding bit is set,
then it proceeds to compare the input character against each of the target values, with a high
probability of it being one of them. MemoryExtensions.IndexOfAny lacked such a filter for more than
5 values. Conversely, string.LastIndexOfAny didn’t provide any vectorization for multiple target
values, whereas MemoryExtensions.LastIndexOfAny vectorized two and three target values. As of</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#63817, all of these are now unified, such that both string and MemoryExtensions
get the best of what the other had.</p>

<p>That same PR also cleans up uses of the IndexOf family, and in particular around uses that are
checking for containment rather than the actual index of a result. The IndexOf family of methods
return a non-negative value when an element is found, and otherwise return -1. That means when
checking whether an element was found, code can use either &gt;= 0 or != -1, and when checking
whether an element wasn’t found, code can use either &lt; 0 or == -1. It turns out that the code
generated for comparisons against 0 is ever so slightly more efficient than comparisons generated
against -1, and this isn’t something the JIT can itself substitute without the IndexOf methods being
intrinsics such that the JIT can understand the semantics of the return value. Thus, for consistency and
a small perf gain, all relevant call sites were switched to compare against 0 instead of against -1.</p>

<p>Speaking of call sites, one of the great things about having highly optimized IndexOf methods is
using them in all the places that can benefit, removing the maintenance impact of open-coded
replacements while also reaping the perf wins. dotnet/runtime#63913 used IndexOf inside of

substantial throughput gains even with the allocation and copy that is inherent to the method’s
design:</p>

<p>And dotnet/runtime#70176 cleaned up a plethora of additional uses.</p>
<p>Finally on the IndexOf front, as noted, a lot of time and energy over the years has gone into
optimizing these methods. In previous releases, some of that energy has been in the form of using
hardware intrinsics directly, e.g. having an SSE2 code path and an AVX2 code path and an AdvSimd
code path. Now that we have Vector128<T> and Vector256<T>, many such uses can be simplified
(e.g. avoiding the duplication between an SSE2 implementation and an AdvSimd implementation)
while still maintaining as good or even better performance and while automatically supporting
vectorization on other platforms with their own intrinsics, like WebAssembly. dotnet/runtime#73481,
dotnet/runtime#73556, dotnet/runtime#73368, dotnet/runtime#73364, dotnet/runtime#73064, and
dotnet/runtime#73469 all contributed here, in some cases incurring meaningful throughput gains:</p>

<p>The IndexOf family is just one of many on string/MemoryExtensions that has seen dramatic
improvements. Another are the SequenceEquals family, including Equals, StartsWith, and EndsWith.
One of my favorite changes in the whole release is dotnet/runtime#65288 and is squarely in this area.
It’s very common to see calls to methods like StartsWith with a constant string argument, e.g.
value.StartsWith(&quot;https://&quot;), value.SequenceEquals(&quot;Key&quot;), etc. These methods are now
recognized by the JIT, which can now automatically unroll the comparison and compare more than
one char at a time, e.g. doing a single read of four chars as a long and a single comparison of that
long against the expected combination of those four chars. The result is beautiful. Making it even
better is dotnet/runtime#66095, which adds to this support for OrdinalIgnoreCase. Remember those
ASCII bit twiddling tricks discussed a bit earlier with char.IsAsciiLetter and friends? The JIT now
employs the same trick as part of this unrolling, so if you do that same
value.StartsWith(&quot;https://&quot;) but instead as value.StartsWith(&quot;https://&quot;,
StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase), it will recognize that the whole comparison string is ASCII
and will OR in the appropriate mask on both the comparison constant and on the read data from the
input in order to perform the comparison in a case-insensitive manner.</p>

<p>Interestingly, since .NET 5 the code generated by RegexOptions.Compiled would perform similar
unrolling when comparing sequences of multiple characters, and when the source generator was
added in .NET 7, it also learned how to do this. However, the source generator has problems with such
an optimization, due to endianness. The constants being compared against are subject to byte
ordering issues, such that the source generator would need to emit code that could handle running
on either little-endian or big-endian machines. The JIT has no such problem, as it’s generating the
code on the same machine on which the code will execute (and in scenarios where it’s being used to
generate code ahead of time, the entirety of that code is already tied to a particular architecture). By
moving this optimization into the JIT, the corresponding code could be deleted from
RegexOptions.Compiled and the regex source generator, which then also benefits from producing</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>much easier to read code utilizing StartsWith that’s just as fast (dotnet/runtime#65222 and
dotnet/runtime#66339). Wins all around. (This could only be removed from RegexOptions.Compiled
after dotnet/runtime#68055, which fixed the ability for the JIT to recognize these string literals in
DynamicMethods, which RegexOptions.Compiled uses with reflection emit to spit out the IL for the
regex being compiled.)</p>
<p>StartsWith and EndsWith have improved in other ways. dotnet/runtime#63734 (improved further by
dotnet/runtime#64530) added another really interesting JIT-based optimization, but to understand it,
we need to understand string’s internal layout. string is essentially represented in memory as an
int length followed by that many chars plus a null terminator char. The actual System.String class
represents this in C# as an int _stringLength field followed by a char _firstChar field, such that
_firstChar indeed lines up with the first character of the string, or the null terminator if the string is
empty. Internally in System.Private.CoreLib, and in particular in methods on string itself, code will
often refer to _firstChar directly when the first character needs to be consulted, as it’s typically faster
to do that than to use str[0], in particular because there are no bounds checks involved and the
string’s length generally needn’t be consulted. Now, consider a method like public bool
StartsWith(char value) on string. In .NET 6, the implementation was:</p>
<p>return Length != 0 &amp;&amp; _firstChar == value;</p>
<p>which given what I just described makes sense: if the Length is 0, then the string doesn’t begin with
the specified character, and if Length is not 0, then we can just compare the value against
_firstChar. But, why is that Length check even needed at all? Couldn’t we just do return
_firstChar == value;? That will avoid the additional comparison and branch, and it will work just
fine… unless the target character is itself '\0', in which case we could get false positives on the result.
Now to this PR. The PR introduces an internal JIT intrinsinc RuntimeHelpers.IsKnownConstant, which
the JIT will substitute with true if the containing method is inlined and the argument passed to
IsKnownConstant is then seen to be a constant. In such cases, the implementation can rely on other
JIT optimizations kicking in and optimizing various code in the method, effectively enabling a
developer to write two different implementations, one when the argument is known to be a constant
and one when not. With that in hand, the PR is able to optimize StartsWith as follows:</p>
<p>public bool StartsWith(char value)
{
if (RuntimeHelpers.IsKnownConstant(value) &amp;&amp; value != '\0')
return _firstChar == value;</p>
<pre><code>return Length != 0 &amp;&amp; _firstChar == value;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>If the value parameter isn’t a constant, then IsKnownConstant will be substituted with false, the
entire starting if block will be eliminated, and the method will be left exactly was it was before. But, if
this method gets inlined and the value was actually a constant, then the value != '\0' condition will
also be evaluatable at JIT-compile-time. If the value is in fact '\0', well, again that whole if block will
be eliminated and we’re no worse off. But in the common case where the value isn’t null, the entire
method will end up being compiled as if it were:</p>
<p>return _firstChar == ConstantValue;</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>and we’ve saved ourselves a read of the string’s length, a comparison, and a branch.
dotnet/runtime#69038 then employs a similar technique for EndsWith.</p>

<p>(Another example of IsKnownConstant being used comes from dotnet/runtime#64016, which uses it
to improve Math.Round when a MidpointRounding mode is specified. Call sites to this almost always
explicitly specify the enum value as a constant, which then allows the JIT to specialize the code

<p>String.Split also saw vectorization improvements in dotnet/runtime#64899 from
<a href="https://github.com/yesmey">@yesmey</a>. As with some of the previously discussed PRs, it switched the
existing usage of SSE2 and SSSE3 hardware intrinsics over to the new Vector128<T> helpers, which
improved upon the existing implementation while also implicitly adding vectorization support for
Arm64.</p>
<p>Converting various formats of strings is something many applications and services do, whether that’s
converting from UTF8 bytes to and from string or formatting and parsing hex values. Such
operations have also improved in a variety of ways in .NET 7. Base64-encoding, for example, is a way
of representing arbitrary binary data (think byte[]) across mediums that only support text, encoding
bytes into one of 64 different ASCII characters. Multiple APIs in .NET implement this encoding. For
converting between binary data represented as ReadOnlySpan<byte> and UTF8 (actually ASCII)
encoded data also represented as ReadOnlySpan<byte>, the System.Buffers.Text.Base64 type
provides EncodeToUtf8 and DecodeFromUtf8 methods. These were vectorized several releases ago,
but they were further improved in .NET 7 via dotnet/runtime#70654 from
<a href="https://github.com/a74nh">@a74nh</a>, which converted the SSSE3-based implementation to use
Vector128<T> (which in turn implicitly enabled vectorization on Arm64). However, for converting
between arbitrary binary data represented as ReadOnlySpan<byte>/byte[] and
ReadOnlySpan<char>/char[]/string, the System.Convert type exposes multiple methods, e.g.
Convert.ToBase64String, and these methods historically were not vectorized. That changes in .NET
7, where dotnet/runtime#71795 and dotnet/runtime#73320 vectorize the ToBase64String,
ToBase64CharArray, and TryToBase64Chars methods. The way they do this is interesting. Rather than
effectively duplicating the vectorization implementation from Base64.EncodeToUtf8, they instead
layer on top of EncodeToUtf8, calling it to encode the input byte data into an output Span<byte>.
Then, then they “widen” those bytes into chars (remember, Base64-encoded data is a set of ASCII
chars, so going from these bytes to chars entails adding just a 0 byte onto each element). That
widening can itself easily be done in a vectorized manner. The other interesting thing about this
layering is it doesn’t actually require separate intermediate storage for the encoded bytes. The
implementation can perfectly compute the number of resulting characters for encoding X bytes into Y</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>Base64 characters (there’s a formula), and the implementation can either allocate that final space
(e.g. in the case of ToBase64CharArray) or ensure the provided space is sufficient (e.g. in the case of
TryToBase64Chars). And since we know the initial encoding will require exactly half as many bytes, we
can encode into that same space (with the destination span reinterpreted as a byte span rather than
char span), and then widen “in place”: walk from the end of the bytes and the end of the char space,
copying the bytes into the destination.</p>

<p>Just as widening can be used to go from bytes to chars, narrowing can be used to go from chars to
bytes, in particular if the chars are actually ASCII and thus have a 0 upper byte. Such narrowing can be
vectorized, and the internal NarrowUtf16ToAscii utility helper does exactly that, used as part of
methods like Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes. While this method was previously vectorized, its primary
fast-path utilized SSE2 and thus didn’t apply to Arm64; thanks to dotnet/runtime#70080 from
<a href="https://github.com/SwapnilGaikwad">@SwapnilGaikwad</a>, that path was changed over to be based on
the cross-platform Vector128<T>, enabling the same level of optimization across supported
platforms. Similarly, dotnet/runtime#71637 from
<a href="https://github.com/SwapnilGaikwad">@SwapnilGaikwad</a> adds Arm64 vectorization to the
GetIndexOfFirstNonAsciiChar internal helper that’s used by methods like
Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCount. (And in the same vein, dotnet/runtime#67192 changed the internal
HexConverter.EncodeToUtf16 method from using SSSE3 intrinsics to instead use Vector128<T>,
automatically providing an Arm64 implementation.)</p>
<p>Encoding.UTF8 was also improved a bit. In particular, dotnet/runtime#69910 streamlined the
implementations of GetMaxByteCount and GetMaxCharCount, making them small enough to be
commonly inlined when used directly off of Encoding.UTF8 such that the JIT is able to devirtualize the
calls.</p>

<p>Arguably the biggest improvement around UTF8 in .NET 7 is the new C# 11 support for UTF8 literals.
Initially implemented in the C# compiler in dotnet/roslyn#58991, with follow-on work in
dotnet/roslyn#59390, dotnet/roslyn#61532, and dotnet/roslyn#62044, UTF8 literals enables the
compiler to perform the UTF8 encoding into bytes at compile-time. Rather than writing a normal
string, e.g. &quot;hello&quot;, a developer simply appends the new u8 suffix onto the string literal, e.g.
&quot;hello&quot;u8. At that point, this is no longer a string. Rather, the natural type of this expression is a
ReadOnlySpan<byte>. If you write:</p>
<p>public static ReadOnlySpan<byte> Text =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;u8;</p>
<p>the C# compiler will compile that equivalent to if you wrote:</p>
<p>public static ReadOnlySpan<byte> Text =&gt;
new ReadOnlySpan<byte>(new byte[] { (byte)'h', (byte)'e', (byte)'l', (byte)'l',
(byte)'o', (byte)'\0' }, 0, 5);</p>
<p>In other words, the compiler is doing the equivalent of Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes at compile-time and
hardcoding the resulting bytes, saving the cost of performing that encoding at run-time. Of course, at
first glance, that array allocation might look terribly inefficient. However, looks can be deceiving, and
are in this case. For several releases now, when the C# compiler sees a byte[] (or sbyte[] or bool[])
being initialized with a constant length and constant values and immediately cast to or used to
construct a ReadOnlySpan<byte>, it optimizes away the byte[] allocation. Instead, it blits the data for
that span into the assembly’s data section, and then constructs a span that points directly to that data
in the loaded assembly. This is the actual generated IL for the above property:</p>
<p>IL_0000: ldsflda valuetype '<PrivateImplementationDetails>'/'__StaticArrayInitTypeSize=6'
'<PrivateImplementationDetails>'::F3AEFE62965A91903610F0E23CC8A69D5B87CEA6D28E75489B0D2CA02
ED7993C
IL_0005: ldc.i4.5
IL_0006: newobj instance void valuetype
[System.Runtime]System.ReadOnlySpan`1<uint8>::.ctor(void*, int32)
IL_000b: ret</p>
<p>This means we not only save on the encoding costs at run-time, and we not only avoid whatever
managed allocations might be required to store the resulting data, we also benefit from the JIT being
able to see information about the encoded data, like it’s length, enabling knock-on optimizations. You
can see this clearly by examining the assembly generated for a method like:</p>
<p>public static int M() =&gt; Text.Length;</p>
<p>for which the JIT produces:</p>
<p>; Program.M()
mov       eax,5</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>ret
; Total bytes of code 6</p>
<p>The JIT inlines the property access, sees that the span is being constructed with a length of 5, and so
rather than emitting any array allocations or span constructions or anything even resembling that, it
simply outputs mov eax, 5 to return the known length of the span.</p>
<p>Thanks primarily to dotnet/runtime#70568, dotnet/runtime#69995, dotnet/runtime#70894,
dotnet/runtime#71417 from <a href="https://github.com/am11">@am11</a>, dotnet/runtime#71292,
dotnet/runtime#70513, and dotnet/runtime#71992, u8 is now used more than 2100 times throughout
dotnet/runtime. Hardly a fair comparison, but the following benchmark demonstrates how little work
is actually being performed for u8 at execution time:</p>

<p>Like I said, not fair, but it proves the point :)</p>
<p>Encoding is of course just one mechanism for creating string instances. Others have also improved in
.NET 7. Take the super common long.ToString, for example. Previous releases improved
int.ToString, but there were enough differences between the 32-bit and 64-bit algorithms that long
didn’t see all of the same gains. Now thanks to dotnet/runtime#68795, the 64-bit formatting code
paths are made much more similar to the 32-bit, resulting in faster performance.</p>
<p>You can also see improvements in string.Format and StringBuilder.AppendFormat, as well as
other helpers that layer on top of these (like TextWriter.AppendFormat). dotnet/runtime#69757
overhauls the core routines inside Format to avoid unnecessary bounds checking, favor expected
cases, and generally clean up the implementation. It also, however, utilities IndexOfAny to search for
the next interpolation hole that needs to be filled in, and if the non-hole-character to hole ratio is high
(e.g. long format string with few holes), it can be way faster than before.</p>

<p>0.15</p>
<p>Speaking of StringBuilder, it’s seen additional improvements beyond the aforementioned changes
to AppendFormat. One interesting change is dotnet/runtime#64405, which achieved two related
things. The first was to remove pinning as part of formatting operations. As an example,
StringBuilder has an Append(char* value, int valueCount) overload which copies the specified
number of characters from the specified pointer into the StringBuilder, and other APIs were
implemented in terms of this method; for example, the Append(string? value, int startIndex,
int count) method was essentially implemented as:</p>
<p>fixed (char* ptr = value)
{
Append(ptr + startIndex, count);
}</p>
<p>That fixed statement translates into a “pinning pointer.” Normally the GC is free to move managed
objects around on the heap, which it might do in order to compact the heap (to, for example, avoid
small, unusuable fragments of memory between objects). But if the GC can move objects around, a
normal native pointer into that memory would be terribly unsafe and unreliable, as without notice the
data being pointed to could move and your pointer could now be pointing to garbage or to some
other object that was shifted to this location. There are two ways for dealing with this. The first is a
“managed pointer,” otherwise known as a “reference” or “ref,” as that’s exactly what you get when you
have the “ref” keyword in C#; it’s a pointer that the runtime will update with the correct value when it
moves the object being pointed into. The second is to prevent the pointed-to object from being
moved, “pinning” it in place. And that’s what the “fixed” keyword does, pinning the referenced object
for the duration of the fixed block, during which time it’s safe to use the supplied pointer. Thankfully,
pinning is cheap when no GC occurs; when a GC does occur, however, pinned objects aren’t able to be
moved around, and thus pinning can have a global impact on the performance of the application (and
on GCs themselves). There are also various optimizations inhibited by pinning. With all of the advents
in C# around being able to use ref in many more places (e.g. ref locals, ref returns, and now in C# 11,
ref fields), and with all of the new APIs in .NET for manipulating refs (e.g. Unsafe.Add,
Unsafe.AreSame), it’s now possible to rewrite code that was using pinning pointers to instead use
managed pointers, thereby avoiding the problems that come from pinning. Which is what this PR did.
Rather than implementing all of the Append methods in terms of an Append(char*, int) helper,
they’re now all implemented in terms of an Append(ref char, int) helper. So for example instead of
the previously shown Append(string? value, int startIndex, int count) implementation, it’s
now akin to</p>
<p>Append(ref Unsafe.Add(ref value.GetRawStringData(), startIndex), count);</p>
<p>where that string.GetRawStringData method is just an internal version of the public
string.GetPinnableReference method, returning a ref instead of a ref readonly. This means that
all of the high-performance code inside of StringBuilder that had been using pointers to avoid
bounds checking and the like can continue to do so, but now also does so without pinning all of the
inputs.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>The second thing this StringBuilder change did was unify an optimization that was present for
string inputs to also apply to char[] inputs and ReadOnlySpan<char> inputs. Specifically, because
it’s so common to append string instances to a StringBuilder, a special code path was long ago
put in place to optimize for this input and specifically for the case where there’s already enough room
in the StringBuilder to hold the whole input, at which point an efficient copy can be used. With a
shared Append(ref char, int) helper, though, this optimization can be moved down into that
helper, such that it not only helps out string but any other type that also calls into the same helper.
The effects of this are visible in a simple microbenchmark:</p>
<p>private StringBuilder _sb = new StringBuilder();</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public void AppendSpan()
{
_sb.Clear();
_sb.Append(&quot;this&quot;.AsSpan());
_sb.Append(&quot;is&quot;.AsSpan());
_sb.Append(&quot;a&quot;.AsSpan());
_sb.Append(&quot;test&quot;.AsSpan());
_sb.Append(&quot;.&quot;.AsSpan());

<p>One of the great things about improving things low in the stack is they have a multiplicative effect;
they not only help improve the performance of user code that directly relies on the improved
functionality, they can also help improve the performance of other code in the core libraries, which
then further helps dependent apps and services. You can see this, for example, with
DateTimeOffset.ToString, which depends on StringBuilder:</p>
<p>private DateTimeOffset _dto = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;</p>

<p>StringBuilder itself was then further updated by dotnet/runtime#64922 from <a href="https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis">@teo-
tsirpanis</a>, which improves the Insert methods. It used to be that
the Append(primitive) methods on StringBuilder (e.g. Append(int)) would call ToString on the
value and then append the resulting string. With the advent of ISpanFormattable, as a fast-path
those methods now try to format the value directly into the StringBuilder’s internal buffer, and only
if there’s not enough room remaining do they then take the old path as a fallback. Insert wasn’t
improved in this way at the time, because it can’t just format into the space at the end of the builder;
the insert location could be anywhere in the builder. This PR addresses that by formatting into some
temporary stack space, and then delegating to the existing internal ref-based helper from the</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>previously discussed PR to insert the resulting characters at the right location (it also falls back to
ToString when there’s not enough stack space for the ISpanFormattable.TryFormat, but that only
happens in incredibly corner cases, like a floating-point value that formats to hundreds of digits).</p>

<p>Other minor improvements to StringBuilder have also been made, like dotnet/runtime#60406 which
removed a small int[] allocation from the Replace method. Even with all these improvements,
though, the fastest use of StringBuilder is no use; dotnet/runtime#68768 removed a bunch of uses
of StringBuilder that would have been better served with other string-creation mechanisms. For
example, the legacy DataView type had some code that created a sorting specification as a string:</p>
<p>private static string CreateSortString(PropertyDescriptor property, ListSortDirection
direction)
{
var resultString = new StringBuilder();
resultString.Append('[');
resultString.Append(property.Name);
resultString.Append(']');
if (ListSortDirection.Descending == direction)
{
resultString.Append(&quot; DESC&quot;);
}
return resultString.ToString();
}</p>
<p>We don’t actually need the StringBuilder here, as in the worst-case we’re just concatenating three
strings, and string.Concat has a dedicated overload for that exact operation that has the best
possible implementation for that operation (and if we ever found a better way, that method would be
improved according). So we can just use that:</p>
<p>private static string CreateSortString(PropertyDescriptor property, ListSortDirection
direction) =&gt;
direction == ListSortDirection.Descending ?
$&quot;[{property.Name}] DESC&quot; :
$&quot;[{property.Name}]&quot;;</p>
<p>Note that I’ve expressed that concatenation via an interpolated string, but the C# compiler will “lower”
this interpolated string to a call to string.Concat, so the IL for this is indistinguishable from if I’d
instead written:</p>
<p>private static string CreateSortString(PropertyDescriptor property, ListSortDirection
direction) =&gt;</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>direction == ListSortDirection.Descending ?
string.Concat(&quot;[&quot;, property.Name, &quot;] DESC&quot;) :
string.Concat(&quot;[&quot;, property.Name, &quot;]&quot;);</p>
<p>As an aside, the expanded string.Concat version highlights that this method could have been
written to result in a bit less IL if it were instead written as:</p>
<p>private static string CreateSortString(PropertyDescriptor property, ListSortDirection
direction) =&gt;
string.Concat(&quot;[&quot;, property.Name, direction == ListSortDirection.Descending ? &quot;] DESC&quot;
: &quot;]&quot;);</p>
<p>but this doesn’t meaningfully affect performance and here clarity and maintainability was more
important than shaving off a few bytes.</p>

<p>There are also places where StringBuilder was still applicable, but it was being used on hot-enough
paths that previous releases of .NET saw the StringBuilder instance being cached. Several of the
core libraries, including System.Private.CoreLib, have an internal StringBuilderCache type which
caches a StringBuilder instance in a [ThreadStatic], meaning every thread could end up having
such an instance. There are several issues with this, including that the buffers employed by
StringBuilder aren’t usable for anything else while the StringBuilder isn’t in use, and because of
that, StringBuilderCache places a limit on the capacity of the StringBuilder instances that can be
cached; attempts to cache ones longer than that result in them being thrown away. It’d be better
instead to use cached arrays that aren’t length-limited and that everyone has access to for sharing.
Many of the core .NET libraries have an internal ValueStringBuilder type for this purpose, a ref
struct-based type that can use stackalloc’d memory to start and then if necessary grow into
ArrayPool<char> arrays. And with dotnet/runtime#64522 and dotnet/runtime#69683, many of the</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>remaining uses of StringBuilderCache have been replaced. I’m hopeful we can entirely remove
StringBuilderCache in the future.</p>
<p>In the same vein of not doing unnecessary work, there’s a fairly common pattern that shows up with
methods like string.Substring and span.Slice:</p>
<p>span = span.Slice(offset, str.Length - offset);</p>
<p>The relevant thing to recognize here is these methods have overloads that take just the starting offset.
Since the length being specified is the remainder after the specified offset, the call could instead be
simplified to:</p>
<p>span = span.Slice(offset);</p>
<p>which is not only more readable and maintainable, it has some small efficiency benefits, e.g. on 64-bit
the Slice(int, int) constructor has an extra addition over Slice(int), and for 32-bit the
Slice(int, int) constructor incurs an additional comparison and branch. It’s thus beneficial for both
code maintenance and for performance to simplify these calls, which dotnet/runtime#68937 does for
all found occurrences of that pattern. This is then made more impactful by dotnet/runtime#73882,
which streamlines string.Substring to remove unnecessary overheads, e.g. it condenses four
argument validation checks down to a single fast-path comparison (in 64-bit processes).</p>
<p>Ok, enough about string. What about spans? One of the coolest features in C# 11 is the new support
for ref fields. What is a ref field? You’re familiar with refs in C# in general, and we’ve already
discussed how they’re essentially managed pointers, i.e. pointers that the runtime can update at any
time due to the object it references getting moved on the heap. These references can point to the
beginning of an object, or they can point somewhere inside the object, in which case they’re referred
to as “interior pointers.” ref has existed in C# since 1.0, but at that time it was primarily about passing
by reference to method calls, e.g.</p>
<p>class Data
{
public int Value;
}
...
void Add(ref int i)
{
i++;
}
...
var d = new Data { Value = 42 };
Add(ref d.Value);
Debug.Assert(d.Value == 43);</p>
<p>Later versions of C# added the ability to have local refs, e.g.</p>
<p>void Add(ref int i)
{
ref j = ref i;
j++;
}</p>
<p>and even to have ref returns, e.g.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>ref int Add(ref int i)
{
ref j = ref i;
j++;
return ref j;
}</p>
<p>These facilities are more advanced, but they’re used liberally throughout higher-performance code
bases, and many of the optimizations in .NET in recent years are possible in large part due to these
ref-related capabilities.</p>
<p>Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T> themselves are heavily-based on refs. For example, the indexer on
many older collection types is implemented as a get/set property, e.g.</p>
<p>private T[] _items;
...
public T this[int i]
{
get =&gt; _items[i];
set =&gt; _items[i] = value;
}</p>
<p>But not span. Span<T>’s indexer looks more like this:</p>
<p>public ref T this[int index]
{
get
{
if ((uint)index &gt;= (uint)_length)
ThrowHelper.ThrowIndexOutOfRangeException();</p>
<pre><code>    return ref Unsafe.Add(ref _reference, index);
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>Note there’s only a getter and no setter; that’s because it returns a ref T to the actual storage
location. It’s a writable ref, so you can assign to it, e.g. you can write:</p>
<p>span[i] = value;</p>
<p>but rather than that being equivalent to calling some setter:</p>
<p>span.set_Item(i, value);</p>
<p>it’s actually equivalent to using the getter to retrieve the ref and then writing a value through that
ref, e.g.</p>
<p>ref T item = ref span.get_Item(i);
item = value;</p>
<p>That’s all well and good, but what’s that _reference in the getter definition? Well, Span<T> is really
just a tuple of two fields: a reference (to the start of the memory being referred to) and a length (how
many elements from that reference are included in the span). In the past, the runtime had to hack this
with an internal type (ByReference<T>) specially recognized by the runtime to be a reference. But as
of C# 11 and .NET 7, ref structs can now contain ref fields, which means Span<T> today is literally
defined as follows:</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>public readonly ref struct Span<T>
{
internal readonly ref T _reference;
private readonly int _length;
...
}</p>
<p>The rollout of ref fields throughout dotnet/runtime was done in dotnet/runtime#71498, following the
C# language gaining this support primarily in dotnet/roslyn#62155, which itself was the culmination
of many PRs first into a feature branch. ref fields alone doesn’t itself automatically improve
performance, but it does simplify code significantly, and it allows for both new custom code that uses
ref fields as well as new APIs that take advantage of them, both of which can help with performance
(and specifically performance without sacrificing potential safety). One such example of a new API is
new constructors on ReadOnlySpan<T> and Span<T>:</p>
<p>public Span(ref T reference);
public ReadOnlySpan(in T reference);</p>
<p>added in dotnet/runtime#67447 (and then made public and used more broadly in
dotnet/runtime#71589). This may beg the question, why does ref field support enable two new
constructors that take refs, considering spans already were able to store a ref? After all, the
MemoryMarshal.CreateSpan(ref T reference, int length) and corresponding
CreateReadOnlySpan methods have existed for as long as spans have, and these new constructors are
equivalent to calling those methods with a length of 1. The answer is: safety.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could willy-nilly call this constructor. You’d be able to write code like this:</p>
<p>public Span<int> RuhRoh()
{
int i = 42;
return new Span<int>(ref i);
}</p>
<p>At this point the caller of this method is handed a span that refers to garbage; that’s bad in code
that’s intended to be safe. You can already accomplish the same thing by using pointers:</p>
<p>public Span<int> RuhRoh()
{
unsafe
{
int i = 42;
return new Span<int>(&amp;i, 1);
}
}</p>
<p>but at that point you’ve taken on the risk of using unsafe code and pointers and any resulting
problems are on you. With C# 11, if you now try to write the above code using the ref-based
constructor, you’ll be greeted with an error like this:</p>
<p>error CS8347: Cannot use a result of 'Span<int>.Span(ref int)' in this context because it
may expose variables referenced by parameter 'reference' outside of their declaration scope</p>
<p>In other words, the compiler now understands that Span<int> as a ref struct could be storing the
passed in ref, and if it does store it (which Span<T> does), this is akin to passing a ref to a local out</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>of the method, which is bad. Hence how this relates to ref fields: because ref fields are now a thing,
the compiler’s rules for safe-handling of refs have been updated, which in turn enables us to expose
the aforementioned constructors on {ReadOnly}Span<T>.</p>
<p>As is often the case, addressing one issue kicks the can down the road a bit and exposes another. The
compiler now believes that a ref passed to a method on a ref struct could enable that ref struct
instance to store the ref (note that this was already the case with ref structs passed to methods on
ref structs), but what if we don’t want that? What if we want to be able to say “this ref is not
storable and should not escape the calling scope”? From a caller’s perspective, we want the compiler
to allow passing in such refs without it complaining about potential extension of lifetime, and from a
callee’s perspective, we want the compiler to prevent the method from doing what it’s not supposed
to do. Enter scoped. The new C# keyword does exactly what we just wished for: put it on a ref or ref
struct parameter, and the compiler both will guarantee (short of using unsafe code) that the method
can’t stash away the argument and will then enable the caller to write code that relies on that
guarantee. For example, consider this program:</p>
<p>var writer = new SpanWriter(stackalloc char[128]);
Append(ref writer, 123);
writer.Write(&quot;.&quot;);
Append(ref writer, 45);
Console.WriteLine(writer.AsSpan().ToString());</p>
<p>static void Append(ref SpanWriter builder, byte value)
{
Span<char> tmp = stackalloc char[3];
value.TryFormat(tmp, out int charsWritten);
builder.Write(tmp.Slice(0, charsWritten));
}</p>
<p>ref struct SpanWriter
{
private readonly Span<char> _chars;
private int _length;</p>
<pre><code>public SpanWriter(Span&lt;char&gt; destination) =&gt; _chars = destination;

public Span&lt;char&gt; AsSpan() =&gt; _chars.Slice(0, _length);

public void Write(ReadOnlySpan&lt;char&gt; value)
{
    if (_length &gt; _chars.Length - value.Length)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(&quot;Not enough remaining space&quot;);
    }

    value.CopyTo(_chars.Slice(_length));
    _length += value.Length;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>We have a ref struct SpanWriter that takes a Span<char> to its constructor and allows for writing
to it by copying in additional content and then updating the stored length. The Write method accepts
a ReadOnlySpan<char>. And we then have a helper Append method which is formatting a byte into
some stackalloc’d temporary space and passing the resulting formatted chars in to Write.
Straightforward. Except, this doesn’t compile:</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>error CS8350: This combination of arguments to 'SpanWriter.Write(ReadOnlySpan<char>)' is
disallowed because it may expose variables referenced by parameter 'value' outside of their
declaration scope</p>
<p>What do we do? The Write method doesn’t actually store the value parameter and won’t ever need
to, so we can change the signature of the method to annotate it as scoped:</p>
<p>public void Write(scoped ReadOnlySpan<char> value)</p>
<p>If Write were then to try to store value, the compiler would balk:</p>
<p>error CS8352: Cannot use variable 'ReadOnlySpan<char>' in this context because it may
expose referenced variables outside of their declaration scope</p>
<p>But as it’s not trying to do so, everything now compiles successfully. You can see examples of how this
is utilized in the aforementioned dotnet/runtime#71589.</p>
<p>There’s also the other direction: there are some things that are implicitly scoped, like the this
reference on a struct. Consider this code:</p>
<p>public struct SingleItemList
{
private int _value;</p>
<pre><code>public ref int this[int i]
{
    get
    {
        if (i != 0) throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();

        return ref _value;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>This produces a compiler error:</p>
<p>error CS8170: Struct members cannot return 'this' or other instance members by reference</p>
<p>Effectively, that’s because this is implicitly scoped (even though that keyword wasn’t previously
available). What if we want to enable such an item to be returned? Enter [UnscopedRef]. This is rare
enough in need that it doesn’t get its own C# language keyword, but the C# compiler does recognize
the new [UnscopedRef] attribute. It can be put onto relevant parameters but also onto methods and
properties, in which case it applies to the this reference for that member. As such, we can modify our
previous code example to be:</p>
<p>[UnscopedRef]
public ref int this[int i]</p>
<p>and now the code will compile successfully. Of course, this also places demands on callers of this
method. For a call site, the compiler sees the [UnscopedRef] on the member being invoked, and then
knows that the returned ref might reference something from that struct, and thus assigns to the
returned ref the same lifetime as that struct. So, if that struct were a local living on the stack, the ref
would also be limited to that same method.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>Another impactful span-related change comes in dotnet/runtime#70095 from <a href="https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis">@teo-
tsirpanis</a>. System.HashCode’s goal is to provide a fast, easy-to-use
implementation for producing high-quality hash codes. In its current incarnation, it incorporates a
random process-wide seed and is an implementation of the xxHash32 non-cryptographic hash
algorithm. In a previous release, HashCode saw the addition of an AddBytes methods, which accepts a
ReadOnlySpan<byte> and is useful for incorporating sequences of data that should be part of a type’s
hash code, e.g. BigInteger.GetHashCode includes all the data that makes up the BigInteger. The
xxHash32 algorithm works by accumulating 4 32-bit unsigned integers and then combining them
together into the hash code; thus if you call HashCode.Add(int), the first three times you call it you’re
just storing the values separately into the instance, and then the fourth time you call it all of those
values are combined into the hash code (and there’s a separate process that incorporates any
remaining values if the number of 32-bit values added wasn’t an exact multiple of 4). Thus, previously
AddBytes was simply implemented to repeatedly read the next 4 bytes from the input span and call
Add(int) with those bytes as an integer. But those Add calls have overhead. Instead, this PR skips the
Add calls and directly handles the accumulation and combining of the 16 bytes. Interestingly, it still has
to deal with the possibility that previous calls to Add may have left some state queued, which means
(with the current implementation at least), if there are multiple pieces of state to include in the hash
code, say a ReadOnlySpan<byte> and an additional int, it’s more efficient to add the span first and
then the int rather than the other way around. So for example when dotnet/runtime#71274 from
<a href="https://github.com/huoyaoyuan">@huoyaoyuan</a> changed BigInteger.GetHashCode to use
HashCode.AddBytes, it coded the method to first call AddBytes with the BigInteger’s _bits and then
call Add with the _sign.</p>
<p>private byte[] _data = Enumerable.Range(0, 256).Select(i =&gt; (byte)i).ToArray();</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public int AddBytes()
{
HashCode hc = default;
hc.AddBytes(_data);
return hc.ToHashCode();
}</p>

<p>0.26</p>
<p>Another span-related change, dotnet/runtime#72727 refactored a bunch of code paths to eliminate
some cached arrays. Why avoid cached arrays? After all, isn’t it desirable to cache an array once and
reuse it over and over again? It is, if that’s the best option, but sometimes there are better options. For
example, one of the changes took code like:</p>
<p>private static readonly char[] s_pathDelims = { ':', '\', '/', '?', '#' };
...
int index = value.IndexOfAny(s_pathDelims);</p>
<p>and replaced it with code like:</p>
<p>int index = value.AsSpan().IndexOfAny(@&quot;:/?#&quot;);</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>This has a variety of benefits. There’s the usability benefit of keeping the tokens being searched close
to the use site, and the usability benefit of the list being immutable such that some code somewhere
won’t accidentally replace a value in the array. But there are also performance benefits. We don’t need
an extra field to store the array. We don’t need to allocate the array as part of this type’s static
constructor. And loading/using the string is slightly faster.</p>
<p>private static readonly char[] s_pathDelims = { ':', '\', '/', '?', '#' };
private static readonly string s_value = &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;;</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public int WithArray() =&gt; s_value.IndexOfAny(s_pathDelims);</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public int WithString() =&gt; s_value.AsSpan().IndexOfAny(@&quot;:/?#&quot;);</p>

<p>WithArray</p>
<p>8.601 ns</p>
<p>1.00</p>
<p>WithString  6.949 ns</p>
<p>0.81</p>
<p>Another example from that PR took code along the lines of:</p>
<p>private static readonly char[] s_whitespaces = new char[] { ' ', '\t', '\n', '\r' };
...
switch (attr.Value.Trim(s_whitespaces))
{
case &quot;preserve&quot;: return Preserve;
case &quot;default&quot;: return Default;
}</p>
<p>and replaced it with code like:</p>
<p>switch (attr.Value.AsSpan().Trim(&quot; \t\n\r&quot;))
{
case &quot;preserve&quot;: return Preserve;
case &quot;default&quot;: return Default;
}</p>
<p>In this case, not only have we avoided the char[], but if the text did require any trimming of
whitespaces, the new version (which trims a span instead of the original string) will save an allocation
for the trimmed string. This is taking advantage of the new C# 11 feature that supports switching on
ReadOnlySpan<char>s just as you can switch on strings, added in dotnet/roslyn#44388 from
<a href="https://github.com/YairHalberstadt">@YairHalberstadt</a>. dotnet/runtime#68831 also took advantage
of this in several additional places.</p>
<p>Of course, in some cases the arrays are entirely unnecessary. In that same PR, there were several cases
like this:</p>
<p>private static readonly char[] WhiteSpaceChecks = new char[] { ' ', '\u00A0' };
...
int wsIndex = target.IndexOfAny(WhiteSpaceChecks, targetPosition);
if (wsIndex &lt; 0)
{
return false;
}</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>By switching to use spans, again, we can instead write it like this:</p>
<p>int wsIndex = target.AsSpan(targetPosition).IndexOfAny(' ', '\u00A0');
if (wsIndex &lt; 0)
{
return false;
}
wsIndex += targetPosition;</p>
<p>MemoryExtensions.IndexOfAny has a dedicated overload for two and three arguments, at which
point we don’t need the array at all (these overloads also happen to be faster; when passing an array
of two chars, the implementation would extract the two chars from the array and pass them off to the
same two-argument implementation). Multiple other PRs similarly removed array allocations.
dotnet/runtime#60409 removed a single-char array that was cached to be able to pass it to
string.Split and replaced it with usage of the Split overload that directly accepts a single char.</p>
<p>Finally, dotnet/runtime#59670 from <a href="https://github.com/NewellClark">@NewellClark</a> got rid of even
more arrays. We saw earlier how the C# compiler special-cases byte[]s constructed with a constant
length and constant elements and that’s immediately cast to a ReadOnlySpan<byte>. Thus, it can be
beneficial any time there’s such a byte[] being cached to instead expose it as a ReadOnlySpan<byte>.
As I discussed in the .NET 6 post, this avoids even the one-time array allocation you’d get for a cached
array, results in much more efficient access, and supplies to the JIT compiler more information that
enables it to more heavily optimize… goodness all around. This PR removed even more arrays in this
manner, as did dotnet/runtime#60411, dotnet/runtime#72743, dotnet/runtime#73115 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, and dotnet/runtime#70665.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans</p>
<p>CHAPTER  11</p>
<p>Regex</p>
<p>Back in May, I shared a fairly detailed post about the improvements coming to Regular Expressions in
.NET 7. As a recap, prior to .NET 5, Regex’s implementation had largely been untouched for quite
some time. In .NET 5, we brought it back up to be on par with or better than multiple other industry
implementations from a performance perspective. .NET 7 takes some significant leaps forward from
that. If you haven’t read the post yet, please go ahead and do so now; I’ll wait…</p>
<p>Welcome back. With that context, I’ll avoid duplicating content here, and instead focus on how exactly
these improvements came about and the PRs that did so.</p>
<p>RegexOptions.NonBacktracking</p>
<p>Let’s start with one of the larger new features in Regex, the new RegexOptions.NonBacktracking
implementation. As discussed in the previous post, RegexOptions.NonBacktracking switches the
processing of Regex over to using a new engine based in finite automata. It has two primary modes of
execution, one that relies on DFAs (deterministic finite automata) and one that relies on NFAs (non-
deterministic finite automata). Both implementations provide a very valuable guarantee: processing
time is linear in the length of the input. Whereas a backtracking engine (which is what Regex uses if
NonBacktracking isn’t specified) can hit a situation known as “catastrophic backtracking,” where
problematic expressions combined with problematic input can result in exponential processing in the
length of the input, NonBacktracking guarantees it’ll only ever do an ammortized-constant amount
of work per character in the input. In the case of a DFA, that constant is very small. With an NFA, that
constant can be much larger, based on the complexity of the pattern, but for any given pattern the
work is still linear in the length of the input.</p>
<p>A significant number of years of development went into the NonBacktracking implementation, which
was initially added into dotnet/runtime in dotnet/runtime#60607. However, the original research and
implementation for it actually came from Microsoft Research (MSR), and was available as an
experimental package in the form of the Symbolic Regex Matcher (SRM) library published by MSR.
You can still see vestiges of this in the current code now in .NET 7, but it’s evolved significantly, in
tight collaboration between developers on the .NET team and the researchers at MSR (prior to being
integrated in dotnet/runtime, it was incubated for over a year in dotnet/runtimelab, where the original
SRM code was brought in via dotnet/runtimelab#588 from <a href="https://github.com/veanes">@veanes</a>).</p>
<p>This implementation is based on the notion of regular expression derivatives, a concept that’s been
around for decades (the term was originally coined in a paper by Janusz Brzozowski in the 1960s) and
which has been significantly advanced for this implementation. Regex derivatives form the basis for
how the automata (think “graph”) used to process input are constructed. The idea at its core is fairly
simple: take a regex and process a single character… what is the new regex you get to describe what
remains after processing that one character? That’s the derivative. For example, given the regex \w{3}</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>to match three word characters, if you apply this to the next input character ‘a’, well, that will strip off
the first \w, leaving us with the derivative \w{2}. Simple, right? How about something more
complicated, like the expression .<em>(the|he). What happens if the next character is a t? Well, it’s
possible that t could be consumed by the .</em> at the beginning of the pattern, in which case the
remaining regex would be exactly the same as the starting one (.<em>(the|he)), since after matching t
we could still match exactly the same input as without the t. But, the t could have also been part of
matching the, and applied to the, we’d strip off the t and be left with he, so now our derivative is
.</em>(the|he)|he. Then what about the he in the original alternation? t doesn’t match h, so the
derivative would be nothing, which we’ll express here as an empty character class, giving us
.<em>(the|he)|he|[]. Of course, as part of an alternation, that “nothing” at the end is a nop, and so we
can simplify the whole derivative to just .</em>(the|he)|he… done. That was all when applying the
original pattern against a next t. What if it was against an h instead? Following the same logic as for
the t, this time we end up with .<em>(the|he)|e. And so on. What if we instead start with the h
derivative and the next character is an e? Then we’re taking the pattern .</em>(the|he)|e and applying it
to e. Against the left side of the alternation, it can be consumed by the .* (but doesn’t match either t
or h), and so we just end up with that same subexpression. But against the right side of the
alternation, e matches e, leaving us with the empty string (): .*(the|he)|(). At the point where a
pattern is “nullable” (it can match the empty string), that can be considered a match. We can visualize
this whole thing as a graph, with transitions for every input character to the derivative that comes
from applying it.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>Looks an awful lot like a DFA, doesn’t it? It should. And that’s exactly how NonBacktracking
constructs the DFAs it uses to process input. For every regex construct (concatenations, alternations,
loops, etc.) the engine knows how to derive the next regex based on the character being evaluated.
This application is done lazily, so we have an initial starting state (the original pattern), and then when
we evaluate the next character in the input, it looks to see whether there’s already a derivative
available for that transition: if there is, it follows it, and if there isn’t, it dynamically/lazily derives the
next node in the graph. At its core, that’s how it works.</p>
<p>Of course, the devil is in the details and there’s a ton of complication and engineering smarts that go
into making the engine efficient. One such example is a tradeoff between memory consumption and
throughput. Given the ability to have any char as input, you could have effectively ~65K transitions
out of every node (e.g. every node could need a ~65K element table); that would significantly increase
memory consumption. However, if you actually had that many transitions, it’s very likely a significant
majority of them would point to the same target node. Thus, NonBacktracking maintains its own
groupings of characters into what it calls “minterms.” If two characters will have exactly the same
transition, they’re part of the same minterm. The transitions are then constructed in terms of
minterms, with at most one transition per minterm out of a given node. When the next input character
is read, it maps that to a minterm ID, and then finds the appropriate transition for that ID; one
additional level of indirection in order to save a potentially huge amount of memory. That mapping is
handled via an array bitmap for ASCII and an efficient data structure known as a Binary Decision
Diagram (BDD) for everything above 0x7F.</p>
<p>As noted, the non-backtracking engine is linear in the length of the input. But that doesn’t mean it
always looks at each input character exactly once. If you call Regex.IsMatch, it does; after all, IsMatch
only needs to determine whether there is a match and doesn’t need to compute any additional
information, such as where the match actual starts or ends, any information on captures, etc. Thus, the
engine can simply employ its automata to walk along the input, transitioning from node to node in
the graph until it comes to a final state or runs out of input. Other operations, however, do require it
to gather more information. Regex.Match needs to compute everything, and that can actually entail
multiple walks over the input. In the initial implementation, the equivalent of Match would always take
three passes: match forwards to find the end of a match, then match a reversed-copy of the pattern in
reverse from that ending location in order to find where the match actually starts, and then once more
walk forwards from that known starting position to find the actual ending position. However, with
dotnet/runtime#68199 from <a href="https://github.com/olsaarik">@olsaarik</a>, unless captures are required, it
can now be done in only two passes: once forward to find the guaranteed ending location of the
match, and then once in reverse to find its starting location. And dotnet/runtime#65129 from
<a href="https://github.com/olsaarik">@olsaarik</a> added captures support, which the original implementation
also didn’t have. This captures support adds back a third pass, such that once the bounds of the
match are known, the engine runs the forward pass one more time, but this time with an NFA-based
“simulation” that is able to record “capture effects” on transitions. All of this enables the non-
backtracking implementation to have the exact same semantics as the backtracking engines, always
producing the same matches in the same order with the same capture information. The only
difference in this regard is, whereas with the backtracking engines capture groups inside of loops will
store all values captured in every iteration of the loop, only the last iteration is stored with the non-
backtracking implementation. On top of that, there are a few constructs the non-backtracking</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>implementation simply doesn’t support, such that attempting to use any of those will fail when trying
to construct the Regex, e.g. backreferences and lookarounds.</p>
<p>Even after its progress as a standalone library from MSR, more than 100 PRs went into making
RegexOptions.NonBacktracking what it is now in .NET 7, including optimizations like
dotnet/runtime#70217 from <a href="https://github.com/olsaarik">@olsaarik</a> that tries to streamline the tight
inner matching loop at the heart of the DFA (e.g. read the next input character, find the appropriate
transition to take, move to the next node, and check information about the node like whether it’s a
final state) and optimizations like dotnet/runtime#65637 from <a href="https://github.com/veanes">@veanes</a>
that optimized the NFA mode to avoid superfluous allocations, caching and reusing list and set
objects to make the handling of the lists of states ammortized allocation-free.</p>
<p>There’s one more set of PRs of performance interest for NonBacktracking. The Regex implementation
for taking patterns and turning them into something processable, regardless of which of the multiple
engines is being used, is essentially a compiler, and as with many compilers, it naturally lends itself to
recursive algorithms. In the case of Regex, those algorithms involve walking around trees of regular
expression constructs. Recursion ends up being a very handy way of expressing these algorithms, but
recursion also suffers from the possibility of stack overflow; essentially it’s using stack space as scratch
space, and if it ends up using too much, things go badly. One common approach to dealing with this
is turning the recursive algorithm into an iterative one, which typically involves using an explicit stack
of state rather than the implicit one. The nice thing about this is the amount of state you can store is
limited only by how much memory you have, as opposed to being limited by your thread’s stack
space. The downsides, however, are that it’s typically much less natural to write the algorithms in this
manner, and it typically requires allocating heap space for the stack, which then leads to additional
complications if you want to avoid that allocation, such as various kinds of pooling.
dotnet/runtime#60385 introduces a different approach for Regex, which is then used by
dotnet/runtime#60786 from <a href="https://github.com/olsaarik">@olsaarik</a> specifically in the
NonBacktracking implementation. It still uses recursion, and thus benefits from the expressiveness of
the recursive algorithm as well as being able to use stack space and thus avoid additional allocation in
the most common cases, but then to avoid stack overflows, it issues explicit checks to ensure we’re
not too deep on the stack (.NET has long provided the helpers
RuntimeHelpers.EnsureSufficientExecutionStack and
RuntimeHelpers.TryEnsureSufficientExecutionStack for this purpose). If it detects it’s too deep
on the stack, it forks off continued execution into another thread. Hitting this condition is expensive,
but it’s very rarely if ever actually hit in practice (e.g. the only time it’s hit in our vast functional tests
are in the tests explicitly written to stress it), it keeps the code simple, and it keeps the typical cases
fast. A similar approach is used in other areas of dotnet/runtime, such as in System.Linq.Expressions.</p>
<p>As was mentioned in my previous blog post about regular expressions, both the backtracking
implementations and the non-backtracking implementation have their place. The main benefit of the
non-backtracking implementation is predictability: because of the linear processing guarantee, once
you’ve constructed the regex, you don’t need to worry about malicious inputs causing worst-case
behavior in the processing of your potentially susceptible expressions. This doesn’t mean
RegexOptions.NonBacktracking is always the fastest; in fact, it’s frequently not. In exchange for
reduced best-case performance, it provides the best worst-case performance, and for some kinds of
applications, that’s a really worthwhile and valuable tradeoff.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>New APIs</p>
<p>Regex gets several new methods in .NET 7, all of which enable improved performance. The simplicity
of the new APIs likely also misrepresents how much work was necessary to enable them, in particular
because the new APIs all support ReadOnlySpan<char> inputs into the regex engines.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#65473 brings Regex into the span-based era of .NET, overcoming a significant
limitation in Regex since spans were introduced back in .NET Core 2.1. Regex has historically been
based on processing System.String inputs, and that fact pervades the Regex design and
implementation, including the APIs exposed for the extensibility model Regex.CompileToAssembly
relied on in .NET Framework (CompileToAssembly is now obsoleted and has never been functional in
.NET Core). One subtly that relies on the nature of string as the input is how match information is
returned to callers. Regex.Match returns a Match object that represents the first match in the input,
and that Match object exposes a NextMatch method that enables moving to the next match. That
means the Match object needs to store a reference to the input, so that it can be fed back into the
matching engine as part of such a NextMatch call. If that input is a string, great, no problem. But if
that input is a ReadOnlySpan<char>, that span as a ref struct can’t be stored on the class Match
object, since ref structs can only live on the stack and not the heap. That alone would make it a
challenge to support spans, but the problem is even more deeply rooted. All of the regex engines rely
on a RegexRunner, a base class that stores on it all of the state necessary to feed into the
FindFirstChar and Go methods that compose the actual matching logic for the regular expressions
(these methods contain all of the core code for performing the match, with FindFirstChar being an
optimization to skip past input positions that couldn’t possibly start a match and then Go performing
the actual matching logic). If you look at the internal RegexInterpreter type, which is the engine you
get when you construct a new Regex(...) without the RegexOptions.Compiled or
RegexOptions.NonBacktracking flags, it derives from RegexRunner. Similarly, when you use
RegexOptions.Compiled, it hands off the dynamic methods it reflection emits to a type derived from
RegexRunner, RegexOptions.NonBacktracking has a SymbolicRegexRunnerFactory that produces
types derived from RegexRunner, and so on. Most relevant here, RegexRunner is public, because the
types generated by the Regex.CompileToAssembly type (and now the regex source generator) include
ones derived from this RegexRunner. Those FindFirstChar and Go methods are thus abstract and
protected, and parameterless, because they pick up all the state they need from protected members
on the base class. That includes the string input to process. So what about spans? We could of
course have just called ToString() on an input ReadOnlySpan<char>. That would have been
functionally correct, but would have completely defeated the purpose of accepting spans, and worse,
would have been so unexpected as to likely cause consuming apps to be worse performing than they
would have without the APIs. Instead, we needed a new approach and new APIs.</p>
<p>First, we made FindFirstChar and Go virtual instead of abstract. The design that splits these methods
is largely antiquated, and in particular the forced separation between a stage of processing where you
find the next possible location of a match and then a stage where you actually perform the match at
that location doesn’t align well with all engines, like the one used by NonBacktracking (which initially
implemented FindFirstChar as a nop and had all its logic in Go). Then we added a new virtual Scan
method which, importantly, takes a ReadOnlySpan<char> as a parameter; the span can’t be exposed
from the base RegexRunner and must be passed in. We then implemented FindFirstChar and Go in
terms of Scan, and made them “just work.” Then, all of the engines are implemented in terms of that</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>span; they no longer need to access the protected RegexRunner.runtext, RegexRunner.runtextbeg,
and RegexRunner.runtextend members that surface the input; they’re just handed the span, already
sliced to the input region, and process that. One of the neat things about this from a performance
perspective is it enables the JIT to do a better job at shaving off various overheads, in particular
around bounds checking. When the logic is implemented in terms of string, in addition to the input
string itself the engine is also handed the beginning and end of the region of the input to process
(since the developer could have called a method like Regex.Match(string input, int beginning,
int length) in order to only process a substring). Obviously the engine matching logic is way more
complicated than this, but simplifying, imagine the entirety of the engine was just a loop over the
input. With the input, beginning, and length, that would look like:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
[Arguments(&quot;abc&quot;, 0, 3)]
public void Scan(string input, int beginning, int length)
{
for (int i = beginning; i &lt; length; i++)
{
Check(input[i]);
}
}</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
private void Check(char c) { }</p>
<p>That will result in the JIT generating assembly code along the lines of this:</p>
<p>; Program.Scan(System.String, Int32, Int32)
sub       rsp,28
cmp       r8d,r9d
jge       short M00_L01
mov       eax,[rdx+8]
M00_L00:
cmp       r8d,eax
jae       short M00_L02
inc       r8d
cmp       r8d,r9d
jl        short M00_L00
M00_L01:
add       rsp,28
ret
M00_L02:
call      CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL
int       3
; Total bytes of code 36</p>
<p>In contrast, if we’re dealing with a span, which already factors in the bounds, then we can write a more
canonical loop like this:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
[Arguments(&quot;abc&quot;)]
public void Scan(ReadOnlySpan<char> input)
{
for (int i = 0; i &lt; input.Length; i++)
{
Check(input[i]);
}
}</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
private void Check(char c) { }</p>
<p>And when it comes to compilers, something in a canonical form is really good, because the more
common the shape of the code, the more likely it is to be heavily optimized:</p>
<p>; Program.Scan(System.ReadOnlySpan`1<Char>)
mov       rax,[rdx]
mov       edx,[rdx+8]
xor       ecx,ecx
test      edx,edx
jle       short M00_L01
M00_L00:
mov       r8d,ecx
movsx     r8,word ptr [rax+r8*2]
inc       ecx
cmp       ecx,edx
jl        short M00_L00
M00_L01:
ret
; Total bytes of code 27</p>
<p>So even without all the other benefits that come from operating in terms of span, we immediately get
low-level code generation benefits from performing all the logic in terms of spans. While the above
example was made up (obviously the matching logic does more than a simple for loop), here’s a real
example. When a regex contains a \b, as part of evaluating the input against that \b the backtracking
engines call a RegexRunner.IsBoundary helper method which checks whether the character at the
current position is a word character and whether the character before it is a word character (factoring
in the bounds of the input as well). Here’s what the IsBoundary method based on string looked like
(the runtext it’s using is the name of the string field on RegexRunner that stores the input):</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
[Arguments(0, 0, 26)]
public bool IsBoundary(int index, int startpos, int endpos)
{
return (index &gt; startpos &amp;&amp; IsBoundaryWordChar(runtext[index - 1])) !=
(index &lt; endpos   &amp;&amp; IsBoundaryWordChar(runtext[index]));
}</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private bool IsBoundaryWordChar(char c) =&gt; false;</p>
<p>and here’s what the span version looks like:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
[Arguments(&quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;, 0)]
public bool IsBoundary(ReadOnlySpan<char> inputSpan, int index)
{
int indexM1 = index - 1;
return ((uint)indexM1 &lt; (uint)inputSpan.Length &amp;&amp;
IsBoundaryWordChar(inputSpan[indexM1])) !=
((uint)index &lt; (uint)inputSpan.Length &amp;&amp; IsBoundaryWordChar(inputSpan[index]));
}</p>
<p>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private bool IsBoundaryWordChar(char c) =&gt; false;</p>
<p>135</p>

<p>The most interesting thing to notice here is the:</p>
<p>call      CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL
int       3</p>
<p>at the end of the first version that doesn’t exist at the end of the second. As we saw earlier, this is
what the generated assembly looks like when the JIT is emitting the code to throw an index out of
range exception for an array, string, or span. It’s at the end because it’s considered to be “cold,” rarely
executed. It exists in the first because the JIT can’t prove based on local analysis of that function that
the runtext[index-1] and runtext[index] accesses will be in range of the string (it can’t know or
trust any implied relationship between startpos, endpos, and the bounds of runtext). But in the
second, the JIT can know and trust that the ReadOnlySpan<char>’s lower bound is 0 and upper bound
(exclusive) is the span’s Length, and with how the method is constructed, it can then prove that the
span accesses are always in bound. As such, it doesn’t need to emit any bounds checks in the method,
and the method then lacks the tell-tale signature of the index out of range throw. You can see more
examples of taking advantage of spans now being at the heart of the all of the engines in</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#66129, dotnet/runtime#66178, and dotnet/runtime#72728, all of which clean up
unnecessary checks against the bounds that are then always 0 and span.Length.</p>
<p>Ok, so the engines are now able to be handed span inputs and process them, great, what can we do
with that? Well, Regex.IsMatch is easy: it’s not encumbered by needing to perform multiple matches,
and thus doesn’t need to worry about how to store that input ReadOnlySpan<char> for the next
match. Similarly, the new Regex.Count, which provides an optimized implementation for counting
how many matches there are in the input, can bypass using Match or MatchCollection, and thus can
easily operate over spans as well; dotnet/runtime#64289 added string-based overloads, and
dotnet/runtime#66026 added span-based overloads. We can optimize Count further by passing
additional information into the engines to let them know how much information they actually need to
compute. For example, I noted previously that NonBacktracking is fairly pay-for-play in how much
work it needs to do relative to what information it needs to gather. It’s cheapest to just determine
whether there is a match, as it can do that in a single forward pass through the input. If it also needs
to compute the actual starting and ending bounds, that requires another reverse pass through some
of the input. And if it then also needs to compute capture information, that requires yet another
forward pass based on an NFA (even if the other two were DFA-based). Count needs the bounds
information, as it needs to know where to start looking for the next match, but it doesn’t need the
capture information, since none of that capture information is handed back to the caller.
dotnet/runtime#68242 updates the engines to receive this additional information, such that methods
like Count can be made more efficient.</p>
<p>So, IsMatch and Count can work with spans. But we still don’t have a method that lets you actually get
back that match information. Enter the new EnumerateMatches method, added by
dotnet/runtime#67794. EnumerateMatches is very similar to Match, except instead of handing back a
Match class instance, it hands back a ref struct enumerator:</p>
<p>public ref struct ValueMatchEnumerator
{
private readonly Regex _regex;
private readonly ReadOnlySpan<char> _input;
private ValueMatch _current;
private int _startAt;
private int _prevLen;
...
}</p>
<p>Being a ref struct, the enumerator is able to store a reference to the input span, and is thus able to
iterate through matches, which are represented by the ValueMatch ref struct. Notably, today
ValueMatch doesn’t provide capture information, which also enables it to partake in the optimizations
previously mentioned for Count. Even if you have an input string, EnumerateMatches is thus a way to
have ammortized allocation-free enumeration of all matches in the input. In .NET 7, though, there isn’t
a way to have such allocation-free enumeration if you also need all the capture data. That’s something
we’ll investigate designing in the future if/as needed.</p>
<p>TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the core of all of the engines is a Scan(ReadOnlySpan<char>) method that accepts
the input text to match, combines that with positional information from the base instance, and exits</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>when it either finds the location of the next match or exhausts the input without finding another. For
the backtracking engines, the implementation of that method is logically as follows:</p>
<p>protected override void Scan(ReadOnlySpan<char> inputSpan)
{
while (!TryMatchAtCurrentPosition(inputSpan) &amp;&amp;
base.runtextpos != inputSpan.Length)
{
base.runtextpos++;
}
}</p>
<p>We try to match the input at the current position, and if we’re successful in doing so, that’s it, we exit.
If the current position doesn’t match, however, then if there’s any input remaining we “bump” the
position and start the process over. In regex engine terminology, this is often referred to as a
“bumpalong loop.” However, if we actually ran the full matching process at every input character, that
could be unnecessarily slow. For many patterns, there’s something about the pattern that would
enable us to be more thoughtful about where we perform full matches, quickly skipping past locations
that couldn’t possibly match, and only spending our time and resources on locations that have a real
chance of matching. To elevate that concept to a first-class one, the backtracking engines’
“bumpalong loop” is typically more like the following (I say “typically” because in some cases the
compiled and source generated regexes are able to generate something even better).</p>
<p>protected override void Scan(ReadOnlySpan<char> inputSpan)
{
while (TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition(inputSpan) &amp;&amp;
!TryMatchAtCurrentPosition(inputSpan) &amp;&amp;
base.runtextpos != inputSpan.Length)
{
base.runtextpos++;
}
}</p>
<p>As with FindFirstChar previously, that TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition has the
responsibility of searching as quickly as possible for the next place to match (or determining that
nothing else could possibly match, in which case it would return false and the loop would exit). As
FindFirstChar, and it was embued with multiple ways of doing its job. In .NET 7,
TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition learns many more and improved ways of helping the engine
be fast.</p>
<p>In .NET 6, the interpreter engine had effectively two ways of implementing
TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition: a Boyer-Moore substring search if the pattern began with a
string (potentially case-insensitive) of at least two characters, and a linear scan for a character class
known to be the set of all possible chars that could begin a match. For the latter case, the interpreter
had eight different implementations for matching, based on a combination of whether
RegexOptions.RightToLeft was set or not, whether the character class required case-insensitive
comparison or not, and whether the character class contained only a single character or more than
one character. Some of these were more optimized than others, e.g. a left-to-right, case-sensitive,
single-char search would use an IndexOf(char) to search for the next location, an optimization
added in .NET 5. However, every time this operation was performed, the engine would need to
recompute which case it would be. dotnet/runtime#60822 improved this, introducing an internal</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>enum of the strategies used by TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition to find the next opportunity,
adding a switch to TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition to quickly jump to the right strategy,
and precomputing which strategy to use when the interpreter was constructed. This not only made
the interpreter’s implementation at match time faster, it made it effectively free (in terms of runtime
overhead at match time) to add additional strategies.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#60888 then added the first additional strategy. The implementation was already
capable of using IndexOf(char), but as mentioned previously in this post, the implementation of
IndexOf(ReadOnlySpan<char>) got way better in .NET 7 in many cases, to the point where it ends up
being significantly better than Boyer-Moore in all but the most corner of corner cases. So this PR
enables a new IndexOf(ReadOnlySpan<char>) strategy to be used to search for a prefix string in the
case where the string is case-sensitive.</p>

<p>dotnet/runtime#61490 then removed Boyer-Moore entirely. This wasn’t done in the previously
mentioned PR because of lack of a good way to handle case-insensitive matches. However, this PR
also special-cased ASCII letters to teach the optimizer how to turn an ASCII case-insensitive match
into a set of both casings of that letter (excluding the few known to be a problem, like i and k, which
can both be impacted by the employed culture and which might map case-insensitively to more than
two values). With enough of the common cases covered, rather than use Boyer-Moore to perform a
case-insensitive search, the implementation just uses IndexOfAny(char, char, ...) to search for
the starting set, and the vectorization employed by IndexOfAny ends up outpacing the old
implementation handily in real-world cases. This PR goes further than that, such that it doesn’t just
discover the “starting set,” but is able to find all of the character classes that could match a pattern a
fixed-offset from the beginning; that then gives the analyzer the ability to choose the set that’s
expected to be least common and issue a search for it instead of whatever happens to be at the
beginning. The PR goes even further, too, motivated in large part by the non-backtracking engine. The
non-backtracking engine’s prototype implementation also used IndexOfAny(char, char, ...) when
it arrived at a starting state and was thus able to quickly skip through input text that wouldn’t have a
chance of pushing it to the next state. We wanted all of the engines to share as much logic as
possible, in particular around this speed ahead, and so this PR unified the interpreter with the non-
backtracking engine to have them share the exact same TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition
routine (which the non-backtracking engine just calls at an appropriate place in its graph traversal
loop). Since the non-backtracking engine was already using IndexOfAny in this manner, initially not
doing so popped as a significant regression on a variety of patterns we measure, and this caused us to
invest in using it everywhere. This PR also introduced the first special-casing for case-insensitive
comparisons into the compiled engine, e.g. if we found a set that was [Ee], rather than emitting a</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>check akin to c == 'E' || c == 'e', we’d instead emit a check akin to (c | 0x20) == 'e' (those
fun ASCII tricks discussed earlier coming into play again).</p>

<p>The previous PR started turning IgnoreCase pattern text into sets, in particular for ASCII, e.g. (?i)a
would become [Aa]. That PR hacked in the support for ASCII knowing that something more complete
would be coming along, as it did in dotnet/runtime#67184. Rather than hardcoding the case-
insensitive sets that just the ASCII characters map to, this PR essentially hardcodes the sets for every
possible char. Once that’s done, we no longer need to know about case-insensitivity at match time
and can instead just double-down on efficiently matching sets, which we already need to be able to
do well. Now, I said it encodes the sets for every possible char; that’s not entirely true. If it were true,
that would take up a large amount of memory, and in fact, most of that memory would be wasted
because the vast majority of characters don’t participate in case conversion… there are only ~2,000
characters that we need to handle. As such, the implementation employs a three-tier table scheme.
The first table has 64 elements, dividing the full range of chars into 64 groupings; of those 64 groups,
54 of them have no characters that participate in case conversion, so if we hit one of those entries, we
can immediately stop the search. For the remaining 10 that do have at least one character in their
range participating, the character and the value from the first table are used to compute an index into
the second table; there, too, the majority of entries say that nothing participates in case conversion.
It’s only if we get a legitimate hit in the second table does that give us an index into the third table, at
which location we can find all of the characters considered case-equivalent with the first.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#63477 (and then later improved in dotnet/runtime#66572) proceeded to add another
searching strategy, this one inspired by nim-regex’s literal optimizations. There are a multitude of
regexes we track from a performance perspective to ensure we’re not regressing in common cases
and to help guide investments. One is the set of patterns in mariomka/regex-benchmark languages
regex benchmark. One of those is for URIs:
(@&quot;[\w]+://[^/\s?#]+[^\s?#]+(?:?[^\s#]<em>)?(?:#[^\s]</em>)?&quot;. This pattern defies the thus-far
enabled strategies for finding a next good location, as it’s guaranteed to begin with a “word
character” (\w), which includes ~50,000 of the ~65,000 possible characters; we don’t have a good way
of vectorizing a search for such a character class. However, this pattern is interesting in that it begins
with a loop, and not only that, it’s an upper-unbounded loop which our analysis will determine is
atomic, because the character guaranteed to immediately follow the loop is a ':', which is itself not a
word character, and thus there’s nothing the loop could match and give up as part of backtracking
that would match ':'. That all lends itself to a different approach to vectorization: rather than trying
to search for the \w character class, we can instead search for the substring &quot;://&quot;, and then once we</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>find it, we can match backwards through as many [\w]s as we can find; in this case, the only
constraint is we need to match at least one. This PR added that strategy, for a literal after an atomic
loop, to all of the engines.</p>

<p>Of course, as has been talked about elsewhere, the best optimizations aren’t ones that make
something faster but rather ones that make something entirely unnecessary. That’s what
dotnet/runtime#64177 does, in particular in relation to anchors. The .NET regex implementation has
long had optimizations for patterns with a starting anchor: if the pattern begins with ^, for example
(and RegexOptions.Multiline wasn’t specified), the pattern is rooted to the beginning, meaning it
can’t possibly match at any position other than 0; as such, with such an anchor,
TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition won’t do any searching at all. The key here, though, is being
able to detect whether the pattern begins with such an anchor. In some cases, like ^abc$, that’s trivial.
In other cases, like ^abc|^def, the existing analysis had trouble seeing through that alternation to find
the guaranteed starting ^ anchor. This PR fixes that. It also adds a new strategy based on discovering
that a pattern has an ending anchor like $. If the analysis engine can determine a maximum number of
characters for any possible match, and it has such an anchor, then it can simply jump to that distance
from the end of the string, and bypass even looking at anything before then.</p>

<p>dotnet/runtime#67732 is another PR related to improving anchor handling. It’s always fun when a bug
fix or code simplification refactoring turns into a performance improvement. The PR’s primary purpose
was to simplify some complicated code that was computing the set of characters that could possibly
start a match. It turns out that complication was hiding a logic bug which manifested in it missing
some opportunities to report valid starting character classes, the impact of which is that some
searches which could have been vectorized weren’t. By simplifying the implementation, the bug was
fixed, exposing more performance opportunities.</p>

<p>By this point, the engines are able to use IndexOf(ReadOnlySpan<char>) to find a substring at the
beginning of a pattern. But sometimes the most valuable substring isn’t at the beginning, but
somewhere in the middle or even at the end. As long as it’s at a fixed-offset from the beginning of the
pattern, we can search for it, and then just back-off by the offset to the position we should actually try
running the match. dotnet/runtime#67907 does exactly that.</p>

<p>Loops and Backtracking</p>
<p>Loop handling in the compiled and source generated engines has been significantly improved, both
with respect to processing them faster and with respect to backtracking less.</p>
<p>With regular greedy loops (e.g. c*), there are two directions to be concerned about: how quickly can
we consume all the elements that match the loop, and how quickly can we give back elements that
might be necessary as part of backtracking for the remainder of the expression to match. And with
lazy loops, we’re primarily concerned with backtracking, which is the forward direction (since lazy
loops consume as part of backtracking rather than giving back as part of backtracking). With PRs
dotnet/runtime#63428, dotnet/runtime#68400, dotnet/runtime#64254, and dotnet/runtime#73910, in
both the compiler and source generator we now make full use of effectively all of the variants of
IndexOf, IndexOfAny, LastIndexOf, LastIndexOfAny, IndexOfAnyExcept, and
LastIndexOfAnyExcept in order to speed along these searches. For example, in a pattern like .*abc,
the forward direction of that loop entails consuming every character until the next newline, which we
can optimize with an IndexOf('\n'). Then as part of backtracking, rather than giving up one
character at a time, we can LastIndexOf(&quot;abc&quot;) in order to find the next viable location that could
possibly match the remainder of the pattern. Or for example, in a pattern like [^a-c]*def, the loop
will initially greedily consume everything other than 'a', 'b', or 'c', so we can use
IndexOfAnyExcept('a', 'b', 'c') to find the initial end of the loop. And so on. This can yield huge
performance gains, and with the source generator, also makes the generated code more idiomatic
and easier to understand.</p>

<p>Sometimes optimizations are well-intended but slightly miss the mark. dotnet/runtime#63398 fixes
such an issue with an optimization introduced in .NET 5; the optimization was valuable but only for a
subset of the scenarios it was intended to cover. While TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition’s
primary raison d’être is to update the bumpalong position, it’s also possible for
TryMatchAtCurrentPosition to do so. One of the occasions in which it’ll do so is when the pattern
begins with an upper-unbounded single-character greedy loop. Since processing starts with the loop
having fully consumed everything it could possibly match, subsequent trips through the scan loop
don’t need to reconsider any starting position within that loop; doing so would just be duplicating
work done in a previous iteration of the scan loop. And as such, TryMatchAtCurrentPosition can
update the bumpalong position to the end of the loop. The optimization added in .NET 5 was dutifully
doing this, and it did so in a way that fully handled atomic loops. But with greedy loops, the updated
position was getting updated every time we backtracked, meaning it started going backwards, when it
should have remained at the end of the loop. This PR fixes that, yielding significant savings in the
additional covered cases.</p>

<p>As mentioned elsewhere, the best optimizations are those that make work entirely vanish rather than
just making work faster. dotnet/runtime#68989, dotnet/runtime#63299, and dotnet/runtime#63518
do exactly that by improving the pattern analyzers ability to find and eliminate more unnecessary
backtracking, a process the analyzer refers to as “auto-atomicity” (automatically making loops atomic).
For example, in the pattern a*?b, we have a lazy loop of 'a's followed by a b. That loop can only
match 'a's, and 'a' doesn’t overlap with 'b'. So let’s say the input is &quot;aaaaaaaab&quot;. The loop is lazy,
so we’ll start out by trying to match just 'b'. It won’t match, so we’ll backtrack into the lazy loop and
try to match &quot;ab&quot;. It won’t match so we’ll backtrack into the lazy loop and try to match &quot;aab&quot;. And so
on, until we’ve consumed all the 'a's such that the rest of the pattern has a chance of matching the
rest of the input. That’s exactly what an atomic greedy loop does, so we can transform the pattern
a*?b into (?&gt;a*)b, which is much more efficiently processed. In fact, we can see exactly how it’s
processed just by looking at the source-generated implementation of this pattern:</p>
<p>private bool TryMatchAtCurrentPosition(ReadOnlySpan<char> inputSpan)
{
int pos = base.runtextpos;
int matchStart = pos;
ReadOnlySpan<char> slice = inputSpan.Slice(pos);</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>// Match 'a' atomically any number of times.
{
int iteration = slice.IndexOfAnyExcept('a');
if (iteration &lt; 0)
{
iteration = slice.Length;
}</p>
<pre><code>    slice = slice.Slice(iteration);
    pos += iteration;
}

// Advance the next matching position.
if (base.runtextpos &lt; pos)
{
    base.runtextpos = pos;
}

// Match &#x27;b&#x27;.
if (slice.IsEmpty || slice[0] != &#x27;b&#x27;)
{
    return false; // The input didn&#x27;t match.
}

// The input matched.
pos++;
base.runtextpos = pos;
base.Capture(0, matchStart, pos);
return true;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>(Note that those comments aren’t ones I added for this blog post; the source generator itself is
emitting commented code.)</p>
<p>When a regular expression is input, it’s parsed into a tree-based form. The “auto-atomicity” analysis
discussed in the previous PR is one form of analysis that walks around this tree looking for
opportunities to transform portions of the tree into a behaviorally equivalent alternative that will be
more efficient to execute. Several PRs introduced additional such transformations.
dotnet/runtime#63695, for example, looks for “empty” and “nothing” nodes in the tree that can be
removed. An “empty” node is something that matches the empty string, so for example in the
alternation abc|def||ghi, the third branch of that alternation is empty. A “nothing” node is
something that can’t match anything, so for example in the concatenation abc(?!)def, that (?!) in
middle is a negative lookahead around an empty, which can’t possibly match anything, as it’s saying
the expression won’t match if it’s followed by an empty string, which everything is. These constructs
often arise as a result of other transformations rather than being something a developer typically
writes by hand, just as there are optimizations in the JIT where you might look at them and say “why
on earth is that something a developer would write” but it ends up being a valuable optimization
anyways because inlining might transform perfectly reasonable code into something that matches the
target pattern. Thus, for example, if you did have abc(?!)def, since that concatenation requires the
(?!) to match in order to be successful, the concatenation itself can simply be replaced by a
“nothing.” You can see this easily if you try this with the source generator:</p>
<p>[GeneratedRegex(@&quot;abc(?!)def&quot;)]</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>as it will produce a Scan method like this (comment and all):</p>
<p>protected override void Scan(ReadOnlySpan<char> inputSpan)
{
// The pattern never matches anything.
}</p>
<p>Another set of transformations was introduced in dotnet/runtime#59903, specifically around
alternations (which beyond loops are the other source of backtracking). This introduced two main
optimizations. First, it enables rewriting alternations into alternations of alternations, e.g. transforming
axy|axz|bxy|bxz into ax(?:y|z)|bx(?:y|z), which is then further reduced into ax[yz]|bx[yz]. This
can enable the backtracking engines to more efficiently process alternations due to fewer branches
and thus less potential backtracking. The PR also enabled limited reordering of branches in an
alternation. Generally branches can’t be reordered, as the order can impact exactly what’s matched
and what’s captured, but if the engine can prove there’s no effect on ordering, then it’s free to
reorder. One key place that ordering isn’t a factor is if the alternation is atomic due to it being
wrapped in an atomic group (and the auto-atomicity analysis will add such groups implicitly in some
situations). Reordering the branches then enables other optimizations, like the one previously
mentioned from this PR. And then once those optimizations have kicked in, if we’re left with an atomic
alternation where every branch begins with a different letter, than can enable further optimizations in
terms of how the alternation is lowered; this PR teaches the source generator how to emit a switch
statement, which leads to both more efficient and more readable code. (The detection of whether
nodes in the tree are atomic, and other such properties such as performing captures or introducing
backtracking, turned out to be valuable enough that dotnet/runtime#65734 added dedicated support
for this.)</p>
<p>Code generation</p>
<p>The .NET 7 regex implementation has no fewer than four engines: the interpreter (what you get if you
don’t explicitly choose another engine), the compiler (what you get with RegexOptions.Compiled),
the non-backtracking engine (what you get with RegexOptions.NonBacktracking), and the source
generator (what you get with [GeneratedRegex(...)]). The interpreter and the non-backtracking
engine don’t require any kind of code generation; they’re both based on creating in-memory data
structures that represent how to match input against the pattern. The other two, though, both
generate code specific to the pattern; the generated code is code attempting to mimick what you
might write if you weren’t using Regex at all and were instead writing code to perform a similar match
directly. The source generator spits out C# that’s compiled directly into your assembly, and the
compiler spits out IL at run-time via reflection emit. The fact that these are generating code specific to
the pattern means there’s a ton of opportunity to optimize.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#59186 provided the initial implementation of the source generator. This was a direct
port of the compiler, effectively a line-by-line translation of IL into C#; the result is C# akin to what
you’d get if you were to run the generated IL through a decompiler like ILSpy. A bunch of PRs then
proceeded to iterate on and tweak the source generator, but the biggest improvements came from
changes that changed the compiler and the source generator together. Prior to .NET 5, the compiler
spit out IL that was very similar to what the interpreter would do. The interpreter is handed a series of
instructions that it walks through one by one and interprets, and the compiler, handed that same</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>series of instructions, would just emit the IL for processing each. It had some opportunity for being
more efficient, e.g. loop unrolling, but a lot of value was left on the table. In .NET 5, an alternate path
was added in support of patterns without backtracking; this code path was based on being handed
the parsed node tree rather than being based on the series of instructions, and that higher-level form
enabled the compiler to derive more insights about the pattern that it could then use to generate
more efficient code. In .NET 7, support for all regex features were incrementally added in, over the
course of multiple PRs, in particular dotnet/runtime#60385 for backtracking single char loops,
dotnet/runtime#61698 for backtracking single char lazy loops, dotnet/runtime#61784 for other
backtracking lazy loops, and dotnet/runtime#61906 for other backtracking loops as well as back
references and conditionals. At that point, the only features missing were support for
RegexOptions.RightToLeft and lookbehinds (which are implemented in terms of right-to-left), and
we decided based on relatively little use of these features that we needn’t keep around the old
compiler code just to enable them. So, dotnet/runtime#62318 deleted the old implementation. But,
even though these features are relatively rare, it’s a lot easier to tell a story that “all patterns are
supported” than one that requires special callouts and exceptions, so dotnet/runtime#66127 and
dotnet/runtime#66280 added full lookbehind and RightToLeft support such that there were no
takebacks. At this point, both the compiler and source generator now supported everything the
compiler previously did, but now with the more modernized code generation. This code generation is
in turn what enables many of the optimizations previously discussed, e.g. it provides the opportunity
to use APIs like LastIndexOf as part of backtracking, which would have been near impossible with the
previous approach.</p>
<p>One of the great things about the source generator emitting idiomatic C# is it makes it easy to iterate.
Every time you put in a pattern and see what the generator emits, it’s like being asked to do a code
review of someone else’s code, and you very frequently see something “new” worthy of comment, or
in this case, improving the generator to address the issue. And so a bunch of PRs were originated
based on reviewing what the generator emitted and then tweaking the generator to do better (and
since the compiler was effectively entirely rewritten along with the source generator, they maintain the
same structure, and it’s easy to port improvements from one to the other). For example,
dotnet/runtime#68846 and dotnet/runtime#69198 tweaked how some comparisons were being
performed in order for them to convey enough information to the JIT that it can eliminate some
subsequent bounds checking, and dotnet/runtime#68490 recognized a variety of conditions being
emitted that could never happen in some situations observable statically and was able to elide all that
code gen. It also became obvious that some patterns didn’t need the full expressivity of the scan loop,
and a more compact and customized Scan implementation could be used. dotnet/runtime#68560
does that, such that, for example, a simple pattern like hello won’t emit a loop at all and will instead
have a simpler Scan implementation like:</p>
<p>protected override void Scan(ReadOnlySpan<char> inputSpan)
{
if (TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition(inputSpan))
{
// The search in TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition performed the entire match.
int start = base.runtextpos;
int end = base.runtextpos = start + 5;
base.Capture(0, start, end);
}
}</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 | Regex</p>
<p>The compiler and source generator were also updated to take advantage of newer features.
dotnet/runtime#63277, for example, teaches the source generator how to determine if unsafe code is
allowed, and if it is, it emits a [SkipLocalsInit] for the core logic; the matching routine can result in
many locals being emitted, and SkipLocalsInit can make it cheaper to call the function due to less
zero’ing being necessary. Then there’s the issue of where the code is generated; we want helper
functions (like the \w IsWordChar helper introduced in dotnet/runtime#62620) that can be shared
amongst multiple generated regexes, and we want to be able to share the exact same regex
implementation if the same pattern/options/timeout combination are used in multiple places in the
same assembly (dotnet/runtime#66747), but doing so then exposes this implementation detail to user
code in the same assembly. To still be able to get the perf benefits of such code sharing while
avoiding the resulting complications, dotnet/runtime#66432 and then dotnet/runtime#71765 teaches
the source generator to use the new file-local types features in C# 11 (dotnet/roslyn#62375).</p>
<p>One last and interesting code generation aspect is in optimizations around character class matching.
Matching character classes, whether ones explicitly written by the developer or ones implicitly created
by the engine (e.g. as part of finding the set of all characters that can begin the expression), can be
one of the more time-consuming aspects of matching; if you imagine having to evaluate this logic for
every character in the input, then how many instructions needs to be executed as part of matching a
character class directly correlates to how long it takes to perform the overall match. We thus spend
some time trying to ensure we generate optimal matching code for as many categories of character
classes as possible. dotnet/runtime#67365, for example, improved a bunch of cases found to be
common in real-world use, like specially-recognizing sets like [\d\D], [\s\S], and [\w\W] as meaning
“match anything” (just as is the case for . in RegexOptions.Singleline mode), in which case existing
optimizations around the handling of “match anything” can kick in.</p>

<p>Other changes impacting character class code generation included dotnet/runtime#72328, which
improved the handling of character classes that involve character class subtraction;
dotnet/runtime#72317 from <a href="https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis">@teo-tsirpanis</a>, which enabled
additional cases where the generator could avoid emitting a bitmap lookup; dotnet/runtime#67133,
which added a tighter bounds check when it does emit such a lookup table; and
dotnet/runtime#61562, which enables better normalization of character classes in the engine’s
internal representation, thus leading to downstream optimizations better recognizing more character
classes.</p>
<p>Finally, with all of these improvements to Regex, a multitude of PRs fixed up regexes being used
across dotnet/runtime, in various ways. dotnet/runtime#66142, dotnet/runtime#66179 from
<a href="https://github.com/Clockwork-Muse">@Clockwork-Muse</a>, and dotnet/runtime#62325 from
<a href="https://github.com/Clockwork-Muse">@Clockwork-Muse</a> all converted Regex usage over to using
[GeneratedRegex(...)]. dotnet/runtime#68961 optimized other usage in various ways. The PR
replaced several regex.Matches(...).Success calls with IsMatch(...), as using IsMatch has less
overhead due to not needing to construct a Match instance and due to being able to avoid more
expensive phases in the non-backtracking engine to compute exact bounds and capture information.
The PR also replaced some Match/Match.MoveNext usage with EnumerateMatches, in order to avoid
needing Match object allocations. The PR also entirely removed at least one regex usage that was just
as doable as a cheaper IndexOf. dotnet/runtime#68766 also removed a use of
RegexOptions.CultureInvariant. Specifying CultureInvariant changes the behavior of
IgnoreCase by alternating which casing tables are employed; if IgnoreCase isn’t specified and there’s
no inline case-insensitivity options ((?i)), then specifying CultureInvariant is a nop. But a
potentially expensive one. For any code that’s size conscious, the Regex implementation is structured
in a way as to try to make it as trimmmer friendly as possible. If you only ever do new
Regex(pattern), we’d really like to be able to statically determine that the compiler and non-
backtracking implementations aren’t needed such that the trimmer can remove it without having a
visible and meaningful negative impact. However, the trimmer analysis isn’t yet sophisticated enough
to see exactly which options are used and only keep the additional engines linked in if
RegexOptions.Compiled or RegexOptions.NonBacktracking is used; instead, any use of an overload
that takes a RegexOptions will result in that code continuing to be referenced. By getting rid of the
options, we increase the chances that no code in the app is using this constructor, which would in turn
enable this constructor, the compiler, and the non-backtracking implementation to be trimmed away.</p>

<p>System.Collections hasn’t seen as much investment in .NET 7 as it has in previous releases, though
many of the lower-level improvements have a trickle-up effect into collections as well. For example,
Dictionary&lt;,&gt;’s code hasn’t changed between .NET 6 and .NET 7, but even so, this benchmark
focused on dictionary lookups:</p>
<p>private Dictionary&lt;int, int&gt; _dictionary = Enumerable.Range(0, 10_000).ToDictionary(i =&gt;
i);</p>
<p>[Benchmark]

Dictionary&lt;int, int&gt; dictionary = _dictionary;
int sum = 0;</p>

{
    if (dictionary.TryGetValue(i, out int value))
    {
        sum += value;
    }
}

return sum;

<p>Beyond that, there have been explicit improvements elsewhere in collections. ImmutableArray<T>, for
example. As a reminder, ImmutableArray<T> is a very thin struct-based wrapper around a T[] that
hides the mutability of T[]; unless you’re using unsafe code, neither the length nor the shallow
contents of an ImmutableArray<T> will ever change (by shallow, I mean the data stored directly in
that array can’t be mutated, but if there are mutable reference types stored in the array, those
instances themselves may still have their data mutated). As a result, ImmutableArray<T> also has an
associated “builder” type, which does support mutation: you create the builder, populate it, and then
transfer that contents to an ImmutableArray<T> which is frozen forevermore. In
dotnet/runtime#70850 from <a href="https://github.com/grbell-ms">@grbell-ms</a>, the builder’s Sort method is
changed to use a span, which in turn avoids an IComparer<T> allocation and a Comparison<T></p>
<p>150</p>
<p>CHAPTER 12 | Collections</p>
<p>allocation, while also speeding up the sort itself by removing several layers of indirection from every
comparison.</p>

<p>dotnet/runtime#61196 from <a href="https://github.com/lateapexearlyspeed">@lateapexearlyspeed</a> brings
ImmutableArray<T> into the span-based era, adding around 10 new methods to ImmutableArray<T>
that interoperate with Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T>. These are valuable from a performance
perspective because it means if you have your data in a span, you can get it into an
ImmutableArray<T> without incurring additional allocations beyond the one the ImmutableArray<T>
itself will create. dotnet/runtime#66550 from <a href="https://github.com/RaymondHuy">@RaymondHuy</a> also
adds a bunch of new methods to the immutable collection builders, which provide efficient
implementations for operations like replacing elements and adding, inserting, and removing ranges.</p>
<p>SortedSet<T> also saw some improvements in .NET 7. For example, SortedSet<T> internally uses a
red/black tree as its internal data structure, and it uses a Log2 operation to determine the maximum
depth the tree could be for a given node count. Previously, that operation was implemented as a loop.
But thanks to dotnet/runtime#58793 from <a href="https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis">@teo-tsirpanis</a> that
implementation is now simply a call to BitOperations.Log2, which is in turn implemented trivially in
terms of one of multiple hardware intrinsics if they’re supported (e.g. Lzcnt.LeadingZeroCount,
ArmBase.LeadingZeroCount, X86Base.BitScanReverse). And dotnet/runtime#56561 from
<a href="https://github.com/johnthcall">@johnthcall</a> improves SortedSet<T> copy performance by
streamlining how the iteration through the nodes in the tree is handled.</p>

<p>One last PR to look at in collections: dotnet/runtime#67923. ConditionalWeakTable&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;
is a collection most developers haven’t used, but when you need it, you need it. It’s used primarily for
two purposes: to associate additional state with some object, and to maintain a weak collection of
objects. Essentially, it’s a thread-safe dictionary that doesn’t maintain strong references to anything it
stores but ensures that the value associated with a key will remain rooted as long as the associated
key is rooted. It exposes many of the same APIs as ConcurrentDictionary&lt;,&gt;, but for adding items
to the collection, it’s historically only had an Add method. That means if the design of the consuming
code entailed trying to use the collection as a set, where duplicates were common, it would also be
common to experience exceptions when trying to Add an item that already existed in the collection.
Now in .NET 7, it has a TryAdd method, which enables such usage without potentially incurring the
costs of such exceptions (and without needing to add try/catch blocks to defend against them).</p>

<p>CHAPTER 12 | Collections</p>
<p>CHAPTER  13</p>
<p>LINQ</p>
<p>Let’s move on to Language-Integrated Query (LINQ). LINQ is a productivity feature that practically
every .NET developer uses. It enables otherwise complicated operations to be trivially expressed,
whether via language-integrated query comprehension syntax or via direct use of methods on
System.Linq.Enumerable. That productivity and expressivity, however, comes at a bit of an overhead
cost. In the vast majority of situations, those costs (such as delegate and closure allocations, delegate
invocations, use of interface methods on arbitrary enumerables vs direct access to indexers and
Length/Count properties, etc.) don’t have a significant impact, but for really hot paths, they can and
do show up in a meaningful way. This leads some folks to declare LINQ as being broadly off-limits in
their codebases. From my perspective, that’s misguided; LINQ is extremely useful and has its place. In
.NET itself, we use LINQ, we’re just practical and thoughtful about where, avoiding it in code paths
we’ve optimized to be lightweight and fast due to expectations that such code paths could matter to
consumers. And as such, while LINQ itself may not perform as fast as a hand-rolled solution, we still
care a lot about the performance of LINQ’s implementation, so that it can be used in more and more
places, and so that where it’s used there’s as little overhead as possible. There are also differences
between operations in LINQ; with over 200 overloads providing various kinds of functionality, some of
these overloads benefit from more performance tuning than do others, based on their expected
usage.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#64470 is the result of analyzing various real-world code bases for use of
Enumerable.Min and Enumerable.Max, and seeing that it’s very common to use these with arrays,
often ones that are quite large. This PR updates the Min<T>(IEnumerable<T>) and
Max<T>(IEnumerable<T>) overloads when the input is an int[] or long[] to vectorize the
processing, using Vector<T>. The net effect of this is significantly faster execution time for larger
arrays, but still improved performance even for short arrays (because the implementation is now able
to access the array directly rather than going through the enumerable, leading to less allocation and
interface dispatch and more applicable optimizations like inlining).</p>

<p>One of the more interesting aspects of the PR, however, is one line that’s meant to help with the non-
array cases. In performance optimization, and in particular when adding “fast paths” to better handle
certain cases, there’s almost always a winner and a loser: the winner is the case the optimization is
intended to help, and the loser is every other case that’s penalized by whatever checks are necessary
to determine whether to take the improved path. An optimization that special-cases arrays might
normally look like:</p>
<p>if (source is int[] array)
{
ProcessArray(array);
}
else
{
ProcessEnumerable(source);
}</p>
<p>However, if you look at the PR, you’ll see the if condition is actually:</p>
<p>if (source.GetType() == typeof(int[]))</p>
<p>How come? Well at this point in the code flow, we know that source isn’t null, so we don’t need the
extra null check that is will bring. However, that’s minor compared to the real impact here, that of
support for array covariance. It might surprise you to learn that there are types beyond int[] that will
satisfy a source is int check… try running Console.WriteLine((object)new uint[42] is
int[]);, and you’ll find it prints out True. (This is also a rare case where the .NET runtime and C# the
language disagree on aspects of the type system. If you change that
Console.WriteLine((object)new uint[42] is int[]); to instead be Console.WriteLine(new
uint[42] is int[]);, i.e. remove the (object) cast, you’ll find it starts printing out False instead of
True. That’s because the C# compiler believes it’s impossible for a uint[] to ever be an int[], and
thus optimizes the check away entirely to be a constant false.) Thus the runtime is having to do more
work as part of the type check than just a simple comparison against the known type identity of</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>CHAPTER 13 | LINQ</p>
<p>int[]. We can see this by looking at the assembly generated for these two methods (the latter
assumes we’ve already null-checked the input, which is the case in these LINQ methods):</p>
<p>public IEnumerable<object> Inputs { get; } = new[] { new object() };</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
[ArgumentsSource(nameof(Inputs))]
public bool M1(object o) =&gt; o is int[];</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
[ArgumentsSource(nameof(Inputs))]
public bool M2(object o) =&gt; o.GetType() == typeof(int[]);</p>
<p>This results in:</p>
<p>; Program.M1(System.Object)
sub       rsp,28
mov       rcx,offset MT_System.Int32[]
call      qword ptr
[System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CastHelpers.IsInstanceOfAny(Void*, System.Object)]
test      rax,rax
setne     al
movzx     eax,al
add       rsp,28
ret

<p>; Program.M2(System.Object)

cmp       [rdx],rax
sete      al
movzx     eax,al
ret
; Total bytes of code 20</p>
<p>Note the former involves a method call to the JIT’s CastHelpers.IsInstanceOfAny helper method,
and that it’s not inlined. That in turn impacts performance:</p>
<p>private IEnumerable<int> _source = (int[])(object)new uint[42];</p>
<p>[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]

<p>24 B</p>
<p>Of course, these two operations aren’t semantically equivalent, so if this was for something that
required the semantics of the former, we couldn’t use the latter. But in the case of this LINQ
performance optimization, we can choose to only optimize the int[] case, forego the super rare case</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>CHAPTER 13 | LINQ</p>
<p>of the int[] actually being a uint[] (or e.g. DayOfWeek[]), and minimize the performance penalty of
the optimization for IEnumerable<int> inputs other than int[] to just a few quick instructions.</p>
<p>This improvement was built upon further in dotnet/runtime#64624, which expands the input types
supported and the operations that take advantage. First, it introduced a private helper for extracting a
ReadOnlySpan<T> from certain types of IEnumerable<T> inputs, namely today those inputs that are
actually either a T[] or a List<T>; as with the previous PR, it uses the GetType() == typeof(T[])
form to avoid significantly penalizing other inputs. Both of these types enable extracting a
ReadOnlySpan<T> for the actual storage, in the case of T[] via a cast and in the case of List<T> via
the CollectionsMarshal.AsSpan method that was introduced in .NET 5. Once we have that span, we
can do a few interesting things. This PR:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Expands the previous Min<T>(IEnumerable<T>) and Max<T>(IEnumerable<T>) optimizations to
not only apply to int[] and long[] but also to List<int> and List<long>.</p>
<p>Uses direct span access for Average<T>(IEnumerable<T>) and Sum<T>(IEnumerable<T>) for T
being int, long, float, double, or decimal, all for arrays and lists.</p>

<p>The previous LINQ PRs were examples from making existing operations faster. But sometimes
performance improvements come about from new APIs that can be used in place of previous ones in
certain situations to further improve performance. One such example of that comes from new APIs
introduced in dotnet/runtime#70525 from <a href="https://github.com/deeprobin">@deeprobin</a> which were
then improved in dotnet/runtime#71564. One of the most popular methods in LINQ is
Enumerable.OrderBy (and its inverse OrderByDescending), which enables creating a sorted copy of
the input enumerable. To do so, the caller passes a Func&lt;TSource,TKey&gt; predicate to OrderBy which
OrderBy uses to extract the comparison key for each item. However, it’s relatively common to want to
sort items with themselves as the keys; this is, after all, the default for methods like Array.Sort, and in
such cases callers of OrderBy end up passing in an identity function, e.g. OrderBy(x =&gt; x). To
eliminate that cruft, .NET 7 introduces the new Order and OrderDescending methods, which, in the
spirit of pairs like Distinct and DistinctBy, perform that same sorting operation, just with an implicit
x =&gt; x done on behalf of the caller. But beyond performance, a nice benefit of this is the
implementation then knows that the keys will all be the same as the inputs, and it no longer needs to
invoke the callback for each item to retrieve its key nor allocate a new array to store those keys. Thus
if you find yourself using LINQ and reaching for OrderBy(x =&gt; x), consider instead using Order()
and reaping the (primarily allocation) benefits:</p>

<p>File I/O</p>
<p>.NET 6 saw some huge file I/O improvements, in particular a complete rewrite of FileStream. While
.NET 7 doesn’t have any single changes on that scale, it does have a significant number of
improvements that measurably “move the needle,” and in variety of ways.</p>
<p>One form of performance improvement that also masquerades as a reliability improvement is
increasing responsiveness to cancellation requests. The faster something can be canceled, the sooner
the system is able to give back valuable resources in use, and the sooner things waiting for that
operation to complete are able to be unblocked. There have been several improvements of this ilk in
.NET 7.</p>
<p>In some cases, it comes from adding cancelable overloads where things weren’t previously cancelable
at all. That’s the case for dotnet/runtime#61898 from <a href="https://github.com/bgrainger">@bgrainger</a>,
which added new cancelable overloads of TextReader.ReadLineAsync and
TextReader.ReadToEndAsync, and that includes overrides of these methods on StreamReader and
StringReader; dotnet/runtime#64301 from <a href="https://github.com/bgrainger">@bgrainger</a> then
overrode these methods (and others missing overrides) on the NullStreamReader type returned from
TextReader.Null and StreamReader.Null (interestingly, these were defined as two different types,
unnecessarily, and so this PR also unified on just having both use the StreamReader variant, as it
satisfies the required types of both). You can see this put to good use in dotnet/runtime#66492 from
<a href="https://github.com/lateapexearlyspeed">@lateapexearlyspeed</a>, which adds a new
File.ReadLinesAsync method. This produces an IAsyncEnumerable<string> of the lines in the file,
is based on a simple loop around the new StreamReader.ReadLineAsync overload, and is thus itself
fully cancelable.</p>
<p>From my perspective, though, a more interesting form of this is when an existing overload is
purportedly cancelable but isn’t actually. For example, the base Stream.ReadAsync method just wraps
the Stream.BeginRead/EndRead methods, which aren’t cancelable, so if a Stream-derived type doesn’t
override ReadAsync, attempts to cancel a call to its ReadAsync will be minimally effective. It does an
up-front check for cancellation, such that if cancellation was requested prior to the call being made, it
will be immediately canceled, but after that check the supplied CancellationToken is effectively
ignored. Over time we’ve tried to stamp out all remaining such cases, but a few stragglers have
remained. One pernicious case has been with pipes. For this discussion, there are two relevant kinds of
pipes, anonymous and named, which are represented in .NET as pairs of streams:
AnonymousPipeClientStream/AnonymousPipeServerStream and
NamedPipeClientStream/NamedPipeServerStream. Also, on Windows, the OS makes a distinction
between handles opened for synchronous I/O from handles opened for overlapped I/O (aka
asynchronous I/O), and this is reflected in the .NET API: you can open a named pipe for synchronous
or overlapped I/O based on the PipeOptions.Asynchronous option specified at construction. And, on</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>CHAPTER 14 | File I/O</p>
<p>Unix, named pipes, contrary to their naming, are actually implemented on top of Unix domain sockets.
Now some history:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>.NET Framework 4.8: No cancellation support. The pipe Stream-derived types didn’t even
override ReadAsync or WriteAsync, so all they got was the default up-front check for
cancellation and then the token was ignored.</p>
<p>.NET Core 1.0: On Windows, with a named pipe opened for asynchronous I/O, cancellation was
fully supported. The implementation would register with the CancellationToken, and upon a
cancellation request, would use CancelIoEx for the NativeOverlapped* associated with the
asynchronous operation. On Unix, with named pipes implemented in terms of sockets, if the pipe
was opened with PipeOptions.Asynchronous, the implementation would simulate cancellation
via polling: rather than simply issuing the Socket.ReceiveAsync/Socket.SendAsync (which
wasn’t cancelable at the time), it would queue a work item to the ThreadPool, and that work
item would run a polling loop, making Socket.Poll calls with a small timeout, checking the
token, and then looping around to do it again until either the Poll indicated the operation
would succeed or cancellation was requested. On both Windows and Unix, other than a named
pipe opened with Asynchronous, after the operation was initated, cancellation was a nop.</p>
<p>.NET Core 2.1: On Unix, the implementation was improved to avoid the polling loop, but it still
lacked a truly cancelable Socket.ReceiveAsync/Socket.SendAsync. Instead, by this point
Socket.ReceiveAsync supported zero-byte reads, where a caller could pass a zero-length buffer
to ReceiveAsync and use that as notification for data being available to consume without
actually consuming it. The Unix implementation for asynchronous named pipe streams then
changed to issue zero-byte reads, and would await a Task.WhenAny of both that operation’s
task and a task that would be completed when cancellation was requested. Better, but still far
from ideal.</p>
<p>.NET Core 3.0: On Unix, Socket got truly cancelable ReceiveAsync and SendAsync methods,
which asynchronous named pipes were updated to utilize. At this point, the Windows and Unix
implementations were effectively on par with regards to cancellation; both good for
asynchronous named pipes, and just posing for everything else.</p>
<p>.NET 5: On Unix, SafeSocketHandle was exposed and it became possible to create a Socket for
an arbitrary supplied SafeSocketHandle, which enabled creating a Socket that actually referred
to an anonymous pipe. This in tern enabled every PipeStream on Unix to be implemented in
terms of Socket, which enabled ReceiveAsync/SendAsync to be fully cancelable for both
anonymous and named pipes, regardless of how they were opened.</p>
<p>So by .NET 5, the problem was addressed on Unix, but still an issue on Windows. Until now. In .NET 7,
we’ve made the rest of the operations fully cancelable on Windows as well, thanks to
dotnet/runtime#72503 (and a subsequent tweak in dotnet/runtime#72612). Windows doesn’t support
overlapped I/O for anonymous pipes today, so for anonymous pipes and for named pipes opened for
synchronous I/O, the Windows implementation would just delegate to the base Stream
implementation, which would queue a work item to the ThreadPool to invoke the synchronous
counterpart, just on another thread. Instead, the implementations now queue that work item, but
instead of just calling the synchronous method, it does some pre- and post- work that registers for
cancellation, passing in the thread ID of the thread that’s about to perform the I/O. If cancellation is
requested, the implementation then uses CancelSynchronousIo to interrupt it. There’s a race
condition here, in that the moment the thread registers for cancellation, cancellation could be
requested, such that CancelSynchronousIo could be called before the operation is actually initiated.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>CHAPTER 14 | File I/O</p>
<p>So, there’s a small spin loop employed, where if cancellation is requested between the time
registration occurs and the time the synchronous I/O is actually performed, the cancellation thread
will spin until the I/O is initiated, but this condition is expected to be exceedingly rare. There’s also a
race condition on the other side, that of CancelSynchronousIo being requested after the I/O has
already completed; to address that race, the implementation relies on the guarantees made by
CancellationTokenRegistration.Dispose, which promises that the associated callback will either
never be invoked or will already have fully completed executing by the time Dispose returns. Not only
does this implementation complete the puzzle such that all asynchronous read/write operations on
both anonymous and named pipes on both Windows and Unix are cancelable, it also actually
improves normal throughput.</p>

<p>The rest of the performance-focused changes around I/O in .NET 7 were primarily focused on one of
two things: reducing syscalls, and reducing allocation.</p>
<p>Several PRs went into reducing syscalls on Unix as part of copying files, e.g. File.Copy and
FileInfo.CopyTo. dotnet/runtime#59695 from <a href="https://github.com/tmds">@tmds</a> reduced overheads
in several ways. The code had been performing a stat call in order to determine up front whether the
source was actually a directory, in which case the operation would error out. Instead, the PR simply
tries to open the source file, which it would need to do anyway for the copy operation, and then it
only performs that stat if opening the file fails. If opening the file succeeds, the code was already
performing an fstat to gather data on the file, such as whether it was seekable; with this change, it
now also extracts from the results of that single fstat the source file size, which it then threads
through to the core copy routine, which itself is then able to avoid an fstat syscall it had been
performing in order to get the size. Saving those syscalls is great, in particular for very small files
where the overhead of setting up the copy can actually be more expensive than the actual copy of the
bytes. But the biggest benefit of this PR is that it takes advantage of IOCTL-FICLONERANGE on Linux.
Some Linux file systems, like XFS and Btrfs, support “copy-on-write,” which means that rather than
copying all of the data to a new file, the file system simply notes that there are two different files
pointing to the same data, sharing the underlying storage. This makes the “copy” super fast, since
nothing actually needs to be copied and instead the file system just needs to update some
bookkeeping; plus, less space is consumed on disk, since there’s just a single store of the data. The file
system then only needs to actually copy data that’s overwritten in one of the files. This PR uses ioctl
and FICLONE to perform the copy as copy-on-write if the source and destination file system are the
same and the file system supports the operation. In a similar vein, dotnet/runtime#64264 from
<a href="https://github.com/tmds">@tmds</a> further improves File.Copy/FileInfo.CopyTo by utilizing
copy_file_range on Linux if it’s supported (and only if it’s a new enough kernel that it addresses</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>CHAPTER 14 | File I/O</p>
<p>some issues the function had in previous releases). Unlike a typical read/write loop that reads the data
from the source and then writes it to the destination, copy_file_range is implemented to stay
entirely in kernel mode, without having to transition to user space for each read and write.</p>
<p>Another example of avoiding syscalls comes for the File.WriteXx and File.AppendXx methods when
on Unix. The implementation of these methods opens a FileStream or a SafeFileHandle directly,
and it was specifying FileOptions.SequentialScan. SequentialScan is primarily relevant for reading
data from a file, and hints to OS caching to expect data to be read from the file sequentially rather
than randomly. However, these write/append methods don’t read, they only write, and the
implementation of FileOptions.SequentialScan on Unix requires an additional syscall via
posix_fadvise (passing in POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL); thus, we’re paying for a syscall and not
benefiting from it. This situation is akin to the famous Henny Youngman joke: “The patient says,
‘Doctor, it hurts when I do this’; the doctor says, ‘Then don’t do that!’.” Here, too, the answer is “don’t
do that,” and so dotnet/runtime#59247 from <a href="https://github.com/tmds">@tmds</a> simply stops passing
SequentialScan in places where it won’t help but may hurt.</p>
<p>Directory handling has seen reduced syscalls across the directory lifecycle, especially on Unix.
dotnet/runtime#58799 from <a href="https://github.com/tmds">@tmds</a> speeds up directory creation on Unix.
Previously, the implementation of directory creation would first check to see if the directory already
existed, which involves a syscall. In the expected minority case where it already existed the code could
early exit out. But in the expected more common case where the directory didn’t exist, it would then
parse the file path to find all of the directories in it, walk up the directory list until it found one that
did exist, and then try to create all of the subdirectories back down through the target one. However,
the expected most common case is the parent directories already exist and the child directory doesn’t,
in which case we’re still paying for all that parsing when we could have just created the target
directory. This PR addresses that by changing the up-front existence check to instead simply try to
mkdir the target directory; if it succeeds, great, we’re done, and if it fails, the error code from the
failure can be used instead of the existence check to know whether mkdir failed because it had no
work to do. dotnet/runtime#61777 then takes this a step further and avoids string allocations while
creating directories by using stack memory for the paths temporarily needed to pass to mkdir.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#63675 then improves the performance of moving directories, on both Unix and
Windows, removing several syscalls. The shared code for Directory.Move and DirectorInfo.MoveTo
was doing explicit directory existence checks for the source and destination locations, but on
Windows the Win32 API called to perform the move does such checks itself, so they’re not needed
preemptively. On Unix, we can similarly avoid the existence check for the source directory, as the
rename function called will similarly simply fail if the source doesn’t exist (with an appropriate error
that let’s us deduce what went wrong so the right exception can be thrown), and for the destination,
the code had been issuing separate existence checks for whether the destination existed as a directory
or as a file, but a single stat call suffices for both.</p>

<p>And then also on Unix, dotnet/runtime#59520 from <a href="https://github.com/tmds">@tmds</a> improves
directory deletion, and in particular recursive deletion (deleting a directory and everything it contains
and everything they contain and so on), by utilizing the information already provided by the file
system enumeration to avoid a secondary existence check.</p>
<p>Syscalls were also reduced as part of support for memory-mapped files. dotnet/runtime#63754 takes
advantage of special-casing to do so while opening a MemoryMappedFile. When
MemoryMappedFile.CreateFromFile was called, one of the first things it would do is call File.Exists
to determine whether the specified file already exists; that’s because later in the method as part of
dealing with errors and exceptions, the implementation needs to know whether to delete the file that
might then exist; the implementation constructs a FileStream, and doing might will the specified file
into existence. However, that only happens for some FileMode values, which is configurable via an
argument passed by callers of CreateFromFile. The common and default value of FileMode is
FileMode.Open, which requires that the file exist such that constructing the FileStream will throw if it
doesn’t. That means we only actually need to call File.Exists if the FileMode is something other
than Open or CreateNew, which means we can trivially avoid the extra system call in the majority case.
dotnet/runtime#63790 also helps here, in two ways. First, throughout the CreateFromFile operation,
the implementation might access the FileStream’s Length multiple times, but each call results in a
syscall to read the underlying length of the file. We can instead read it once and use that one value for
all of the various checks performed. Second, .NET 6 introduced the File.OpenHandle method which
enables opening a file handle / file descriptor directly into a SafeFileHandle, rather than having to go
through FileStream to do so. The use of the FileStream in MemoryMappedFile is actually quite
minimal, and so it makes sense to just use the SafeFileHandle directly rather than also constructing
the superfluous FileStream and its supporting state. This helps to reduce allocations.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s dotnet/runtime#63794, which recognizes that a MemoryMappedViewAccessor or
MemoryMappedViewStream opened for read-only access can’t have been written to. Sounds obvious,
but the practical implication of this is that closing either needn’t bother flushing, since that view
couldn’t have changed any data in the implementation, and flushing a view can be relatively
expensive, especially for larger views. Thus, a simple change to avoid flushing if the view isn’t writable
can yield a measurable improvement to MemoryMappedViewAccessor/MemoryMappedviewStream’s
Dispose.</p>

<p>Beyond system calls, there have also been a plethora of improvements around reducing allocation.
One such change is dotnet/runtime#58167, which improved the performance of the commonly-used
File.WriteAllText{Async} and File.AppendAllText{Async} methods. The PR recognizes two
things: one, that these operations are common enough that it’s worth avoiding the small-but-
measurable overhead of going through a FileStream and instead just going directly to the
underlying SafeFileHandle, and, two, that since the methods are passed the entirety of the payload
to output, the implementation can use that knowledge (in particular for length) to do better than the
StreamWriter that was previously employed. In doing so, the implementation avoids the overheads
(primarily in allocation) of the streams and writers and temporary buffers.</p>

<p>dotnet/runtime#61519 similarly updates File.ReadAllBytes{Async} to use SafeFileHandle (and
RandomAccess) directly rather than going through FileStream, shaving off some allocation from each
use. It also makes the same SequentialScan change as mentioned earlier. While this case is about
reading (whereas the previous change saw SequentialScan being complete overhead with no
benefit), ReadAllBytes{Async} is very frequently used to read smaller files where the overhead of the
additional syscall can measure up to 10% of the total cost (and for larger files, modern kernels are
pretty good about caching even without a sequentiality hint, so there’s little downside measured
there).</p>
<p>Another such change is dotnet/runtime#68662, which improved Path.Join’s handling of null or
empty path segments. Path.Join has overloads that accept strings and overloads that accept
ReadOnlySpan<char>s, but all of the overloads produce strings. The string-based overloads just
wrapped each string in a span and delegated to the span-based overloads. However, in the event that
the join operation is a nop (e.g. there are two path segments and the second is empty so the join
should just return the first), the span-based implementation still needs to create a new string (there’s
no way for the ReadOnlySpan<char>-based overloads to extract a string from the span). As such, the
string-based overloads can do a little bit better in the case of one of them being null or empty; they
can do the same thing the Path.Combine overloads do, which is to have the M argument overload
delegate to the M-1 argument overload, filtering out a null or empty, and in the base case of the
overload with two arguments, if a segment is null or empty, the other (or empty) can just be returned
directly.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a multitude of allocation-focused PRs, such as dotnet/runtime#69335 from
<a href="https://github.com/pedrobsaila">@pedrobsaila</a> which adds a fast-path based on stack allocation to
the internal ReadLink helper that’s used on Unix anywhere we need to follow symlinks, or
dotnet/runtime#68752 that updates NamedPipeClientStream.ConnectAsync to remove a delegate
allocation (by passing state into a Task.Factory.StartNew call explicitly), or dotnet/runtime#69412
which adds an optimized Read(Span<byte>) override to the Stream returned from
Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream.</p>
<p>But my personal favorite improvement in this area come from dotnet/runtime#69272, which adds a
few new helpers to Stream:</p>
<p>public void ReadExactly(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count);
public void ReadExactly(Span<byte> buffer);</p>
<p>public ValueTask ReadExactlyAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken
cancellationToken = default);
public ValueTask ReadExactlyAsync(Memory<byte> buffer, CancellationToken cancellationToken
= default);</p>
<p>public int ReadAtLeast(Span<byte> buffer, int minimumBytes, bool throwOnEndOfStream =
true);
public ValueTask<int> ReadAtLeastAsync(Memory<byte> buffer, int minimumBytes, bool
throwOnEndOfStream = true, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);</p>
<p>In fairness, these are more about usability than they are about performance, but in this case there’s a
tight correlation between the two. It’s very common to write these helpers one’s self (the
aforementioned PR deleted many open-coded loops for this functionality from across the core
libraries) as the functionality is greatly needed, and it’s unfortunately easy to get them wrong in ways</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>CHAPTER 14 | File I/O</p>
<p>that negatively impact performance, such as by using a Stream.ReadAsync overload that needs to
allocate a returned Task<int> or reading fewer bytes than is allowed as part of a read call. These
implementations are correct and efficient.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>CHAPTER 14 | File I/O</p>
<p>CHAPTER  15</p>
<p>Compression</p>
<p>.NET Core 2.1 added support for the Brotli compression algorithm, surfacing it in two ways:
BrotliStream and the pair of BrotliEncoder/BrotliDecoder structs that BrotliStream is itself built
on top of. For the most part, these types just provide wrappers around a native C implementation
from google/brotli, and so while the .NET layer has the opportunity to improve how data is moved
around, managed allocation, and so on, the speed and quality of the compression itself are largely at
the mercy of the C implementation and the intricacies of the Brotli algorithm.</p>
<p>As with many compression algorithms, Brotli provides a knob that allows for a quintessential tradeoff
to be made between compression speed (how fast data can be compressed) and compression
quality/ratio (how small can the compressed output be made). The hand-wavy idea is the more time
the algorithm spends looking for opportunity, the more space can be saved. Many algorithms expose
this as a numerical dial, in Brotli’s case going from 0 (fastest speed, least compression) to 11 (spend as
much time as is needed to minimize the output size). But while BrotliEncoder surfaces that same
range, BrotliStream’s surface area is simpler: most use just specifies that compression should be
performed (e.g. new BrotliStream(destination, CompressionMode.Compress)) and the only knob
available is via the CompressionLevel enum (e.g. new BrotliStream(destination,
CompressionLevel.Fastest)), which provides just a few options: CompressionLevel.NoCompression,
CompressionLevel.Fastest, CompressionLevel.Optimal, and CompressionLevel.SmallestSize.
This means the BrotliStream implementation needs to select a default value when no
CompressionLevel is specified and needs to map CompressionLevel to an underlying numerical
value when one is.</p>
<p>For better or worse (and I’m about to argue “much worse”), the native C implementation itself defines
the default to be 11 (google/brotli#encode.h), and so that’s what BrotliStream has ended up using
when no CompressionLevel is explicitly specified. Further, the CompressionLevel.Optimal enum
value is poorly named. It’s intended to represent a good default that’s a balanced tradeoff between
speed and quality; that’s exactly what it means for DeflateStream, GZipStream, and ZLibStream. But
for BrotliStream, as the default it similarly got translated to mean the underlying native library’s
default, which is 11. This means that when constructing a BrotliStream with either
CompressionMode.Compress or CompressionLevel.Optimal, rather than getting a nice balanced

<p>Is that so bad? Maybe compression quality is the most important thing? For example, reducing the
size of data can make it faster to then transmit it over a wire, and with a slow connection, size then
meaningfully translates into end-to-end throughput.</p>
<p>The problem is just how much this extra effort costs. Compression speed and ratio are highly
dependent on the data being compressed, so take this example with a small grain of salt as it’s not
entirely representative of all use, but it’s good enough for our purposes. Consider this code, which</p>

<p>The code is measuring how long it takes to compress the input data at each of the levels (doing a
warmup and then averaging several iterations), timing how long it takes and capturing the resulting

<p>This chart shows an almost exponential increase in processing time as we near the upper end of the
dial, with quality level 11 compressing ~33% better than quality level 0 but taking ~440x as long to
achieve that. If that’s what a developer wants, they can specify CompressionLevel.SmallestSize, but
that cost by default and for the balanced CompressionLevel.Optimal is far out of whack.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#72266 fixes that. A very small change, it simply makes CompressMode.Compress and
CompressionLevel.Optimal for Brotli map to quality level 4, which across many kinds of inputs does
represent a fairly balanced trade-off between size and speed.</p>

iteration of a loop rather than allocating a new buffer for each iteration, dotnet/runtime#66764 which
uses spans judiciously to avoid a bunch of superfluous string and string[] allocations from
System.IO.Packaging, and dotnet/runtime#73082 updating the zlib implementations shipped as part
of .NET from v1.2.11 (which was released in January 2017) to v1.2.12 (which was released in March
2022).</p>

<p>CHAPTER 15 | Compression</p>
<p>CHAPTER  16</p>
<p>Networking</p>
<p>Networking is the life-blood of almost every service, with performance being critical to success. In
previous releases, a lot of effort was focused on the lower layers of the networking stack, e.g. .NET 5
saw a significant investment in improving the performance of sockets on Linux. In .NET 7, much of the
effort is above sockets.</p>
<p>That said, there were some interesting performance improvements in sockets itself for .NET 7. One of
the more interesting is dotnet/runtime#64770, which revamped how some synchronization is handled
inside of SocketsAsyncEventArgs. As background, in the early days of networking in .NET Framework,
asynchrony was enabled via Begin/End methods (the “APM” pattern). This pattern is not only
complicated to use well, it’s relatively inefficient, resulting in allocation for every single operation
performed (at a minimum for the IAsyncResult object that’s returned from the BeginXx method). To
help make networking operations more efficient, SocketsAsyncEventArgs was introduced.
SocketsAsyncEventArgs is a reusable class you allocate to hold all of the state associated with
asynchronous operations: allocate one, pass it to various async methods (e.g. ReceiveAsync), and
then completion events are raised on the SocketAsyncEventArgs instance when the operation
completes. It can be quite efficient when used correctly, but it’s also complicated to use correctly. In
subsequent releases, Task-based and ValueTask-based APIs were released; these have the efficiency
of SocketAsyncEventArgs and the ease-of-use of async/await, and are the recommended starting
point for all Socket-based asynchronous programming today. They have the efficiency of
SocketAsyncEventArgs because they’re actually implemented as a thin veneer on top of it under the
covers, and so while most code these days isn’t written to use SocketAsyncEventArgs directly, it’s still
very relevant from a performance perspective.</p>
<p>SocketAsyncEventArgs on Windows is implemented to use winsock and overlapped I/O. When you
call an async method like ValueTask<Socket> Socket.AcceptAsync(CancellationToken), that grabs
an internal SocketAsyncEventArgs and issues an AcceptAsync on it, which in turn gets a
NativeOverlapped* from the ThreadPoolBoundHandle associated with the socket, and uses it to issue
the native AcceptEx call. When that handle is initially created, we set the
FILE_SKIP_COMPLETION_PORT_ON_SUCCESS completion notification mode on the socket; use of this
was introduced in earlier releases of .NET Core, and it enables a significant number of socket
operations, in particular sends and receives, to complete synchronously, which in turn saves
unnecessary trips through the thread pool, unnecessary unwinding of async state machines, and so
on. But it also causes a condundrum. There are some operations we want to perform associated with
asynchronous operation but that have additional overhead, such as registering for the cancellation of
those operations, and we don’t want to pay the cost of doing them if the operation is going to
complete synchronously. That means we really want to delay performing such registration until after
we’ve made the native call and discovered the operation didn’t complete synchronously… but at that
point we’ve already initiated the operation, so if it doesn’t complete synchronously, then we’re now in</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>a potential race condition, where our code that’s still setting up the asynchronous operation is racing
with it potentially completing in a callback on another thread. Fun. SocketAsyncEventArgs handled
this race condition with a spin lock; the theory was that contention would be incredibly rare, as the
vast majority cases would either be the operation completing synchronously (in which case there’s no
other thread involved) or asynchronously with enough of a delay that the small amount of additional
work performed by the initiating thread would have long ago completed by the time the
asynchronous operation completed. And for the most part, that was true. However, it turns out that
it’s actually much more common than expected for certain kinds of operations, like Accepts. Accepts
end up almost always completing asynchronously, but if there’s already a pending connection,
completing asynchronously almost immediately, which then induces this race condition to happen
more frequently and results in more contention on the spin locks. Contention on a spin lock is
something you really want to avoid. And in fact, for a particular benchmark, this spin lock showed up
as the cause for an almost 300% slowdown in requests-per-second (RPS) for a benchmark that used a
dedicated connection per request (e.g. with every response setting “Connection: close”).
dotnet/runtime#64770 changed the synchronization mechanism to no longer involve a spin lock;
instead, it maintains a simple gate implemented as an Interlocked.CompareExchange. If the initiating
thread gets to the gate first, from that point on the operation is considered asynchronous and any
additional work is handled by the completing callback. Conversely, if the callback gets to the gate first,
the initiating thread treats the operation as if it completed synchronously. This not only avoids one of
the threads spinning while waiting for the other to make forward progress, it also increases the
number of operations that end up being handled as synchronous, which in turn reduces other costs
(e.g. the code awaiting the task returned from this operation doesn’t need to hook up a callback and
exit, and can instead itself continue executing synchronously). The impact of this is difficult to come
up with a microbenchmark for, but it can have meaningful impact for loaded Windows servers that
end up accepting significant numbers of connections in steady state.</p>
<p>A more-easily quantifiable change around sockets is dotnet/runtime#71090, which improves the
performance of SocketAddress.Equals. A SocketAddress is the serialized form of an EndPoint, with
a byte[] containing the sequence of bytes that represent the address. Its Equals method, used to
determine whether to SocketAddress instances are the same, looped over that byte[] byte-by-byte.
Not only is such code gratuitous when there are now helpers available like SequenceEqual for
comparing spans, doing it byte-by-byte is also much less efficient than the vectorized implementation
in SequenceEqual. Thus, this PR simply replaced the open-coded comparison loop with a call to
SequenceEqual.</p>
<p>private SocketAddress _addr = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(&quot;123.123.123.123&quot;),
80).Serialize();
private SocketAddress _addr_same = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(&quot;123.123.123.123&quot;),

<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>Let’s move up to some more interesting changes in the layers above Sockets, starting with
SslStream.</p>
<p>One of the more impactful changes to SslStream on .NET 7 is in support for TLS resumption on Linux.
When a TLS connection is established, the client and server engage in a handshake protocol where
they collaborate to decide on a TLS version and cipher suites to use, authenticate and validate each
other’s identity, and create symmetric encryption keys for use after the handshake. This represents a
significant portion of the time required to establish a new connection. For a client that might
disconnect from a server and then reconnect later, as is fairly common in distributed applications, TLS
resumption allows a client and server to essentially pick up where they left off, with the client and/or
server storing some amount of information about recent connections and using that information to
resume. Windows SChannel provides default support for TLS resumption, and thus the Windows
implementation of SslStream (which is built on SChannel) has long had support for TLS resumption.
But OpenSSL’s model requires additional code to enable TLS resumption, and such code wasn’t
present in the Linux implementation of SslStream. With dotnet/runtime#57079 and
dotnet/runtime#63030, .NET 7 adds server-side support for TLS resumption (using the variant that
doesn’t require storing recent connection state on the server), and with dotnet/runtime#64369, .NET 7
adds client-side support (which does require storing additional state). The effect of this is significant, in
particular for a benchmark that opens and closes lots of connections between clients.</p>

<p>Another significant improvement for SslStream in .NET 7 is support for OCSP stapling. When a client
handshakes with the server and the server shares its certificate, a client that cares about validating it’s
talking to exactly who it intended to talk to needs to validate that certificate. In the days of yore, such
validation was done with certificate revocation lists (CRL), where periodically the client would
download a giant list of certificates known to be revoked. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is
a newer protocol and mechanism that enables a client to get real-time information about a certificate;
while the client handshakes with the server and the server sends the client its certificate, the client
then connects to an “OCSP responder” and sends it a request to determine whether the certificate is
considered good. OCSP has multiple issues of its own, however. In particular, it places a significant
load on these OCSP responder servers, with every client making a real-time request to it about every
certificate encountered, and also potentially significantly increasing the time it takes the client to
establish a connection. OCSP stapling offers a solution to this. Rather than a client issuing a request to</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>the OCSP responder, the server itself contacts the OCSP responder and gets a signed ticket from the
OCSP responder stating that the server’s certificate is good and will be for some period of time. When
a client handshakes with the server, the server can then “staple” (include) this signed ticket as part of
its response to the client, giving the validation to the client directly rather than the client needing to
make a separate roundtrip to the OCSP responder. This reduces overheads for everyone involved.
dotnet/runtime#67011 adds support for OCSP stapling to SslStream client usage on Linux, with
dotnet/runtime#69833 adding the Linux server-side counterpart, and dotnet/runtime#71570 adds
client-side support for Windows.</p>
<p>The aforementioned changes are primarily about the performance of opening a connection.
Additional work has been done to improve that further in other ways. dotnet/runtime#69527 gets rid
of allocations associated with several SafeHandle instances that were being created unnecessarily on
Linux as part of establishing a TLS connection. This highlights the benefits of doing profiling on
multiple platforms, as while these SafeHandles were necessary in the Windows implementation, they
were fairly meaningless in the Linux implementation (due to differences between SChannel and
OpenSSL), and were only brought along for the ride because of how the platform-abstraction layer
(PAL) was defined to reuse most of the SslStream code across platforms. And dotnet/runtime#68188
avoids several collections allocated as part of the TLS handshake. This one is particularly interesting as
it’s come up multiple times in the past in various libraries. Imagine you have a lazily initialized
property like this:</p>
<p>private List<T>? _items;
public List<T> Items =&gt; _items ??= new List<T>();</p>
<p>And then some code in the same implementation comes along and wants to read the contents of
these items. That code might look like:</p>
<p>if (Items.Count &gt; 0) { ... }</p>
<p>but the very act of accessing Items just to check its count forces the collection into existence (with a 0
Count). If the code instead checks:</p>
<p>if (_items is List<T> items &amp;&amp; items.Count &gt; 0) { ... }</p>
<p>It can save that unnecessary collection allocation. The approach is made even simpler with C# pattern
matching:</p>
<p>if (_items is { Count: &gt; 0 }) items) { ... }</p>
<p>This is one of those things that’s incredibly obvious once you “see” it and realize what’s happening,
but you often miss until it jumps out at you in a profiler.</p>
<p>dotnet/runtime#69098 is another good example of how profiling can lead to insights about
allocations that can be removed. Application-Layer Protocol Negotation (ALPN) allows code
establishing a TLS connection to piggy-back on the roundtrips that are being used for the TLS
handshake anyway to negotiate some higher-level protocol that will end up being used as well. A very
common use-case, for example, is for an HTTPS client/server to negotiate which version of HTTP
should be used. This information is exposed from SslStream as an SslApplicationProtocol struct
returned from its NegotiatedApplicationProtocol property, but as the actual negotiated protocol
can be arbitrary data, SslApplicationProtocol just wraps a byte[]. The implementation had been</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>dutifully allocating a byte[] to hold the bytes passed around as part of ALPN, since we need such a
byte[] to store in the SslApplicationProtocol. But while the byte data can be arbitrary, in practice
by far the most common byte sequences are equivalent to “http/1.1” for HTTP/1.1, “h2” for HTTP/2,
and “h3” for HTTP/3. Thus, it makes sense to special-case those values and use a reusable cached
byte[] singleton when one of those values is needed. If SslApplicationProtocol exposed the
underlying byte[] directly to consumers, we’d be hesitant to use such singletons, as doing so would
mean that if code wrote into the byte[] it would potentially be changing the value for other
consumers in the same process. However, SslApplicationProtocol exposes it as a
ReadOnlyMemory<byte>, which is only mutable via unsafe code (using the
MemoryMarshal.TryGetArray method), and once you’re employing unsafe code to do “bad” things,&quot;
all bets are off anyway. dotnet/runtime#63674 also removes allocations related to ALPN, in this case
avoiding the need for a byte[] allocation on Linux when setting the negotiated protocol on a client
SslStream. It uses stack memory instead of an array allocation for protocols up to 256 bytes in length,
which is way larger than any in known use, and thus doesn’t bother to do anything fancy for the
fallback path, which will never be used in practice. And dotnet/runtime#69103 further avoids ALPN-
related allocations and work on Windows by entirely skipping some unnecessary code paths: various
methods can be invoked multiple times during a TLS handshake, but even though the ALPN-related
work only needed to happen once the first time, the code wasn’t special-casing it and was instead
repeating the work over and over.</p>
<p>Everything discussed thus far was about establishing connections. What about the performance of
reading and writing on that connection? Improvements have been made there, too, in particular
around memory management and asynchrony. But first we need some context.</p>
<p>When async/await were first introduced, Task and Task<TResult> were the only game in town; while
the pattern-based mechanism the compiler supports for arbitrary “task-like” types enabled async
methods to return other types, in practice it was only tasks (which also followed our guidance). We
soon realized, however, that a significant number of calls to a significant number of commonly-used
async APIs would actually complete synchronously. Consider, for example, a method like
MemoryStream.ReadAsync: MemoryStream is backed entirely by an in-memory buffer, so even though
the operation is “async,” every call to it completes synchronously, as the operation can be performed
without doing any potentially long-running I/O. Or consider FileStream.ReadAsync. By default
FileStream employs its own internal buffer. If you issue a call to FileStream.ReadAsync with your
own buffer and ask for only, say, 16 bytes, under the covers FileStream.ReadAsync will issue the
actual native call with its own much larger buffer, which by default is 4K. The first time you issue your
16-byte read, actual I/O will be required and the operation is likely to complete asynchronously. But
the next 255 calls you make could simply end up draining the remainder of the data read into that 4K
buffer, in which case 255 of the 256 “async” operations actually complete synchronously. If the
method returns a Task<int>, every one of those 255 synchronously-completing calls could still end
up allocating a Task<int>, just to hand back the int that’s already known. Various techniques were
devised to minimize this, e.g. if the int is one of a few well-known values (e.g. -1 through 8), then the
async method infrastructure will hand back a pre-allocated and cached Task<int> instance for that
value, and various stream implementations (including FileStream) would cache the previously-
returned Task<int> and hand it back for the next call as well if the next call yielded exactly the same
number of bytes. But those optimizations don’t fully mitigate the issue. Instead, we introduced the
ValueTask<TResult> struct and provided the necessary “builder” to allow async methods to return</p>
<p>179</p>
<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>them. ValueTask<TResult> was simply a discrimated union between a TResult and Task<TResult>. If
an async method completed asynchronously (or if it failed synchronously), well, it would simply
allocate the Task<TResult> as it otherwise would have and return that task wrapped in a
ValueTask<TResult>. But if the method actually completed synchronously and successfully, it would
create a ValueTask<TResult> that just wrapped the resulting TResult, which then eliminates all
allocation overhead for the synchronously-completing case. Yay, everyone’s happy. Well, almost
everyone. For really hot paths, especially those lower down in the stack that many other code paths
build on top of, it can also be beneficial to avoid the allocations even for the asynchronously
completing case. To address that, .NET Core 2.1 saw the introduction of the
IValueTaskSource<TResult> interface along with enabling ValueTask<TResult> to wrap an instance
of that interface in addition to a TResult or a Task<TResult> (at which point it also became
meaningful to introduce a non-generic ValueTask and the associated IValueTaskSource). Someone
can implement this interface with whatever behaviors they want, although we codified the typical
implementation of the core async logic into the ManualResetValueTaskSourceCore helper struct,
which is typically embedded into some object, with the interface methods delegating to
corresponding helpers on the struct. Why would someone want to do this? Most commonly, it’s to be
able to reuse the same instance implementing this interface over and over and over. So, for example,
Socket exposes a ValueTask<int> ReceiveAsync method, and it caches a single instance of an
IValueTaskSource<int> implementation for use with such receives. As long as you only ever have
one receive pending on a given socket at a time (which is the 99.999% case), every ReceiveAsync call
will either return a ValueTask<int> wrapped around an int value or a ValueTask<int> wrapped
around that reusable IValueTaskSource<int>, making all use of ReceiveAsync ammortized
allocation-free (there is another instance used for SendAsync, such that you can have a concurrent
read and write on the socket and still avoid allocations). However, implementing this support is still
non-trivial, and can be super hard when dealing with an operation that’s composed of multiple
suboperations, which is exactly where async/await shine. Thus, C# 10 added support for overriding
the default builder that’s used on an individual async method (e.g. such that someone could provide
their own builder for a ValueTask<int>-returning method instead of the one that allocates Task<int>
instances for asynchronous completion) and .NET 6 included the new
PoolingAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder and PoolingAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder&lt;&gt; types. With
those, an async method like:</p>
<p>public async ValueTask<int> ReadAsync(Memory<byte> buffer) { ... }</p>
<p>can be changed to be:</p>
<p>[AsyncMethodBuilder(typeof(PoolingAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder&lt;&gt;))]
public async ValueTask<int> ReadAsync(Memory<byte> buffer) { ... }</p>
<p>which will cause the C# compiler to emit the implementation of this method using
PoolingAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder<int> instead of the default
AsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder<int>. The implementation of
PoolingAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder<TResult> is true to its name; it employs pooling to avoid
most of the allocation asynchronous completion would otherwise experience (I say “most” because
the pooling by design tries to balance all the various costs involved and may still sometimes allocate),
and makes it easy for methods implemented with async/await to reap those benefits. So, if this was
all introduced in the last release, why am I talking about it now? Pooling isn’t free. There are various</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>tradeoffs involved in its usage, and while it can make microbenchmarks look really good, it can also
negatively impact real-world usage, e.g. by increasing the cost of garbage collections that do occur by
increasing the number of Gen2 to Gen0 references that exist. As such, while the functionality is
valuable, we’ve been methodical in where and how we use it, choosing to do so more slowly and only
employing it after sufficient analysis deems it’s worthwhile.</p>
<p>Such is the case with SslStream. With dotnet/runtime#69418, two core and hot async methods on
SslStream’s read path were annotated to use pooling. A microbenchmark shows what I mean when I
wrote this can make microbenchmarks look really good (focus on the allocation columns). This
benchmark is repeatedly issuing a read (that will be forced to complete asynchronously because
there’s no available data to satisfy it), then issuing a write to enable that read to complete, and then
awaiting the read’s completion; every read thus completes asynchronously.</p>

<p>One final change related to reading and writing performance on an SslStream. I find this one
particularly interesting, as it highlights a new and powerful C# 11 and .NET 7 feature: static abstract
members in interfaces. SslStream, as with every Stream, exposes both synchronous and asynchronous
methods for reading and writing. And as you may be aware, the code within SslStream for
implementing reads and writes is not particularly small. Thus, we really want to avoid having to
duplicate all of the code paths, once for synchronous work and once for asynchronous work, when in
reality the only place that bifurcation is needed is at the leaves where calls into the underlying Stream
are made to perform the actual I/O. Historically, we’ve had two different mechanisms we’ve employed
in dotnet/runtime for handling such unification. One is to make all methods async, but with an
additional bool useAsync parameter that gets fed through the call chain, then branching based on it
at the leaves, e.g.</p>
<p>public static void Work(Stream s) =&gt;
A(s, useAsyunc: false).GetAwaiter().GetResult(); // GetResult() to propagate any
exceptions</p>
<p>public static Task WorkAsync(Stream S) =&gt;
A(s, useAsync: true);</p>
<p>internal static async Task A(Stream s, bool useAsync)
{
...
await B(s, useAsync);
...
}</p>
<p>private static async Task B(Stream s, bool useAsync)
{
...
int bytesRead = useAsync ?
await s.ReadAsync(buffer) :
s.Read(buffer.Span);
...
}</p>
<p>This way most of the logic and code is shared, and when useAsync is false, everything completes
synchronously and so we don’t pay for allocation that might otherwise be associated with the async-
ness. The other approach is similar in spirit, but instead of a bool parameter, taking advantage of
generic specialization and interface-implementing structs. Consider an interface like:</p>
<p>interface IReader
{
ValueTask<int> ReadAsync(Stream s, Memory<byte> buffer);
}</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>We can then declare two implementations of this interface:</p>
<p>struct SyncReader : IReader
{
public ValueTask<int> ReadAsync(Stream s, Memory<byte> buffer) =&gt;
new ValueTask<int>(s.Read(buffer.Span));
}</p>
<p>struct AsyncReader : IReader
{
public ValueTask<int> ReadAsync(Stream s, Memory<byte> buffer) =&gt;
s.ReadAsync(buffer);
}</p>
<p>Then we can redeclare our earlier example as:</p>
<p>public static void Work(Stream s) =&gt;
A(stream, default(SyncReader)).GetAwaiter().GetResult(); // to propagate any exceptions</p>
<p>public static Task WorkAsync(Stream S) =&gt;
A(s, default(AsyncReader));</p>
<p>internal static async Task A<TReader>(Stream s, TReader reader) where TReader : IReader
{
...
await B(s, reader);
...
}</p>
<p>private static async Task B<TReader>(Stream s, TReader reader) where TReader : IReader
{
...
int bytesRead = await reader.ReadAsync(s, buffer);
...
}</p>
<p>Note that the generic constraint on the TReader parameter here allows the implementation to invoke
the interface methods, and passing the structs as a generic avoids boxing. One code path supporting
both sync and async implementations.</p>
<p>This latter generic approach is how SslStream has historically handled the unification of its sync and
async implementations. It gets better in .NET 7 with C# 11 now that we have static abstract methods
in interfaces. We can instead declare our interface as (note the static abstract addition):</p>
<p>interface IReader
{
static abstract ValueTask<int> ReadAsync(Stream s, Memory<byte> buffer);
}</p>
<p>our types as (note the static addition):</p>
<p>struct SyncReader : IReader
{
public static ValueTask<int> ReadAsync(Stream s, Memory<byte> buffer) =&gt;
new ValueTask<int>(s.Read(buffer.Span));
}</p>
<p>struct AsyncReader : IReader</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>{
public static ValueTask<int> ReadAsync(Stream s, Memory<byte> buffer) =&gt;
s.ReadAsync(buffer);
}</p>
<p>and our consuming methods as (note the removal of the parameter and the switch to calling static
methods on the type parameter):</p>
<p>public static void Work(Stream s) =&gt;
A<SyncReader>(stream).GetAwaiter().GetResult(); // to propagate any exceptions</p>
<p>public static Task WorkAsync(Stream S) =&gt;
A<AsyncReader>(s);</p>
<p>internal static async Task A<TReader>(Stream s) where TReader : IReader
{
...
await B<TReader>(s);
...
}</p>
<p>private static async Task B<TReader>(Stream s) where TReader : IReader
{
...
int bytesRead = await TReader.ReadAsync(s, buffer);
...
}</p>
<p>Not only is this cleaner, but from a performance perspective we no longer need to pass around the
dummy generic parameter, which is general goodness, but for an async method it’s particularly
beneficial because the state machine type ends up storing all parameters as fields, which means every
parameter can increase the amount of allocation incurred by an async method if the method ends up
completing asynchronously. dotnet/runtime#65239 flipped SslStream (and NegotiateStream) to
follow this approach. It’s also used in multiple other places now throughout dotnet/runtime.
dotnet/runtime#69278 from <a href="https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis">@teo-tsirpanis</a> changed the
RandomAccess class’ implementation for Windows and the ThreadPool’s mechanism for invoking work
items to use the same approach. Further, dotnet/runtime#63546 did the same in the Regex
implementation, and in particular in the new RegexOptions.NonBacktracking implementation, as a
way to abstract over DFA and NFA-based operations using the same code (this technique was since
further utilized in NonBacktracking, such as by dotnet/runtime#71234 from
<a href="https://github.com/olsaarik">@olsaarik</a>). And potentially most impactfully, dotnet/runtime#73768 did
so with IndexOfAny to abstract away the differences between IndexOfAny and IndexOfAnyExcept
(also for the Last variants). With the introduction of the {Last}IndexOfAnyExcept variations
previously mentioned, we now have four different variants of IndexOfAny with essentially the same
functionality: searching forward or backwards, and with equality or inequality. While more challenging
to try to unify the directional aspect, this PR utilized this same kind of generic specialization to hide
behind an interface the ability to negate the comparison; the core implementations of these methods
can then be implemented once and passed either a Negate or DontNegate implementation of the
interface. The net result is not only that the new Except varieties immediately gained all of the
optimizations of the non-Except varieties, but also the goal of trying to make everything consistent
resulted in finding places where we were missing optimization opportunities in existing methods
(gaps that the PR also rectified).</p>

<p>Let’s move up the stack to HTTP. Most of the folks focusing on networking in .NET 7 were focused on
taking the preview support for HTTP/3 that shipped in .NET 6 and making it a first-class supported
feature in .NET 7. That included functional improvements, reliability and correctness fixes, and
performance improvements, such that HTTP/3 can now be used via HttpClient on both Windows
and Linux (it depends on an underlying QUIC implementation in the msquic component, which isn’t
currently available for macOS). However, there were significant improvements throughout the HTTP
stack, beyond HTTP/3.</p>
<p>One aspect of HttpClient that cuts across all versions of HTTP is support for handling and
representing headers. While significant improvements went into previous releases to trim down the
size of the data structures used to store header information, further work on this front was done for
.NET 7. dotnet/runtime#62981, for example, improves the data structure used to store headers. One of
the things HttpHeaders needs to deal with is that there’s no defined limit to the number of headers
that can be sent with an HTTP request or response (though in order to mitigate possible denial of
service attacks, the implementation has a configurable limit for how many bytes of headers are
accepted from the server), and thus it needs to be able to handle an arbitrary number of them and to
do so with efficient access. As such, for the longest time HttpHeaders has used a Dictionary&lt;,&gt; to
provide O(1) lookup into these headers. However, while it’s valid to have large numbers of headers,
it’s most common to only have a handful, and for only a few items, the overheads involved in a hash
table like Dictionary&lt;&gt; can be more than just storing the elements in an array and doing an O(N)
lookup by doing a linear search through all the elements (algorithmic complexity ignores the
“constants” involved, so for a small N, an O(N) algorithm might be much faster and lighterweight than
an O(1)). This PR takes advantage of that and teaches HttpHeaders how to use either an array or a
dictionary; for common numbers of headers (the current threshold is 64), it just uses an array, and in
the rare case where that threshold is exceeded, it graduates into a dictionary. This reduces the
allocation in HttpHeader in all but the most niche cases while also making it faster for lookups.</p>
<p>Another header-related size reduction comes in dotnet/runtime#64105. The internal representation of
headers involves a HeaderDescriptor that enables “known headers” (headers defined in the HTTP
specifications or that we’re otherwise aware of and want to optimize) to share common data, e.g. if a
response header matches one of these known headers, we can just use the header name string
singleton rather than allocating a new string for that header each time we receive it. This
HeaderDescriptor accomodated both known headers and custom headers by having two fields, one
for known header data (which would be null for custom headers) and one for the header name.
Instead, this PR employs a relatively-common technique of having a single object field that then
stores either the known header information or the name, since the known header information itself
includes the name, and thus we don’t need the duplication. At the expense of a type check when we</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>need to look up information from that field, we cut the number of fields in half. And while this
HeaderDescriptor is itself a struct, it’s stored in header collections, and thus by cutting the size of the
HeaderDescriptor in half, we can significantly reduce the size of those collections, especially when
many custom headers are involved.</p>

<p>Similarly focused on allocation, dotnet/runtime#63057 removes two fields from the
HttpHeaderValueCollection<T> collection type, which provides the concrete implementation for
ICollection<T> properties like HttpContentHeaders.ContentEncoding,
HttpRequestHeaders.UserAgent, and HttpResponseHeaders.Server. The initial design and
implementation of this type were overly flexible, with a mechanism for custom validation of values,
which entailed multiple fields for storing things like an Action&lt;&gt; callback to use for validation. But as
it turns out in practice, that validation was only used for one specific consumer, and so rather than
making everyone pay for the extra space that wasn’t typically used, the validation was instead
extracted out to just the call sites it was required.</p>
<p>A more focused allocation reduction comes in dotnet/runtime#63641. The shared internal utility
method HttpRuleParser.GetHostLength was using string.Substring in order to hand back the
parsed host information, but only some of the callers needed this. Rather than making everyone pay
for something that not everyone needed, this logic was moved into only the call sites that needed it.</p>
<p>Other small allocation improvements were also made outside of headers. For example, when new
HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 connections are created, the implementation queues a work item to the thread
pool to handle the actual creation, primarily to escape locks that might be held higher in the call
stack. To do so, it used Task.Run. And while normally Task.Run is a fine thing to use, in this case there
were two issues: the resulting Task was being ignored, such that any unexpected exceptions would
just be eaten, and the lambda being passed to Task.Run was closing over this and a local, which
means the C# compiler will have generated code to allocate both a “display class” (an object to store
the state being passed in) for the closure and then also a delegate to a method on that display class.
Instead, dotnet/runtime#68750 switches it to use ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem, using the
overload that takes a generic TState, and passing in a tuple of all required state in order to avoid
both superfluous allocations.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 16 | Networking</p>
<p>Folks using HTTP often need to go through a proxy server, and in .NET the ability to go through an
HTTP proxy is represented via the IWebProxy interface; it has three members, GetProxy for getting the
Uri of the proxy to use for a given destination Uri, the IsBypassed method which says whether a
given Uri should go through a proxy or not, and then a Credentials property to be used when
accessing the target proxy. The canonical implementation of IWebProxy provided in the core libraries
is the aptly named WebProxy. WebProxy is fairly simple: you give it a proxy Uri, and then calls to
GetProxy return that proxy Uri if the destination isn’t to be bypassed. Whether a Uri should be
bypassed is determined by two things (assuming a non-null proxy Uri was provided): did the
constructor of the WebProxy specify that “local” destinations should be bypassed (and if so, is this
destination local), or does this destination address match any of any number of regular expressions
provided. As it turns out, this latter aspect has been relatively slow and allocation-heavy in all previous
releases of .NET, for two reasons: every call to check whether an address was bypassed was recreating
a Regex instance for every supplied regular expression, and every call to check whether an address
was bypassed was deriving a new string from the Uri to use to match against the Regex. In .NET 7,
both of those issues have been fixed, yielding significant improvements if you rely on this regular
expression functionality. dotnet/runtime#73803 from
<a href="https://github.com/onehourlate">@onehourlate</a> changed the handling of the collection of these
Regex instances. The problem was that WebProxy exposes an ArrayList (this type goes back to the
beginning of .NET and was created pre-generics), which the consumer could modify, and so WebProxy
had to assume the collection was modified between uses and addressed that by simply creating new
Regex instances on every use; not good. Instead, this PR creates a custom ArrayList-derived type
that can track all relevant mutations, and then only if the collection is changed (which is incredibly
rare, bordering on never) do the Regex instances need to be recreated. And dotnet/runtime#73807
takes advantage of stack allocation and the MemoryExtensions.TryWrite method with string
interpolation to format the text into stack memory, avoiding the string allocation. This, combined with
the new Regex.IsMatch(ReadOnlySpan<char>) overload that enables us to match against that
stackalloc’d span, makes that aspect of the operation allocation-free as well. Altogether, drastic
improvements:</p>

<p>Also related to HTTP, WebUtility’s HtmlDecode method has improved for .NET 7. The implementation
had been manually iterating through each character in the input looking for a '&amp;' to be unescaped.
Any time you see such an open-coded loop looking for one or more specific characters, it’s a red flag
that IndexOf should be strongly considered. dotnet/runtime#70700 deletes the entire searching
function and replaces it with IndexOf, yielding simpler and much faster code (you can see other
improvements to use IndexOf variants in networking, such as dotnet/runtime#71137, which used</p>

<p>There have been a myriad of other performance-related improvements in networking as well, such as
dotnet/runtime#67881 which removed the use of TcpClient from FtpWebRequest;
dotnet/runtime#68745 in WebSocket which removed a parameter from one of the core async methods
(and since parameters end up on the state machine, if the async method yields this results in fewer
allocated bytes); and dotnet/runtime#70866 and dotnet/runtime#70900, which replaced all remaining
use of Marshal.PtrToStructure in the core networking code with more efficient marshaling (e.g. just
performing casts). While Marshal.PtrToStructure is valuable when custom marshaling directives are
used and the runtime needs to be involved in the conversion, it’s also much more heavyweight than
just casting, which can be done when the native and managed layouts are bit-for-bit compatible. As
with the u8 example earlier, this comparison is hardly fair, but that’s exactly the point:</p>

<p>JSON</p>
<p>System.Text.Json was introduced in .NET Core 3.0, and has seen a significant amount of investment
in each release since. .NET 7 is no exception. New features in .NET 7 include support for customizing
contracts, polymorphic serialization, support for required members, support for DateOnly / TimeOnly,
support for IAsyncEnumerable<T> and JsonDocument in source generation, and support for
configuring MaxDepth in JsonWriterOptions. However, there have also been new features specifically
focused on performance, and other changes about improving performance of JSON handling in a
variety of scenarios.</p>
<p>One of the biggest performance pitfalls we’ve seen developers face with System.Text.Json has to do
with how the library caches data. In order to achieve good serialization and deserialization
performance when the source generator isn’t used, System.Text.Json uses reflection emit to
generate custom code for reading/writing members of the types being processed. Instead of then
having to pay reflection invoke costs on every access, the library incurs a much larger one-time cost
per type to perform this code generation, but then all subsequent handling of these types is very
fast… assuming the generated code is available for use. These generated handlers need to be stored
somewhere, and the location that’s used for storing them is them is JsonSerializerOptions. The
idea was intended to be that developers would instantiate an options instance once and pass it
around to all of their serialization/deserialization calls; thus, state like these generated handlers could
be cached on them. And that works well when developers follow the recommended model. But when
they don’t, performance falls off a cliff, and hard. Instead of “just” paying for the reflection invoke
costs, each use of a new JsonSerializerOptions ends up re-generating via reflection emit those
handlers, skyrocketing the cost of serialization and deserialization. A super simple benchmark makes
this obvious:</p>
<p>private JsonSerializerOptions _options = new JsonSerializerOptions();
private MyAmazingClass _instance = new MyAmazingClass();</p>
<p>[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]

<p>In .NET 7, this was fixed in dotnet/runtime#64646 (and subsequently tweaked in
dotnet/runtime#66248) by adding a global cache of the type information separate from the options
instances. A JsonSerializerOptions still has a cache, but when new handlers are generated via
reflection emit, those are also cached at the global level (with appropriate removal when no longer
used in order to avoid unbounded leaks).</p>

<p>As can be seen here, it’s still more expensive to create a new JsonSerializerOptions instance on
each call, and the recommended approach is “don’t do that.” But if someone does do it, in this
example they’re only paying 3.6x the cost rather than 621x the cost, a huge improvement.
dotnet/runtime#61434 also now exposes the JsonSerializerOptions.Default instance that’s used
by default if no options are explicitly provided.</p>
<p>Another change to JsonSerializer came in dotnet/runtime#72510, which slightly improved the
performance of serialization when using the source generator. The source generator emits helpers for
performing the serialization/deserialization work, and these are then invoked by JsonSerializer via
delegates (as part of abstracting away all the different implementation strategies for how to get and
set members on the types being serialized and deserialized). Previously, these helpers were being
emitted as static methods, which in turn meant that the delegates were being created to static
methods. Delegates to instance methods are a bit faster to invoke than delegates to static methods,
so this PR made a simple few-line change for the source generator to emit these as instance methods
instead.</p>
<p>Yet another for JsonSerializer comes in dotnet/runtime#73338, which improves allocation with how
it utilizes Utf8JsonWriter. Utf8JsonWriter is a class, and every time JsonSerializer would write
out JSON, it would allocate a new Utf8JsonWriter instance. In turn, Utf8JsonWriter needs
something to write to, and although the serializer was using an IBufferWriter implementation that
pooled the underlying byte[] instances employed, the implementation of IBufferWriter itself is a
class that JsonSerializer would allocate. A typical Serialize call would then end up allocating a
few extra objects and an extra couple of hundred bytes just for these helper data structures. To
address that, this PR takes advantage of [ThreadStatic], which can be put onto static fields to make
them per-thread rather than per-process. From whatever thread is performing the (synchronous)</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>CHAPTER 17 | JSON</p>
<p>Serialize operation, it then ensures the current thread has a Utf8JsonWriter and IBufferWriter
instance it can use, and uses them; for the most part this is straightforward, but it needs to ensure that
the serialization operation itself doesn’t try to recursively serialize, in which case these objects could
end up being used erroneously while already in use. It also needs to make sure that the pooled
IBufferWriter doesn’t hold on to any of its byte[]s while it’s not being used. That instance gets its
arrays from ArrayPool<T>, and we want those arrays to be usable in the meantime by anyone else
making use of the pool, not sequestered off in this cached IBufferWriter implementation. This
optimization is also only really meaningful for small object graphs being serialized, and only applies to
the synchronous operations (asynchronous operations would require a more complicated pooling
mechanism, since the operation isn’t tied to a specific thread, and the overhead of such complication
would likely outweigh the modest gain this optimization provides).</p>

<p>Utf8JsonWriter and Utf8JsonReader also saw several improvements directly. dotnet/runtime#69580
adds a few new performance-focused members, the ValueIsEscaped property (which exposes already
tracked information and enables consumers to avoid the expense of re-checking) and the CopyString
method (which provides a non-allocating mechanism to get access to a string value from the reader).
It then also uses the added support internally to speed up certain operations on Utf8JsonReader. And
dotnet/runtime#63863, dotnet/runtime#71534, and dotnet/runtime#61746 fix how some exception
checks and throws were being handled so as to not slow down the non-exceptional fast paths.</p>

<p>XML</p>
<p>System.Xml is used by a huge number of applications and services, but ever since JSON hit the scene
and has been all the rage, XML has taken a back seat and thus hasn’t seen a lot of investment from
either a functionality or performance perspective. Thankfully, System.Xml gets a bit of performance
love in .NET 7, in particular around reducing allocation on some commonly used code paths.</p>
<p>Sometimes a performance fix is as easy as changing a single number. That’s the case with
dotnet/runtime#63459 from <a href="https://github.com/chrisdcmoore">@chrisdcmoore</a>, which addresses a
long-standing issue with the asynchronous methods on the popular XmlReader. When XmlReader was
originally written, whoever developed it chose a fairly common buffer size to be used for read
operations, namely 4K or 8K chars depending on various conditions. When XmlReader later gained
asynchronous reading functionality, for whatever reason a much, much larger buffer size of 64K chars
was selected (presumably in hopes of minimizing the number of asynchronous operations that would
need to be employed, but the actual rationale is lost to history). A key problem with such a buffer size,
beyond it leading to a lot of allocation, is the allocation it produces typically ends up on the Large
Object Heap (LOH). By default, under the expectation that really large objects are long-lived, objects
greater than 85K bytes are allocated into the LOH, which is treated as part of Gen 2, and that makes
such allocation if not long-lived even more expensive in terms of overall impact on the system. Well,
64K chars is 128K bytes, which puts it squarely above that threshold. This PR lowers the size from 64K
chars to 32K chars, putting it below the threshold (and generally reducing allocation pressure, how
much memory needs to be zero’d, etc). While it’s still a very large allocation, and in the future we
could look at pooling the buffer or employing a smaller one (e.g. no different from what’s done for
the synchronous APIs), this simple one-number change alone makes a substantial difference for
shorter input documents (while not perceivably negatively impacting larger ones).</p>

<p>XmlReader and XmlWriter saw other allocation-related improvements as well. dotnet/runtime#60076
from <a href="https://github.com/kronic">@kronic</a> improved the ReadOnlyTernaryTree internal type that’s
used when XmlOutputMethod.Html is specified in the XmlWriterSettings. This included using a
ReadOnlySpan<byte> initialized from an RVA static instead of a large byte[] array that would need to
be allocated. And dotnet/runtime#60057 from <a href="https://github.com/kronic">@kronic</a>, which converted
~400 string creations in the System.Private.Xml assembly to use interpolated strings. Many of
these cases were stylistic, converting something like string1 + &quot;:&quot; + string2 into
$&quot;{string1}:{string2}&quot;; I say stylistic here because the C# compiler will generate the exact same
code for both of those, a call to string.Concat(string1, &quot;:&quot;, string2), given that there’s a
Concat overload that accepts three strings. However, some of the changes do impact allocation. For
example, the private XmlTextWriter.GeneratePrefix method had the code:</p>
<p>return &quot;d&quot; + _top.ToString(&quot;d&quot;, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)
+ &quot;p&quot; + temp.ToString(&quot;d&quot;, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);</p>
<p>where _top and temp are both ints. This will result in allocating two temporary strings and then
concatenating those with the two constant strings. Instead, the PR changed it to:</p>
<p>return string.Create(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, $&quot;d{_top:d}p{temp:d}&quot;);</p>
<p>which while shorter is also more efficient, avoiding the intermediate string allocations, as the custom
interpolated string handler used by string.Create will format those into a pooled buffer rather than
allocating intermediate temporaries.</p>
<p>XmlSerializer is also quite popular and also gets a (small) allocation reduction, in particular for
deserialization. XmlSerializer has two modes for generating serialization/deserialization routines:
using reflection emit to dynamically generate IL at run-time that are tuned to the specific shape of the
types being serialized/deserialized, and the XML Serializer Generator Tool (sgen), which generates a
.dll containing the same support, just ahead-of-time (a sort-of precursor to the Roslyn source</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>CHAPTER 18 | XML</p>
<p>generators we love today). In both cases, when deserializing, the generated code wants to track which
properties of the object being deserialized have already been set, and to do that, it uses a bool[] as a
bit array. Every time an object is deserialized, it allocates a bool[] with enough elements to track
every member of the type. But in common usage, the vast majority of types being deserialized only
have a relatively small number of properties, which means we can easily use stack memory to track
this information rather than heap memory. That’s what dotnet/runtime#66914 does. It updates both
of the code generators to stackalloc into a Span<bool> for less than or equal to 32 values, and
otherwise fall back to the old approach of heap-allocating the bool[] (which can also then be stored
into a Span<bool> so that the subsequent code paths simply use a span instead of an array). You can
see this quite easily in the .NET Object Allocation Tracking tool in Visual Studio. For this console app
(which, as an aside, shows how lovely the new raw string literals feature in C# is for working with
XML):</p>

<p>Here’s what I see when I run this under .NET 6:</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>CHAPTER 18 | XML</p>
<p>We’re running a thousand deserializations, each of which will deserialize 10 Release instances, and so
we expect to see 10,000 Release objects being allocated, which we do… but we also see 10,000
bool[] being allocated. Now with .NET 7 (note the distinct lack of the per-object bool[]):</p>
<p>Other allocation reduction went into the creation of the serializer/deserializer itself, such as with
dotnet/runtime#68738 avoiding allocating strings to escape text that didn’t actually need escaping,
dotnet/runtime#66915 using stack allocation for building up small text instead of using a
StringBuilder, dotnet/runtime#66797 avoiding delegate and closure allocations in accessing the
cache of serializers previously created, dotnet/runtime#67001 from
<a href="https://github.com/TrayanZapryanov">@TrayanZapryanov</a> caching an array used with string.Split,
and dotnet/runtime#67002 from <a href="https://github.com/TrayanZapryanov">@TrayanZapryanov</a> that
changed some parsing code to avoid a string.ToCharArray invocation.</p>
<p>For folks using XML schema, dotnet/runtime#66908 replaces some Hashtables in the implementation
where those collections were storing ints as the value. Given that Hashtable is a non-generic
collection, every one of those ints was getting boxed, resulting in unnecessary allocation overhead;
these were fixed by replacing these Hashtables with Dictionary&lt;..., int&gt; instances. (As an aside,
this is a fairly common performance-focused replacement to do, but you need to be careful as
Hashtable has a few behavioral differences from Dictionary&lt;,&gt;; beyond the obvious difference of
Hashtable returning null from its indexer when a key isn’t found and Dictionary&lt;,&gt; throwing in
that same condition, Hashtable is thread-safe for use with not only multiple readers but multiple
readers concurrent with a single writer, and Dictionary&lt;,&gt; is not.) dotnet/runtime#67045 reduces
allocation of XmlQualifiedName instances in the implementation of XsdBuilder.ProcessElement and
XsdBuilder.ProcessAttribute. And dotnet/runtime#64868 from
<a href="https://github.com/TrayanZapryanov">@TrayanZapryanov</a> uses stack-based memory and pooling to</p>
<p>196</p>

System.Diagnostics.Trace type isn’t the recommended tracing mechanism for new code, it’s widely
used in existing applications, and XmlWriterTraceListener let’s you plug in to that mechanism to
write out XML logs for traced information. dotnet/runtime#66762 avoids a bunch of string allocation
occurring as part of this tracing, by formatting much of the header information into a span and then
writing that out rather than ToString()’ing each individual piece of data.</p>

<p>Cryptography</p>
<p>Some fairly significant new features came to System.Security.Cryptography in .NET 7, including the
support necessary to enable the previously discussed OCSP stapling and support for building
certificate revocation lists, but there was also a fair amount of effort put into making existing support
faster and more lightweight.</p>
<p>One fairly substantial change in .NET 7 is split across dotnet/runtime#61025, dotnet/runtime#61137,
and dotnet/runtime#64307. These PRs don’t change any code materially, but instead consolidate all of
the various cryptography-related assemblies in the core libraries into a single
System.Security.Cryptography assembly. When .NET Core was first envisioned, a goal was to make
it extremely modular, and large swaths of code were teased apart to create many smaller assemblies.
For example, cryptographic functionality was split between
System.Security.Cryptography.Algorithms.dll, System.Security.Cryptography.Cng.dll,
System.Security.Cryptography.Csp.dll, System.Security.Cryptography.Encoding.dll,
System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl.dll, System.Security.Cryptography.Primitives.dll,
and System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.dll. You can see this if you look in your
shared framework folder for a previous release, e.g. here’s mine for .NET 6:</p>
<p>These PRs move all of that code into a single System.Security.Cryptography.dll assembly. This has
several benefits. First, crypto is used in a huge number of applications, and most apps would end up</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>CHAPTER 19 | Cryptography</p>
<p>requiring multiple (or even most) of these assemblies. Every assembly that’s loaded adds overhead.
Second, a variety of helper files had to be compiled into each assembly, leading to overall larger
amount of compiled code to be distributed. And third, we weren’t able to implement everything as
optimal as we’d have otherwise liked due to functionality in one assembly not exposed to another
(and we avoid using InternalsVisibleTo as it hampers maintainability and impedes other analysis
and optimizations). Now in .NET 7, the shared framework looks more like this:</p>
<p>Interesting, you still see a bunch of assemblies there, but all except for
System.Security.Cryptography.dll are tiny; that’s because these are simple facades. Because we
need to support binaries built for .NET 6 and earlier running on .NET 7, we need to be able to handle
binaries that refer to types in these assemblies, but in .NET 7, those types actually live in
System.Security.Cryptography.dll. .NET provides a solution for this in the form of the
[TypeForwardedTo(...)] attribute, which enables one assembly to say “hey, if you’re looking for type
X, it now lives over there.” And if you crack open one of these assemblies in a tool like ILSpy, you can
see they’re essentially empty except for a bunch of these attributes:</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>CHAPTER 19 | Cryptography</p>
<p>In addition to the startup and maintenance wins this provides, this has also enabled further
subsequent optimization. For example, there’s a lot of object cloning that goes on in the innards of
this library. Various objects are used to wrap native handles to OS cryptographic resources, and to
handle lifetime semantics and ownership appropriately, there are many cases where a native handle is
duplicated and then wrapped in one or more new managed objects. In some cases, however, the
original resource is then destroyed because it’s no longer needed, and the whole operation could
have been made more efficient if the original resource just had its ownership transferred to the new
objects rather than being duplicated and destroyed. This kind of ownership transfer typically is hard to
do between assemblies as it generally requires public API that’s not focused on such usage patterns,
but with internals access, this can be overcome. dotnet/runtime#72120 does this, for example, to
reduce allocation of various resources inside the RSACng, DSACng, ECDsaCng, and ECDiffieHellmanCng
public types.</p>
<p>In terms of actual code improvements, there are many. One category of improvements is around
“one-shot” operations. With many forms of data processing, all of the data needn’t be processed in
one operation. A block of data can be processed, then another, then another, until finally there’s no
more data to be processed. In such usage, there’s often some kind of state carried over from the
processing of one block to the processing of the next, and then the processing of the last block is
special as it needn’t carry over anything and instead needs to perform whatever work is required to
end the whole operation, e.g. outputting any final footer or checksum that might be required as part
of the format. Thus, APIs that are able to handle arbitrary number of blocks of data are often a bit
more expensive in one way, shape, or form than APIs that only support a single input; this latter
category is known as “one shot” operations, because they do everything in “one shot.” In some cases,
one-shot operations can be significantly cheaper, and in other cases they merely avoid some
allocations that would have been necessary to transfer state from the processing of one block of data
to the next. dotnet/runtime#58270 from <a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a> and
dotnet/runtime#65725 from <a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a> both improved the
performance of various one-shot operations on “symmetric” cryptograhic algorithms (algorithms that
use the same key information to both encrypt and decrypt), like AES. The former does so by
refactoring the implementations to avoid some reset work that’s not necessary in the case of one-
shots because the relevant state is about to go away, anyway, and that in turns also allows the
implementation to store less of certain kinds of state. The latter does so for decryption one-shots by
decrypting directly into the destination buffer whenever possible, using stack space if possible when
going directly into the user’s buffer isn’t feasible, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to making one-shots lighterweight, other PRs have then used these one-shot operations in
more places in order to simplify their code and benefit from the increased performance, e.g.
dotnet/runtime#70639 from <a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, dotnet/runtime#70857 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, dotnet/runtime#64005 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, and dotnet/runtime#64174 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>.</p>
<p>There’s also a large number of PRs that have focused on removing allocations from around the crypto
stack:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Stack allocation. As has been seen in many other PRs referenced throughout this post, using
stackalloc is a very effective way to get rid of array allocations in many situations. It’s used
effectively in multiple crypto PRs to avoid either temporary or pooled array allocations, such as
in dotnet/runtime#64584 from <a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, dotnet/runtime#69831
from <a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, dotnet/runtime#70173 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, dotnet/runtime#69812 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, and dotnet/runtime#69448 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>. Sometimes this is used when calling an API that has
multiple overloads, including one taking an array and one taking a span. Othertimes it’s used
with P/Invokes that often just pass out a small amount of data. Sometimes it’s used to avoid
temporary array allocations, and sometimes it’s used in places where pooling was used
previously, but the data is often small enough to avoid even the overheads of pooling.</p>
<p>Avoiding double copies. Most of the crypto APIs that accept byte[]s and store them end up
making defensive copies of those arrays rather than storing the original. This is fairly common
throughout .NET, but it’s especially common in the crypto stack, where the ability to trust the
data is as you expect it (and validate it) is paramount. In some cases, though, code ends up
allocating a temporary byte[] just to pass data into one of these APIs that copies and re-
allocates, anyway. dotnet/runtime#71102 from <a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>,
dotnet/runtime#69024 from <a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, dotnet/runtime#71015
from <a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, and dotnet/runtime#69534 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a> deal with that duplication in some cases by extracting
a span to the original data instead of creating a temporary byte[]; when that span is passed into
the target API, the target API still makes a copy, but we’ve avoided the first one and thus cut the
array allocation for these operations effectively in half. dotnet/runtime#71888 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a> is a variation on this theme, improving the internals of</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>CHAPTER 19 | Cryptography</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Rfc2898DeriveBytes to supports spans such that its constructors that accept spans can then do
the more efficient thing.</p>
<p>Replacing O(1) data structures. O(1) lookup data structures like Dictionary&lt;,&gt; and
HashSet&lt;&gt; are the lifeblood of most applications and services, but sometimes algorithmic
complexity is misleading. Yes, these provide very efficient searching, but there’s still overhead
associated with computing a hash code, mapping that hash code to a location in the data
structure, and so on. If there’s only ever a handful of items (i.e. the N in the complexity is really,
really small), it can be much faster to just do a linear search, and if N is sufficiently small, a data
structure may not even be needed at all: the search can just be open-coded as a waterfall of
if/elseif/else constructs. That’s the case in a PR like dotnet/runtime#71341 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, where the 99.999% case involves just five strings
(names of hash algorithms); it’s cheaper to just compare against each than it is do a
HashSet&lt;&gt;.Contains, especially since the JIT now unrolls and vectorizes the comparison against
the constant string names.</p>
<p>Simply avoiding unnecessary work. The best optimizations are ones where you simply stop
doing work you don’t have to do. dotnet/runtime#68553 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a> is a good example of this. This code was performing a
hash of some data in order to determine the length of resulting hashes for that particular
configuration, but we actually know ahead of time exactly how long a hash for a given algorithm
is going to be, and we already have in this code a cascading if/elseif/else that’s checking for each
known algorithm, so we can instead just hardcode the length for each. dotnet/runtime#70589
from <a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a> is another good example, in the same spirit of
the ownership transfer example mentioned earlier (but this one didn’t previously span assembly
boundaries). Rather than in several places taking an X509Extension, serializing it to a byte[],
and passing that temporary byte[] to something else that in turn makes a defensive copy, we
can instead provide an internal pathway for ownership transfer, bypassing all of the middle
stages. Another good one is dotnet/runtime#70618 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, as it’s an example of how it pays to really understand
your dependencies. The implementation of symmetric encryption on macOS uses the
CommonCrypto library. One of the functions it exposes is CCCryptorFinal, which is used at the
end of the encryption/decryption process. However, there are several cases called out in the
docs where it’s unnecessary (“superfluous,” according to the docs), and so our dutifully calling it
even in those situations is wasteful. The fix? Stop doing unnecessary work.</p>
<p>New APIs. A bunch of new APIs were introduced for cryptography in .NET 7. Most are focused
on easing scenarios that were difficult to do correctly before, like dotnet/runtime#66509 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a> that provides an X500DistinguishedNameBuilder. But
some are focused squarely on performance. dotnet/runtime#57835 from
<a href="https://github.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>, for example, exposes a new RawDataMemory property
on X509Certificate2. Whereas the existing RawData property returns a new byte[] on every
call (again a defensive copy to avoid having to deal with the possiblity that the consumer
mucked with the raw data), this new RawDataMemory returns a ReadOnlyMemory<byte> around
the internal byte[]. Since the only way to access and mutate that underlying byte[] via a
ReadOnlyMemory<byte> is via unsafe interop code (namely via the
System.Runtime.InteropServices.MemoryMarshal type), it doesn’t create a defensive copy and
enables accessing this data freely without additional allocation.</p>

<p>CHAPTER  20</p>
<p>Diagnostics</p>
<p>Let’s turn our attention to System.Diagnostics, which encompasses types ranging from process
management to tracing.</p>
<p>The Process class is used for a variety of purposes, including querying information about running
processes, interacting with other processes (e.g. being notified of their exiting), and launching
processes. The performance of querying for information in particular had some notable improvements
in .NET 7. Process provides several APIs for querying for process information, one of the most
common being Process.GetProcessesByName: apps that know the name of the process they’re
interested in can pass that to GetProcessesByName and get back a Process[] containing a Process
for each. It turns out that previous releases of .NET were loading the full information (e.g. all of its
threads) about every Process on the machine in order to filter down to just those with the target
name. dotnet/runtime#68705 fixes that by only loading the name for a process rather than all of the
information for it. While this helps a bit with throughput, it helps a ton with allocation:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public void GetProcessesByName()
{
foreach (Process p in Process.GetProcessesByName(&quot;dotnet.exe&quot;))
p.Dispose();

<p>2.14 KB</p>
<p>1.000</p>
<p>0.005</p>
<p>Accessing various pieces of information from a Process has also improved. If you load a Process
object via the Process.GetProcesses or Process.GetProcessesByName methods, by design they load
all information about the Process being retrieved; internally their state will be populated such that
subsequent accesses to members of the Process instance will be very fast. But, if you access a
Process via Process.GetProcessById or Process.GetCurrentProcess (which is effectively
GetProcessById for the current process’ id), no information other than the process’ ID is
prepopulated, and the state for the Process instance is queried on-demand. In most cases, accessing
a single member of one of those lazy-loaded Process instances triggers loading all of the data for it,
as the information is all available as part of the same native operation, e.g. on Windows using
NtQuerySystemInformation and on Linux reading from /proc/pid/stat and /proc/pid/status. But
in some cases we can be more fine-grained about it, using APIs that serve up a subset of the data
much more quickly. dotnet/runtime#59672 from <a href="https://github.com/SteveDunn">@SteveDunn</a>
provides one such optimization, using the QueryFullProcessImageName on Windows to read the
process name in response to Process.ProcessName being used. If all you care about reading is the</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>CHAPTER 20 | Diagnostics</p>
<p>process’ name, it’s a huge boost in throughput, and even if you subsequently go on to read additional
state from the Process and force it to load everything else, accessing the process name is so fast that
it doesn’t add meaningful overhead to the all-up operation. This is visible in this benchmark:</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public string GetCurrentProcessName()
{
using Process current = Process.GetCurrentProcess();
return current.ProcessName;

<p>Interestingly, this PR had a small deficiency we didn’t initially catch, which is that the
QueryFullProcessImageName API we switched to didn’t work in the case of elevated/privileged
processes. To accomodate those, dotnet/runtime#70073 from
<a href="https://github.com/schuettecarsten">@schuettecarsten</a> updated the code to keep both the new and
old implementations, starting with the new one and then only falling back to the old if operating on
an incompatible process.</p>
<p>Several additional PRs helped out the Process class. When launching processes with Process.Start
on Unix, the implementation was using Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes as part of argument handling,
resulting in a temporary array being allocated per argument; dotnet/runtime#71279 removes that
per-argument allocation, instead using Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCount to determine how large a
space is needed and then using the Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes overload that accepts a span to encode
directly into the native memory already being allocated. dotnet/runtime#71136 simplifies and
streamlines the code involved in getting the “short name” of a process on Windows for use in
comparing process names. And dotnet/runtime#45690 replaces a custom cache with use of
ArrayPool in the Windows implementation of getting all process information, enabling effective reuse
of the array that ends up being used rather than having it sequestered off in the Process
implementation forever.</p>
<p>Another area of performance investment has been in DiagnosticSource, and in particular around
enumerating through data from Activity instances. This work translates into faster integration and
interoperability via OpenTelemetry, in order to be able to export data from .NET Activity information
faster. dotnet/runtime#67012 from <a href="https://github.com/CodeBlanch">@CodeBlanch</a>, for example,
improved the performance of the internal DiagLinkedList<T>.DiagEnumerator type that’s the</p>

<p>Of course, when it comes to diagnostics, anyone who’s ever done anything with regards to timing and
measurements is likely familiar with good ol’ Stopwatch. Stopwatch is a simple type that’s very handy
for getting precise measurements and is thus used all over the place. But for folks that are really cost-
sensitive, the fact that Stopwatch is a class can be prohibitive, e.g. writing:</p>
<p>Stopwatch sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
...;
TimeSpan elapsed = sw.Elapsed;</p>
<p>is easy, but allocates a new object just to measure. To address this, Stopwatch has for years exposed
the static GetTimestamp() method which avoids that allocation, but consuming and translating the
resulting long value is complicated, requiring a formula involving using Stopwatch.Frequency and
TimeSpan.TicksPerSecond in the right incantation. To make this pattern easy, dotnet/runtime#66372
adds a static GetElapsedTime method that handles that conversion, such that someone who wants
that last mile of performance can write:</p>
<p>long timestamp = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();
...
TimeSpan elapsed = Stopwatch.GetElapsedTime(timestamp);</p>
<p>which avoids the allocation and saves a few cycles:</p>

<p>Exceptions</p>
<p>It might be odd to see the subject of “exceptions” in a post on performance improvements. After all,
exceptions are by their very nature meant to be “exceptional” (in the “rare” sense), and thus wouldn’t
typically contribute to fast-path performance. Which is a good thing, because fast-paths that throw
exceptions in the common case are no longer fast: throwing exceptions is quite expensive.</p>
<p>Instead, one of the things we do concern ourselves with is how to minimize the impact of checking for
exceptional conditions: the actual exception throwing may be unexpected and slow, but it’s super
common to need to check for those unexpected conditions, and that checking should be very fast. We
also want such checking to minimally impact binary size, especially if we’re going to have many such
checks all over the place, in generic code for which we end up with many copies due to generic
specialization, in functions that might be inlined, and so on. Further, we don’t want such checks to
impede other optimizations; for example, if I have a small function that wants to do some argument
validation and would otherwise be inlineable, I likely don’t want the presence of exception throwing to
invalidate the possibility of inlining.</p>
<p>Because of all of that, high-performance libraries often come up with custom “throw helpers” they use
to achieve their goals. There are a variety of patterns for this. Sometimes a library will just define its
own static method that handles constructing and throwing an exception, and then call sites do the
condition check and delegate to the method if throwing is needed:</p>
<p>if (arg is null)
ThrowArgumentNullException(nameof(arg));
...
[DoesNotReturn]
private static void ThrowArgumentNullException(string arg) =&gt;
throw new ArgumentNullException(arg);</p>
<p>This keeps the IL associated with the throwing out of the calling function, minimizing the impact of
the throw. That’s particularly valuable when additional work is needed to construct the exception, e.g.</p>
<p>private static void ThrowArgumentNullException(string arg) =&gt;
throw new ArgumentNullException(arg, SR.SomeResourceMessage);</p>
<p>Other times, libraries will encapsulate both the checking and throwing. This is exactly what the
ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull method that was added in .NET 6 does:</p>
<p>public static void ThrowIfNull([NotNull] object? argument,
[CallerArgumentExpression(&quot;argument&quot;)] string? paramName = null)
{
if (argument is null)
Throw(paramName);
}</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>CHAPTER 21 | Exceptions</p>
<p>[DoesNotReturn]
internal static void Throw(string? paramName) =&gt; throw new
ArgumentNullException(paramName);</p>
<p>With that, callers benefit from the concise call site:</p>
<p>public void M(string arg)
{
ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(arg);
...
}</p>
<p>the IL remains concise, and the assembly generated for the JIT will include the streamlined condition
check from the inlined ThrowIfNull but won’t inline the Throw helper, resulting in effectively the same
code as if you’d written the previously shown manual version with ThrowArgumentNullException
yourself. Nice.</p>
<p>Whenever we introduce new public APIs in .NET, I’m particularly keen on seeing them used as widely
as possible. Doing so serves multiple purposes, including helping to validate that the new API is
usable and fully addresses the intended scenarios, and including the rest of the codebase benefiting
from whatever that API is meant to provide, whether it be a performance improvement or just a
reduction in routinely written code. In the case of ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull, however, I
purposefully put on the brakes. We used it in .NET 6 in several dozen call sites, but primarily just in
place of custom ThrowIfNull-like helpers that had sprung up in various libraries around the runtime,
effectively deduplicating them. What we didn’t do, however, was replace the literally thousands of null
checks we have with calls to ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull. Why? Because the new !! C#
feature was right around the corner, destined for C# 11.</p>
<p>For those unaware, the !! feature enabled putting !! onto parameter names in member signatures,
e.g.</p>
<p>public void Process(string name!!)
{
...
}</p>
<p>The C# compiler then compiled that as equivalent to:</p>
<p>public void Process(string name)
{
ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(name);
}</p>
<p>(albeit using its own ThrowIfNull helper injected as internal into the assembly). Armed with the new
feature, dotnet/runtime#64720 and dotnet/runtime#65108 rolled out use of !! across
dotnet/runtime, replacing ~25,000 lines of code with ~5000 lines that used !!. But, what’s the line
from Kung Fu Panda, “One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it”? The presence of
that initial PR kicked off an unprecedented debate about the !! feature, with many folks liking the
concept but a myriad of different opinions about exactly how it should be exposed, and in the end,
the only common ground was to cut the feature. In response, dotnet/runtime#68178 undid all usage
of !!, replacing most of it with ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull. There are now ~5000 uses of
ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull across dotnet/runtime, making it one of our most popular</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>CHAPTER 21 | Exceptions</p>
<p>APIs internally. Interestingly, while we expected a peanut-buttery effect of slight perf improvements in
many places, our performance auto-analysis system flagged several performance improvements (e.g.
dotnet/perf-autofiling-issues#3531) as stemming from these changes, in particular because it enabled
the JIT’s inlining heuristics to flag more methods for inlining.</p>
<p>With the success of ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull and along with its significant roll-out in
.NET 7, .NET 7 also sees the introduction of several more such throw helpers. dotnet/runtime#61633,
for example, adds an overload of ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull that works with pointers.
dotnet/runtime#64357 adds the new ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty helper as well as
using it in several hundred places. And dotnet/runtime#58684 from
<a href="https://github.com/Bibletoon">@Bibletoon</a> adds the new ObjectDisposedException.ThrowIf helper
(tweaked by dotnet/runtime#71544 to help ensure it’s inlineable), which is then used at over a
hundred additional call sites by dotnet/runtime#71546.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 21 | Exceptions</p>
<p>CHAPTER  22</p>
<p>Registry</p>
<p>On Windows, the Registry is a database provided by the OS for applications and the system itself to
load and store configuration settings. Practically every application accesses the registry. I just tried a
simple console app:</p>
<p>Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, world&quot;);</p>
<p>built it as release, and then ran the resulting .exe. That execution alone triggered 64 RegQueryValue
operations (as visible via SysInternals’ Process Monitor tool). The core .NET libraries even access the
registry for a variety of purposes, such as for gathering data for TimeZoneInfo, gathering data for
various calendars like HijriCalendar and JapaneseCalendar, or for serving up environment variables
as part of Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(EnvironmentVariableTarget) with
EnvironmentVariableTarget.User or EnvironmentVariableTarget.Machine.</p>
<p>It’s thus beneficial to streamline access to registry data on Windows, in particular for reducing
overheads in startup paths where the registry is frequently accessed. dotnet/runtime#66918 does just
that. Previously, calling RegistryKey.GetValue would make a call to RegQueryValueEx with a null
buffer; this tells the RegQueryValueEx method that the caller wants to know how big a buffer is
required in order to store the value for the key. The implementation would then allocate a buffer of
the appropriate size and call RegQueryValueEx again, and for values that are to be returned as strings,
would then allocate a string based on the data in that buffer. This PR instead recognizes that the vast
majority of data returned from calls to the registry is relatively small. It starts with a stackalloc’d
buffer of 512 bytes, and uses that buffer as part of the initial call to RegQueryValueEx. If the buffer
was sufficiently large, we no longer have to make a second system call to retrieve the actual data: we
already got it. If the buffer was too small, we rent an ArrayPool buffer of sufficient size and use that
pooled buffer for the subsequent RegQueryValueEx call. Except in situations where we actually need
to return a byte[] array to the caller (e.g. the type of the key is REG_BINARY), this avoids the need for
the allocated byte[]. And for keys that return strings (e.g. the type of the key is REG_SZ), previously
the old implementation would have allocated a temporary char[] to use as the buffer passed to
RegQueryValueEx, but we can instead just reinterpret cast (e.g. MemoryMarshal.Cast) the original
buffer (whether a stackalloc’d span or the rented buffer as a Span<char>), and use that to construct
the resulting string.</p>

<p>Analyzers</p>
<p>The ability to easily plug custom code, whether for analyzers or source generators, into the Roslyn
compiler is one of my favorite features in all of C#. It means the developers working on C# don’t need
to be solely responsible for highlighting every possible thing you might want to diagnose in your
code. Instead, library authors can write their own analyzers, ship them either in dedicated nuget
packages or as side-by-side in nuget packages with APIs, and those analyzers augment the compiler’s
own analysis to help developers write better code. We ship a large number of analyzer rules in the
.NET SDK, many of which are focused on performance, and we augment that set with more and more
analyzers every release. We also work to apply more and more of those rules against our own
codebases in every release. .NET 7 is no exception.</p>
<p>One of my favorite new analyzers was added in dotnet/roslyn-analyzers#5594 from
<a href="https://github.com/NewellClark">@NewellClark</a> (and tweaked in dotnet/roslyn-analyzers#5972). In
my .NET 6 performance post, I talked about some of the overheads possible when types aren’t sealed:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Virtual calls are more expensive than regular non-virtual invocation and generally can’t be
inlined, since the JIT doesn’t know what is the actual type of the instance and thus the actual
target of the invocation (at least not without assistance from PGO). But if the JIT can see that a
virtual method is being invoked on a sealed type, it can devirtualize the call and potentially even
inline it.</p>
<p>If a type check (e.g. something is typeof(SomeType)) is performed where SomeType is sealed,
that check can be implemented along the lines of something is not null &amp;&amp;
something.GetType() == typeof(SomeType). In contrast, if SomeType is not sealed, the check is
going to be more along the lines of CastHelpers.IsInstanceOfClass(typeof(SomeType),
something), where IsInstanceOfClass is a non-trivial (and today non-inlined) call into a JIT
helper method in Corelib that not only checks for null and for direct equality with the specified
type, but also linearly walks the parent hierarchy of the type of the object being tested to see if it
might derive from the specified type.</p>
<p>Arrays in .NET are covariant, which means if types B and C both derive from type A, you can have
a variable typed as A[] that’s storing a B[]. Since C derives from A, it’s valid to treat a C as an A,
but if the A[] is actually a B[], storing a C into that array would mean storing a C into a B[],
which is invalid. Thus, every time you store an object reference into an array of reference types,
additional validation may need to be performed to ensure the reference being written is
compatible with the concrete type of the array in question. But, if A in this example were sealed,
nothing could derive from it, so storing objects into it doesn’t require such covariance checks.</p>
<p>Spans shift this covariance check to their constructor; rather than performing the covariance
check on every write into the array, the check is performed when a span is being constructed
from an array, such that if you try to create a new Span<A>(bArray), the ctor will throw an
exception. If A is sealed, the JIT is able to elide such a check as well.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>It effectively would be impossible for an analyzer to be able to safely recommend sealing public types.
After all, it has no knowledge of the type’s purpose, how it’s intended to be used, and whether anyone
outside of the assembly containing the type actually derives from it. But internal and private types are
another story. An analyzer can actually see every possible type that could be deriving from a private
type, since the analyzer has access to the whole compilation unit containing that type, and it needn’t
worry about compatibility because anything that could derive from such a type necessarily must also
be non-public and would be recompiled right along with the base type. Further, with the exception of
assemblies annotated as InternalsVisibleTo, an analyzer can have the same insight into internal types.
Thus, this PR adds CA1852, an analyzer that flags in non-InternalsVisibleTo assemblies all private and
internal types that aren’t sealed and that have no types deriving from them and recommends they be
sealed. (Due to some current limitations in the infrastructure around fixers and how this analyzer had
to be written in order to be able to see all of the types in the assembly, the analyzer for CA1852
doesn’t show up in Visual Studio. It can, however, be applied using the dotnet format tool. And if
you bump up the level of the rule from info to warning or error, it’ll show up as part of builds as well.)</p>
<p>In .NET 6, we sealed over 2300 types, but even with that, this analyzer ended up finding more to seal.
dotnet/runtime#59941 from <a href="https://github.com/NewellClark">@NewellClark</a> sealed another ~70
types, and dotnet/runtime#68268 which enabled the rule as an warning in dotnet/runtime (which
builds with warnings-as-errors) sealed another ~100 types. As a larger example of the rule in use,
ASP.NET hadn’t done much in the way of sealing types in previous releases, but with CA1852 now in
the .NET SDK, dotnet/aspnetcore#41457 enabled the analyzer and sealed more than ~1100 types.</p>
<p>Another new analyzer, CA1854, was added in dotnet/roslyn-analyzers#4851 from
<a href="https://github.com/CollinAlpert">@CollinAlpert</a> and then enabled in dotnet/runtime#70157. This
analyzer looks for the surprisingly common pattern where a Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;’s
ContainsKey is used to determine whether a dictionary contains a particular entry, and then if it does,
the dictionary’s indexer is used to retrieve the value associated with the key, e.g.</p>
<p>if (_dictionary.ContainsKey(key))
{
var value = _dictionary[key];
Use(value);
}</p>
<p>Dictionary’s TryGetValue method already combines both of these operations, both looking up the
key and retrieving its value if it exists, doing so as a single operation:</p>
<p>if (_dictionary.TryGetValue(key, out var value))
{
Use(value);
}</p>
<p>A benefit of this, in addition to arguably being simpler, is that it’s also faster. While Dictionary&lt;TKey,
TValue&gt; provides very fast lookups, and while the performance of those lookups has gotten faster
over time, doing fast work is still more expensive than doing no work, and if we can do one lookup
instead of two, that can result in a meaningful performance boost, in particular if it’s being performed
on a fast path. And we can see from this simple benchmark that looks up a word in a dictionary that,
for this operation, making distinct calls to ContainsKey and the indexer does indeed double the cost
of using the dictionary, almost exactly:</p>

<p>Somewhat ironically, even as I write this example, the analyzer and its auto-fixer are helpfully trying to
get me to change my benchmark code:</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>Similarly, dotnet/roslyn-analyzers#4836 from <a href="https://github.com/chucker">@chucker</a> added CA1853,
which looks for cases where a Remove call on a dictionary is guarded by a ContainsKey call. It seems
it’s fairly natural for developers to only call Remove on a dictionary once they’re sure the dictionary
contains the thing being removed; maybe they think Remove will throw an exception if the specified
key doesn’t exist. However, Remove actually allows this as a first-class scenario, with its return Boolean
value indicating whether the key was in the dictionary (and thus successfully removed) or not. An
example of this comes from dotnet/runtime#68724, where CA1853 was enabled for dotnet/runtime.
The EventPipeEventDispatcher type’s RemoveEventListener method had code like this:</p>
<p>if (m_subscriptions.ContainsKey(listener))
{
m_subscriptions.Remove(listener);
}</p>
<p>which the analyzer flagged and which it’s auto-fixer replaced with just:</p>
<p>m_subscriptions.Remove(listener);</p>
<p>Nice and simple. And faster, since as with the TryGetValue case, this is now doing a single dictionary
lookup rather than two. :::{custom-style=Figure}</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>:::</p>
<p>Another nice analyzer added in dotnet/roslyn-analyzers#5907 and dotnet/roslyn-analyzers#5910 is
CA1851, which looks for code that iterates through some kinds of enumerables multiple times.
Enumerating an enumerator, whether directly or via helper methods like those in LINQ, can have non-
trivial cost. Calling GetEnumerator typically allocates an enumerator object, and every item yielded
typically involves two interface calls, one to MoveNext and one to Current. If something can be done
via a single pass over the enumerable rather than multiple passes, that can save such costs. In some
cases, seeing places this analyzer fires can also inspire changes that avoid any use of enumerators. For
example, dotnet/runtime#67292 enabled CA1851 for dotnet/runtime, and in doing so, it fixed several
diagnostics issued by the analyzer (even in a code base that’s already fairly stringent about
enumerator and LINQ usage). As an example, this is a function in
System.ComponentModel.Composition that was flagged by the analyzer:</p>
<p>private void InitializeTypeCatalog(IEnumerable<Type> types)
{
foreach (Type type in types)
{
if (type == null)
{
throw ExceptionBuilder.CreateContainsNullElement(nameof(types));
}
else if (type.Assembly.ReflectionOnly)
{
throw new ArgumentException(SR.Format(SR.Argument_ElementReflectionOnlyType,
nameof(types)), nameof(types));
}
}</p>
<pre><code>_types = types.ToArray();
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>The method’s purpose is to convert the enumerable into an array to be stored, but also to validate
that the contents are all non-null and non-“ReflectionOnly.” To achieve that, the method is first using
a foreach to iterate through the enumerable, validating each element along the way, and then once
it’s done so, it calls ToArray() to convert the enumerable into an array. There are multiple problems</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>with this. First, it’s incurring the expense of interating through the enumerable twice, once for the
foreach and once for the ToArray(), which internally needs to enumerate it if it can’t do something
special like cast to ICollection<Type> and CopyTo the data out of it. Second, it’s possible the caller’s
IEnumerable<Type> changes on each iteration, so any validation done in the first iteration isn’t
actually ensuring there aren’t nulls in the resulting array, for example. Since the expectation of the
method is that all inputs are valid and we don’t need to optimize for the failure cases, the better
approach is to first call ToArray() and then validate the contents of that array, which is exactly what
that PR fixes it to do:</p>
<p>private void InitializeTypeCatalog(IEnumerable<Type> types)
{
Type[] arr = types.ToArray();
foreach (Type type in arr)
{
if (type == null)
{
throw ExceptionBuilder.CreateContainsNullElement(nameof(types));
}</p>
<pre><code>    if (type.Assembly.ReflectionOnly)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException(SR.Format(SR.Argument_ElementReflectionOnlyType,
</code></pre>
<p>nameof(types)), nameof(types));
}
}</p>
<pre><code>_types = arr;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>With that, we only ever iterate it once (and possibly 0 times if ToArray can special-case it, and bonus,
we validate on the copy rather than on the mutable original.</p>
<p>Yet another helpful analyzer is the new CA1850 introduced in dotnet/roslyn-analyzers#4797 from
<a href="https://github.com/wzchua">@wzchua</a>. It used to be that if you wanted to cryptographically hash
some data in .NET, you would create an instance of a hash algorithm and call its ComputeHash
method, e.g.</p>
<p>public byte[] Hash(byte[] data)
{
using (SHA256 h = SHA256.Create())
{
return h.ComputeHash(data);
}
}</p>
<p>However, .NET 5 introduced new “one-shot” hashing methods, which obviates the need to create a
new HashAlgorithm instance, providing a static method that performs the whole operation.</p>
<p>public byte[] Hash(byte[] data)
{
return SHA256.HashData(data);
}</p>
<p>CA1850 finds occurrences of the former pattern and recommends changing them to the latter.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>The result is not only simpler, it’s also faster:</p>
<p>private readonly byte[] _data = RandomNumberGenerator.GetBytes(128);</p>
<p>[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]
public byte[] Hash1()
{
using (SHA256 h = SHA256.Create())
{
return h.ComputeHash(_data);
}
}</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public byte[] Hash2()
{
return SHA256.HashData(_data);
}</p>

<p>The .NET 7 SDK also includes new analyzers around [GeneratedRegex(...)] (dotnet/runtime#68976)
and the already mentioned ones for LibraryImport, all of which help to move your code forwards to
more modern patterns that have better performance characteristics.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>This release also saw dotnet/runtime turn on a bunch of additional IDEXXXX code style rules and
make a huge number of code changes in response. Most of the resulting changes are purely about
simplifying the code, but in almost every case some portion of the changes also have a functional and
performance impact.</p>
<p>Let’s start with IDE0200, which is about removing unnecessary lambdas. Consider a setup like this:</p>
<p>public class C
{
public void CallSite() =&gt; M(i =&gt; Work(i));</p>
<pre><code>public void M(Action&lt;int&gt; action) { }
private static void Work(int value) { }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>Here we have a method CallSite that’s invoking a method M and passing a lambda to it. Method M
accepts an Action<int>, and the call site is passing a lambda that takes the supplied Int32 and
passes it off to some static functionality. For this code, the C# compiler is going to generate
something along the lines of this:</p>
<p>public class C
{
[CompilerGenerated]
private sealed class &lt;&gt;c
{
public static readonly &lt;&gt;c &lt;&gt;9 = new &lt;&gt;c();</p>
<pre><code>    public static Action&lt;int&gt; &lt;&gt;9__0_0;

    internal void &lt;CallSite&gt;b__0_0(int i) =&gt; Work(i);
}

public void CallSite() =&gt; M(&lt;&gt;c.&lt;&gt;9__0_0 ??= new
</code></pre>
<p>Action<int>(&lt;&gt;c.&lt;&gt;9.<CallSite>b__0_0));</p>
<pre><code>public void M(Action&lt;int&gt; action) { }
private static void Work(int value) { }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>The most important aspect of this is that &lt;&gt;9__0_0 field the compiler emitted. That field is a cache for
the delegate created in CallSite. The first time CallSite is invoked, it’ll allocate a new delegate for
the lambda and store it into that field. For all subsequent invocations, however, it’ll find the field is</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>non-null and will just reuse the same delegate. Thus, this lambda only ever results in a single
allocation for the whole process (ignoring any race conditions on the initial lazy initialization such that
multiple threads all racing to initialize the field might end up producing a few additional unnecessary
allocations). It’s important to recognize this caching only happens because the lambda doesn’t access
any instance state and doesn’t close over any locals; if it did either of those things, such caching
wouldn’t happen. Secondarily, it’s interesting to note the pattern the compiler uses for the lambda
itself. Note that generated <CallSite>b__0_0 method is generated as an instance method, and the
call site refers to that method of a singleton instance that’s used to initialize a &lt;&gt;9 field. That’s done
because delegates to static methods use something called a “shuffle thunk” to move arguments into
the right place for the target method invocation, making delegates to statics ever so slightly more
expensive to invoke than delegates to instance methods.</p>
<p>private Action _instance = new C().InstanceMethod;
private Action _static = C.StaticMethod;</p>
<p>[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]
public void InvokeInstance() =&gt; _instance();</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public void InvokeStatic() =&gt; _static();</p>
<p>private sealed class C
{
public static void StaticMethod() { }
public void InstanceMethod() { }
}</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Mean  Ratio</p>
<p>InvokeInstance  0.8858 ns</p>
<p>1.00</p>
<p>InvokeStatic</p>
<p>1.3979 ns</p>
<p>1.58</p>
<p>So, the compiler is able to cache references to lambdas, great. What about method groups, i.e. where
you just name the method directly? Previously, if changed my code to:</p>
<p>public class C
{
public void CallSite() =&gt; M(Work);</p>
<pre><code>public void M(Action&lt;int&gt; action) { }
private static void Work(int value) { }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>the compiler would generate the equivalent of:</p>
<p>public class C
{
public void CallSite() =&gt; M(new Action<int>(Work));</p>
<pre><code>public void M(Action&lt;int&gt; action) { }
private static void Work(int value) { }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>which has the unfortunate effect of allocating a new delegate on every invocation, even though we’re
still dealing with the exact same static method. Thanks to dotnet/roslyn#58288 from
<a href="https://github.com/pawchen">@pawchen</a>, the compiler will now generate the equivalent of:</p>
<p>public class C
{
[CompilerGenerated]
private static class &lt;&gt;O
{
public static Action<int> &lt;0&gt;__Work;
}</p>
<pre><code>public void CallSite() =&gt; M(&lt;&gt;O.&lt;0&gt;__Work ??= new Action&lt;int&gt;(Work));

public void M(Action&lt;int&gt; action) { }
private static void Work(int value) { }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>Note we again have a caching field that’s used to enable allocating the delegate once and caching it.
That means that places where code was using a lambda to enable this caching can now switch back to
the cleaner and simpler method group way of expressing the desired functionality. There is the
interesting difference to be cognizant of that since we don’t have a lambda which required the
compiler emitting a new method for, we’re still creating a delegate directly to the static method.
However, the minor difference in thunk overhead is typically made up for by the fact that we don’t
have a second method to invoke; in the common case where the static helper being invoked isn’t
inlinable (because it’s not super tiny, because it has exception handling, etc.), we previously would
have incurred the cost of the delegate invocation plus the non-inlinable method call, and now we just
have the cost of an ever-so-slightly more expensive delegate invocation; on the whole, it’s typically a
wash.</p>
<p>And that brings us to IDE0200, which recognizes lambda expressions that can be removed.
dotnet/runtime#71011 enabled the analyzer for dotnet/runtime, resulting in more than 100 call sites
changing accordingly. However, IDE0200 does more than just this mostly stylistic change. It also
recognizes some patterns that can make a more substantial impact. Consider this code that was
changed as part of that PR:</p>
<p>Action disposeAction;
IDisposable? disposable = null;
...
if (disposable != null)
{
disposeAction = () =&gt; disposable.Dispose();
}</p>
<p>That delegate closes over the disposable local, which means this method needs to allocate a display
class. But IDE0200 recognizes that instead of closing over disposable, we can create the delegate
directly to the Dispose method:</p>
<p>Action disposeAction;
IDisposable? disposable = null;
...
if (disposable != null)
{</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>disposeAction = disposable.Dispose;
}</p>
<p>We still get a delegate allocation, but we avoid the display class allocation, and as a bonus we save on
the additional metadata required for the synthesized display class and method generated for the
lambda.</p>
<p>IDE0020 is another good example of an analyzer that is primarily focused on making code cleaner,
more maintainable, more modern, but that can also lead to removing overhead from many different
places. The analyzer looks for code performing unnecessary duplicative casts and recommends using
C# pattern matching syntax instead. For example, dotnet/runtime#70523 enabled the analyzer and
switched more than 250 locations from code like:</p>
<p>if (value is SqlDouble)
{
SqlDouble i = (SqlDouble)value;
return CompareTo(i);
}</p>
<p>to instead be like:</p>
<p>if (value is SqlDouble i)
{
return CompareTo(i);
}</p>
<p>In addition to being cleaner, this ends up saving a cast operation, which can add measurable
overhead if the JIT is unable to remove it:</p>
<p>private object _value = new List<string>();</p>
<p>[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]
public List<string> WithCast()
{
object value = _value;
return value is List<string> ? (List<string>)value : null;
}</p>
<p>[Benchmark]
public List<string> WithPattern()
{
object value = _value;
return value is List<string> list ? list : null;
}</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Mean  Ratio</p>
<p>WithCast</p>
<p>2.602 ns</p>
<p>1.00</p>
<p>WithPattern  1.886 ns</p>
<p>0.73</p>
<p>Then there’s IDE0031, which promotes using null propagation features of C#. This analyzer typically
manifests as recommending changing snippets like:</p>
<p>return _value != null ? _value.Property : null;</p>
<p>into code that’s instead like:</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>return _value?.Property;</p>
<p>Nice, concise, and primarily about cleaning up the code and making it simpler and more maintainable
by utilizing newer C# syntax. However, there is also a small performance advantage in some situations
as well. For example, consider this snippet:</p>
<p>public class C
{
private C _value;</p>
<pre><code>public int? Get1() =&gt; _value != null ? _value.Prop : null;
public int? Get2() =&gt; _value?.Prop;

public int Prop =&gt; 42;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>The C# compiler lowers these expressions to the equivalent of this:</p>
<p>public Nullable<int> Get1()
{
if (_value == null) return null;
return _value.Prop;
}</p>
<p>public Nullable<int> Get2()
{
C value = _value;
if (value == null) return null;
return value.Prop;
}</p>
<p>for which the JIT then generates:</p>
<p>; Program.Get1()
push      rax
mov       rdx,[rcx+8]
test      rdx,rdx
jne       short M00_L00
xor       eax,eax
add       rsp,8
ret
M00_L00:
cmp       [rdx],dl
mov       dword ptr [rsp+4],2A
mov       byte ptr [rsp],1
mov       rax,[rsp]
add       rsp,8
ret
; Total bytes of code 40</p>
<p>; Program.Get2()
push      rax
mov       rax,[rcx+8]
test      rax,rax
jne       short M00_L00
xor       eax,eax
add       rsp,8
ret
M00_L00:</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>mov       dword ptr [rsp+4],2A
mov       byte ptr [rsp],1
mov       rax,[rsp]
add       rsp,8
ret
; Total bytes of code 38</p>
<p>Note how the Get1 variant has an extra cmp instruction (cmp [rdx],dl) in the otherwise identical
assembly to Get2 (other than register selection). That cmp instruction in Get1 is the JIT forcing a null
check on the second read of _value prior to accessing its Prop, whereas in Get2 the null check against
the local means the JIT doesn’t need to add an additional null check on the second use of the local,
since nothing could have changed it. dotnet/runtime#70965 rolled out additional use of the null
propagation operator via auto-fixing IDE0031, resulting in ~120 uses being improved.</p>
<p>Another interesting example is IDE0060, which finds unused parameters and recommends removing
them. This was done for non-public members in System.Private.CoreLib in dotnet/runtime#63015. As
with some of the other mentioned rules, it’s primarily about good hygiene. There can be some small
additional cost associated with passing additional parameters (the overhead of reading the values at
the call site, putting them into the right register or stack location, etc., and also the metadata size
associated with the additional parameter information), but the larger benefit comes from auditing all
of the cited violations and finding places where work is simply being performed unnecessarily. For
example, that PR made some updates to the TimeZoneInfo type’s implementation for Unix. In that
implementation is a TZif_ParseRaw method, which is used to extract some information from a time
zone data file. Amongst many input and output parameters, it had out bool[] StandardTime, out
bool[] GmtTime, which the implementation was dutifully filling in by allocating and populating new
arrays for each. The call site for TZif_ParseRaw was then taking those arrays and feeding them into
another method TZif_GenerateAdjustmentRules, which ignored them! Thus, not only was this PR
able to remove those parameters from TZif_GenerateAdjustmentRules, it was able to update
TZif_ParseRaw to no longer need to allocate and populate those arrays at all, which obviously yields
a much larger gain.</p>
<p>One final example of peanut-buttery performance improvements from applying an analyzer comes
from dotnet/runtime#70896 and dotnet/runtime#71361, which applied IDE0029 across
dotnet/runtime. IDE0029 flags cases where null coalescing can be used, e.g. flagging:</p>
<p>return message != null ? message : string.Empty;</p>
<p>and recommending it be converted to:</p>
<p>return message ?? string.Empty;</p>
<p>As with some of the previous rules discussed, that in and of itself doesn’t make a meaningful
performance improvement, and rather is about clarity and simplicity. However, in various cases it can.
For example, the aforementioned PRs contained an example like:</p>
<p>null != foundColumns[i] ? foundColumns[i] : DBNull.Value;</p>
<p>which is rewritten to:</p>
<p>foundColumns[i] ?? DBNull.Value</p>
<p>This avoids an unnecessary re-access to an array. Or again from those PRs the expression:</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers</p>
<p>entry.GetKey(_thisCollection) != null ? entry.GetKey(_thisCollection) : &quot;key&quot;</p>
<p>being changed to:</p>
<p>entry.GetKey(_thisCollection) ?? &quot;key&quot;</p>
<p>and avoiding an unnecessary table lookup.</p>
