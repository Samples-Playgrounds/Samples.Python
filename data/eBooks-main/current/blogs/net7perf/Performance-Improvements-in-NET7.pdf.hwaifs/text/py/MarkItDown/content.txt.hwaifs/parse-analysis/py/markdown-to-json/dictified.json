{"root": ["Performance Improvements\nin .NET 7", "Stephen Toub", "Partner Software Engineer, .NET", "Microsoft", "\fIntroduction", "A year ago, I published Performance Improvements in .NET 6, following on the heels of similar posts\nfor .NET 5, .NET Core 3.0, .NET Core 2.1, and .NET Core 2.0. I enjoy writing these posts and love\nreading developers\u2019 responses to them. One comment in particular last year resonated with me. The\ncommenter cited the Die Hard movie quote, \u201c\u2018When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he\nwept for there were no more worlds to conquer\u2019,\u201d and questioned whether .NET performance\nimprovements were similar. Has the well run dry? Are there no more \u201c[performance] worlds to\nconquer\u201d? I\u2019m a bit giddy to say that, even with how fast .NET 6 is, .NET 7 definitively highlights how\nmuch more can be and has been done.", "As with previous versions of .NET, performance is a key focus that pervades the entire stack, whether it\nbe features created explicitly for performance or non-performance-related features that are still\ndesigned and implemented with performance keenly in mind. And now that a .NET 7 release\ncandidate is just around the corner, it\u2019s a good time to discuss much of it. Over the course of the last\nyear, every time I\u2019ve reviewed a PR that might positively impact performance, I\u2019ve copied that link to a\njournal I maintain for the purposes of writing this post. When I sat down to write this a few weeks ago,\nI was faced with a list of almost 1000 performance-impacting PRs (out of more than 7000 PRs that\nwent into the release), and I\u2019m excited to share approximately 500 of them here with you.", "One thought before we dive in. In past years, I\u2019ve received the odd piece of negative feedback about\nthe length of some of my performance-focused write-ups, and while I disagree with the criticism, I\nrespect the opinion. So, this year, consider this a \u201cchoose your own adventure.\u201d If you\u2019re here just\nlooking for a super short adventure, one that provides the top-level summary and a core message to\ntake away from your time here, I\u2019m happy to oblige:", "TL;DR: .NET 7 is fast. Really fast. A thousand performance-impacting PRs went into runtime and core\nlibraries this release, never mind all the improvements in ASP.NET Core and Windows Forms and\nEntity Framework and beyond. It\u2019s the fastest .NET ever. If your manager asks you why your project\nshould upgrade to .NET 7, you can say \u201cin addition to all the new functionality in the release, .NET 7 is\nsuper fast.\u201d", "Or, if you prefer a slightly longer adventure, one filled with interesting nuggets of performance-\nfocused data, consider skimming through the post, looking for the small code snippets and\ncorresponding tables showing a wealth of measurable performance improvements. At that point, you,\ntoo, may walk away with your head held high and my thanks.", "Both noted paths achieve one of my primary goals for spending the time to write these posts, to\nhighlight the greatness of the next release and to encourage everyone to give it a try. But, I have other\ngoals for these posts, too. I want everyone interested to walk away from this post with an upleveled\nunderstanding of how .NET is implemented, why various decisions were made, tradeoffs that were\nevaluated, techniques that were employed, algorithms that were considered, and valuable tools and\napproaches that were utilized to make .NET even faster than it was previously. I want developers to\nlearn from our own learnings and find ways to apply this new-found knowledge to their own\ncodebases, thereby further increasing the overall performance of code in the ecosystem. I want\ndevelopers to take an extra beat, think about reaching for a profiler the next time they\u2019re working on a", "\fgnarly problem, think about looking at the source for the component they\u2019re using in order to better\nunderstand how to work with it, and think about revisiting previous assumptions and decisions to\ndetermine whether they\u2019re still accurate and appropriate. And I want developers to be excited at the\nprospect of submitting PRs to improve .NET not only for themselves but for every developer around\nthe globe using .NET. If any of that sounds interesting, then I encourage you to choose the last\nadventure: prepare a carafe of your favorite hot beverage, get comfortable, and please enjoy.", "\fContents", "Setup

Being able to\nunderstand exactly what assembly code is generated by the JIT is critical when fine-tuning lower-level,\nperformance-sensitive code. There are multiple ways to get at that assembly code. The online tool\nsharplab.io is incredibly useful for this (thanks to [@ashmind](https://github.com/ashmind) for this\ntool); however it currently only targets a single release, so as I write this I\u2019m only able to see the\noutput for .NET 6, which makes it difficult to use for A/B comparisons. godbolt.org is also valuable for\nthis, with C# support added in compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer#3168 from\n[@hez2010](https://github.com/hez2010), with similar limitations. The most flexible solutions involve\ngetting at that assembly code locally, as it enables comparing whatever versions or local builds you\ndesire with whatever configurations and switches set that you need.", "One common approach is to use the [DisassemblyDiagnoser] in benchmarkdotnet. Simply slap the\n[DisassemblyDiagnoser] attribute onto your test class: benchmarkdotnet will find the assembly code\ngenerated for your tests and some depth of functions they call, and dump out the found assembly\ncode in a human-readable form.

This support was recently improved further in dotnet/benchmarkdotnet#2072, which\nallows passing a filter list on the command-line to benchmarkdotnet to tell it exactly which methods\u2019\nassembly code should be dumped.", "If you can get your hands on a \u201cdebug\u201d or \u201cchecked\u201d build of the .NET runtime (\u201cchecked\u201d is a build\nthat has optimizations enabled but also still includes asserts), and specifically of clrjit.dll, another\nvaluable approach is to set an environment variable that causes the JIT itself to spit out a human-\nreadable description of all of the assembly code it emits. This can be used with any kind of\napplication, as it\u2019s part of the JIT itself rather than part of any specific tool or other environment, it\nsupports showing the code the JIT generates each time it generates code (e.g. if it first compiles a\nmethod without optimization and then later recompiles it with optimization), and overall it\u2019s the most\naccurate picture of the assembly code as it comes \u201cstraight from the horses mouth,\u201d as it were. The\n(big) downside of course is that it requires a non-release build of the runtime, which typically means\nyou need to build it yourself from the sources in the dotnet/runtime repo.", "\u2026 until .NET 7, that is.

Set that to \u201c1\u201d, and it\u2019ll result in the JIT emitting a line every time it compiles a\nmethod, including the name of that method which is copy/pasteable with DOTNET_JitDisasm.

way, let\u2019s move on to actual performance improvements, starting with on-stack\nreplacement.", "On-Stack Replacement", "On-stack replacement (OSR) is one of the coolest features to hit the JIT in .NET 7. But to really\nunderstand OSR, we first need to understand tiered compilation, so a quick recap\u2026", "One of the issues a managed environment with a JIT compiler has to deal with is tradeoffs between\nstartup and throughput. Historically, the job of an optimizing compiler is to, well, optimize, in order to\nenable the best possible throughput of the application or service once running. But such optimization\ntakes analysis, takes time, and performing all of that work then leads to increased startup time, as all\nof the code on the startup path (e.g. all of the code that needs to be run before a web server can\nserve the first request) needs to be compiled. So a JIT compiler needs to make tradeoffs: better\nthroughput at the expense of longer startup time, or better startup time at the expense of decreased\nthroughput. For some kinds of apps and services, the tradeoff is an easy call, e.g. if your service starts\nup once and then runs for days, several extra seconds of startup time doesn\u2019t matter, or if you\u2019re a\nconsole application that\u2019s going to do a quick computation and exit, startup time is all that matters.\nBut how can the JIT know which scenario it\u2019s in, and do we really want every developer having to\nknow about these kinds of settings and tradeoffs and configure every one of their applications\naccordingly? One answer to this has been ahead-of-time compilation, which has taken various forms\nin .NET. For example, all of the core libraries are \u201ccrossgen\u201d\u2019d, meaning they\u2019ve been run through a\ntool that produces the previously mentioned R2R format, yielding binaries that contain assembly code\nthat needs only minor tweaks to actually execute; not every method can have code generated for it,\nbut enough that it significantly reduces startup time. Of course, such approaches have their own\ndownsides, e.g. one of the promises of a JIT compiler is it can take advantage of knowledge of the\ncurrent machine / process in order to best optimize, so for example the R2R images have to assume a", "13", "CHAPTER 2 | JIT", "\fcertain baseline instruction set (e.g. what vectorizing instructions are available) whereas the JIT can see\nwhat\u2019s actually available and use the best. \u201cTiered compilation\u201d provides another answer, one that\u2019s\nusable with or without these other ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation solutions.", "Tiered compilation enables the JIT to have its proverbial cake and eat it, too. The idea is simple: allow\nthe JIT to compile the same code multiple times. The first time, the JIT can use as a few optimizations\nas make sense (a handful of optimizations can actually make the JIT\u2019s own throughput faster, so those\nstill make sense to apply), producing fairly unoptimized assembly code but doing so really quickly.\nAnd when it does so, it can add some instrumentation into the assembly to track how often the\nmethods are called. As it turns out, many functions used on a startup path are invoked once or maybe\nonly a handful of times, and it would take more time to optimize them than it does to just execute\nthem unoptimized. Then, when the method\u2019s instrumentation triggers some threshold, for example a\nmethod having been executed 30 times, a work item gets queued to recompile that method, but this\ntime with all the optimizations the JIT can throw at it. This is lovingly referred to as \u201ctiering up.\u201d Once\nthat recompilation has completed, call sites to the method are patched with the address of the newly\nhighly optimized assembly code, and future invocations will then take the fast path. So, we get faster\nstartup and faster sustained throughput. At least, that\u2019s the hope.", "A problem, however, is methods that don\u2019t fit this mold. While it\u2019s certainly the case that many\nperformance-sensitive methods are relatively quick and executed many, many, many times, there\u2019s\nalso a large number of performance-sensitive methods that are executed just a handful of times, or\nmaybe even only once, but that take a very long time to execute, maybe even the duration of the\nwhole process: methods with loops. As a result, by default tiered compilation hasn\u2019t applied to loops,\nthough it can be enabled by setting the DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops environment variable to 1.

There are various things the JIT can learn about a method during tier-0 that it can\nthen use for tier-1.

The Regex source generator applies a technique based on this in\ndotnet/runtime#67775. Regex supports setting a process-wide timeout that gets applied to Regex\ninstances that don\u2019t explicitly set a timeout. That means, even though it\u2019s super rare for such a\nprocess-wide timeout to be set, the Regex source generator still needs to output timeout-related code\njust in case it\u2019s needed.

The JIT has been able to do such an optimization since tiered\ncompilation was introduced in .NET Core 3.0. Now in .NET 7, though, with OSR it\u2019s also able to do so\nby default for methods with loops (and thus enable cases like the regex one). However, the real magic\nof OSR comes into play when combined with another exciting feature: dynamic PGO.", "PGO", "I wrote about profile-guided optimization (PGO) in my Performance Improvements in .NET 6 post, but\nI\u2019ll cover it again here as it\u2019s seen a multitude of improvements for .NET 7.", "PGO has been around for a long time, in any number of languages and compilers. The basic idea is\nyou compile your app, asking the compiler to inject instrumentation into the application to track\nvarious pieces of interesting information. You then put your app through its paces, running through\nvarious common scenarios, causing that instrumentation to \u201cprofile\u201d what happens when the app is\nexecuted, and the results of that are then saved out. The app is then recompiled, feeding those\ninstrumentation results back into the compiler, and allowing it to optimize the app for exactly how it\u2019s\nexpected to be used. This approach to PGO is referred to as \u201cstatic PGO,\u201d as the information is all\ngleaned ahead of actual deployment, and it\u2019s something .NET has been doing in various forms for\nyears. From my perspective, though, the really interesting development in .NET is \u201cdynamic PGO,\u201d\nwhich was introduced in .NET 6, but off by default.", "Dynamic PGO takes advantage of tiered compilation. I noted that the JIT instruments the tier-0 code\nto track how many times the method is called, or in the case of loops, how many times the loop\nexecutes. It can instrument it for other things as well. For example, it can track exactly which concrete\ntypes are used as the target of an interface dispatch, and then in tier-1 specialize the code to expect\nthe most common types (this is referred to as \u201cguarded devirtualization,\u201d or GDV).

In some cases, optimizations can do better when they\u2019re exposed to more of the\nprogram, in other words when the tree they\u2019re operating on is larger and contains more to be\nanalyzed. However, various operations can break up these trees into smaller, individual ones, such as\nwith temporary variables created as part of inlining, and in doing so can inhibit these operations.\nSomething is needed in order to effectively stitch these trees back together, and that\u2019s forward\nsubstitution. You can think of forward substitution almost like an inverse of CSE; rather than trying to\nfind duplicate expressions and eliminate them by computing the value once and storing it into a\ntemporary, forward substitution eliminates that temporary and effectively moves the expression tree\ninto its use site.

You\u2019ve got a list of numbers and you want to find the index\nof a particular value? You could walk the list comparing one element at a time, and that would be fine\nfunctionally.

One of\nVector<T>\u2019s greatest strengths is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The type is designed to adapt to\nwhatever width vector instructions are available in your hardware. If the machine supports 256-bit\nwidth vectors, great, that\u2019s what Vector<T> will target. If not, if the machine supports 128-bit width\nvectors, great, that\u2019s what Vector<T> targets. But that flexibility comes with various downsides, at least\ntoday; for example, the operations you can perform on a Vector<T> end up needing to be agnostic to\nthe width of the vectors used, since the width is variable based on the hardware on which the code\nactually runs. And that means the operations that can be exposed on Vector<T> are limited, which in\nturn limits the kinds of operations that can be vectorized with it. Also, because it\u2019s only ever a single\nsize in a given process, some data set sizes that fall in between 128 bits and 256 bits might not be\nprocessed as well as you\u2019d hope. You write your Vector<byte>-based algorithm, and you run it on a\nmachine with support for 256-bit vectors, which means it can process 32 bytes at a time, but then you\nfeed it an input with 31 bytes. Had Vector<T> mapped to 128-bit vectors, it could have been used to\nimprove the processing of that input, but as its vector size is larger than the input data size, the\nimplementation ends up falling back to one that\u2019s not accelerated. There are also issues related to\nR2R and Native AOT, since ahead-of-time compilation needs to know in advance what instructions\nshould be used for Vector<T> operations. You already saw this earlier when discussing the output of\nDOTNET_JitDisasmSummary; we saw that the NarrowUtf16ToAscii method was one of only a few\nmethods that was JIT compiled in a \u201chello, world\u201d console app, and that this was because it lacked R2R\ncode due to its use of Vector<T>.", "Starting in .NET Core 3.0, .NET gained literally thousands of new \u201chardware intrinsics\u201d methods, most\nof which are .NET APIs that map down to one of these SIMD instructions. These intrinsics enable an\nexpert to write an implementation tuned to a specific instruction set, and if done well, get the best\npossible performance, but it also requires the developer to understand each instruction set and to\nimplement their algorithm for each instruction set that might be relevant, e.g. an AVX2\nimplementation if it\u2019s supported, or an SSE2 implementation if it\u2019s supported, or an ArmBase\nimplementation if it\u2019s supported, and so on.", ".NET 7 has introduced a middle ground.

This has\nthe obvious advantage of avoiding the overhead of a method call, but except for really small methods\non really hot paths, that\u2019s often on the smaller side of the wins inlining brings. The bigger wins are\ndue to the callee\u2019s code being exposed to the caller\u2019s code, and vice versa. So, for example, if the\ncaller is passing a constant as an argument to the callee, if the method isn\u2019t inlined, the compilation of\nthe callee has no knowledge of that constant, but if the callee is inlined, all of the code in the callee is\nthen aware of its argument being a constant value, and can do all of the optimizations possible with\nsuch a constant, like dead code elimination, branch elimination, constant folding and propagation,\nand so on. Of course, if it were all rainbows and unicorns, everything possible to be inlined would be\ninlined, and that\u2019s obviously not happening. Inlining brings with it the cost of potentially increased\nbinary size. If the code being inlined would result in the same amount or less assembly code in the\ncaller than it takes to call the callee (and if the JIT can quickly determine that), then inlining is a no-\nbrainer. But if the code being inlined would increase the size of the callee non-trivially, now the JIT\nneeds to weigh that increase in code size against the throughput benefits that could come from it.\nThat code size increase can itself result in throughput regressions, due to increasing the number of\ndistinct instructions to be executed and thereby putting more pressure on the instruction cache. As\nwith any cache, the more times you need to read from memory to populate it, the less effective the\ncache will be. If you have a function that gets inlined into 100 different call sites, every one of those\ncall sites\u2019 copies of the callee\u2019s instructions are unique, and calling each of those 100 functions could\nend up thrashing the instruction cache; in contrast, if all of those 100 functions \u201cshared\u201d the same\ninstructions by simply calling the single instance of the callee, it\u2019s likely the instruction cache would be\nmuch more effective and lead to fewer trips to memory.", "All that is to say, inlining is really important, it\u2019s important that the \u201cright\u201d things be inlined and that it\nnot overinline, and as such every release of .NET in recent memory has seen nice improvements\naround inlining. .NET 7 is no exception.", "One really interesting improvement around inlining is dotnet/runtime#64521, and it might be\nsurprising.

Previously, any methods with catch or filter exception handling clauses\ncouldn\u2019t be AOT compiled and would fall back to being interpreted. With this PR, the method is now\nable to be AOT compiled, and it only falls back to using the interpreter when an exception actually\noccurs, switching over to the interpreter for the remainder of that method call\u2019s execution. Since many\nmethods contain such clauses, this can make a big difference in throughput and CPU consumption. In\nthe same vein, dotnet/runtime#63065 enabled methods with finally exception handling clauses to\nbe AOT compiled; just the finally block gets interpreted rather than the entire method being\ninterpreted.", "Beyond such backend improvements, another class of improvement came from further unification\nbetween coreclr and mono. Years ago, coreclr and mono had their own entire library stack built on\ntop of them. Over time, as .NET was open sourced, portions of mono\u2019s stack got replaced by shared\ncomponents, bit by bit. Fast forward to today, all of the core .NET libraries above\nSystem.Private.CoreLib are the same regardless of which runtime is being employed. In fact, the\nsource for CoreLib itself is almost entirely shared, with ~95% of the source files being compiled into\nthe CoreLib that\u2019s built for each runtime, and just a few percent of the source specialized for each\n(these statements means that the vast majority of the performance improvements discussed in the\nrest of this post apply equally whether running on mono and coreclr). Even so, every release now we\ntry to chip away at that few remaining percent, for reasons of maintainability, but also because the\nsource used for coreclr\u2019s CoreLib has generally had more attention paid to it from a performance\nperspective. dotnet/runtime#71325, for example, moves mono\u2019s array and span sorting generic\nsorting utility class over to the more efficient implementation used by coreclr.", "One of the biggest categories of improvements, however, is in vectorization. This comes in two pieces.\nFirst, Vector<T> and Vector128<T> are now fully accelerated on both x64 and Arm64, thanks to PRs\nlike dotnet/runtime#64961, dotnet/runtime#65086, dotnet/runtime#65128, dotnet/runtime#66317,", "76", "CHAPTER 5 | Mono", "\fdotnet/runtime#66391, dotnet/runtime#66409, dotnet/runtime#66512, dotnet/runtime#66586,\ndotnet/runtime#66589, dotnet/runtime#66597, dotnet/runtime#66476, and dotnet/runtime#67125;\nthat significant amount of work means all that code that gets vectorized using these abstractions will\nlight-up on mono and coreclr alike.

It\u2019s also difficult to handle well in the face of tooling like a linker or a solution like Native\nAOT that needs to be able to determine at build time exactly what code will be executed, and it\u2019s\ngenerally quite expensive at run-time; thus it\u2019s both something we strive to avoid when possible but\nalso invest in reducing the costs of, as it\u2019s so popular in so many different kinds of applications\nbecause it is incredibly useful.

Available via MethodBase.Invoke, this\nfunctionality let\u2019s you take a MethodBase (e.g. MethodInfo) object that represents some method for\nwhich the caller previously queried, and call it, with arbitrary arguments that the runtime needs to\nmarshal through to the callee, and with an arbitrary return value that needs to be marshaled back. If\nyou know the signature of the method ahead of time, the best way to optimize invocation speed is to\ncreate a delegate from the MethodBase via CreateDelegate<T> and then use that delegate for all\nfuture invocations. But in some circumstances, you don\u2019t know the signature at compile time, and thus\ncan\u2019t easily rely on delegates with known matching signatures. To address this, some libraries have\ntaken to using reflection emit to generate code at run-time specific to the target method. This is\nextremely complicated and it\u2019s not something we want apps to have to do. Instead, in .NET 7 via\ndotnet/runtime#66357, dotnet/runtime#69575, and dotnet/runtime#74614, Invoke will itself use\nreflection emit (in the form of DynamicMethod) to generate a delegate that is customized for invoking\nthe target, and then future invocation via that MethodInfo will utilize that generated method.

As machines scale up to have more and more cores, and\nmore and more threads, there\u2019s more and more contention on these shared queues, and in particular\non the global queue.

Multiple APIs in .NET implement this encoding. For\nconverting between binary data represented as ReadOnlySpan<byte> and UTF8 (actually ASCII)\nencoded data also represented as ReadOnlySpan<byte>, the System.Buffers.Text.Base64 type\nprovides EncodeToUtf8 and DecodeFromUtf8 methods.

As an example,\nStringBuilder has an Append(char* value, int valueCount) overload which copies the specified\nnumber of characters from the specified pointer into the StringBuilder, and other APIs were\nimplemented in terms of this method; for example, the Append(string? value, int startIndex,\nint count) method was essentially implemented as:", "fixed (char* ptr = value)\n{\nAppend(ptr + startIndex, count);\n}", "That fixed statement translates into a \u201cpinning pointer.\u201d Normally the GC is free to move managed\nobjects around on the heap, which it might do in order to compact the heap (to, for example, avoid\nsmall, unusuable fragments of memory between objects). But if the GC can move objects around, a\nnormal native pointer into that memory would be terribly unsafe and unreliable, as without notice the\ndata being pointed to could move and your pointer could now be pointing to garbage or to some\nother object that was shifted to this location. There are two ways for dealing with this. The first is a\n\u201cmanaged pointer,\u201d otherwise known as a \u201creference\u201d or \u201cref,\u201d as that\u2019s exactly what you get when you\nhave the \u201cref\u201d keyword in C#; it\u2019s a pointer that the runtime will update with the correct value when it\nmoves the object being pointed into. The second is to prevent the pointed-to object from being\nmoved, \u201cpinning\u201d it in place. And that\u2019s what the \u201cfixed\u201d keyword does, pinning the referenced object\nfor the duration of the fixed block, during which time it\u2019s safe to use the supplied pointer. Thankfully,\npinning is cheap when no GC occurs; when a GC does occur, however, pinned objects aren\u2019t able to be\nmoved around, and thus pinning can have a global impact on the performance of the application (and\non GCs themselves). There are also various optimizations inhibited by pinning. With all of the advents\nin C# around being able to use ref in many more places (e.g. ref locals, ref returns, and now in C# 11,\nref fields), and with all of the new APIs in .NET for manipulating refs (e.g. Unsafe.Add,\nUnsafe.AreSame), it\u2019s now possible to rewrite code that was using pinning pointers to instead use\nmanaged pointers, thereby avoiding the problems that come from pinning.

System.HashCode\u2019s goal is to provide a fast, easy-to-use\nimplementation for producing high-quality hash codes. In its current incarnation, it incorporates a\nrandom process-wide seed and is an implementation of the xxHash32 non-cryptographic hash\nalgorithm. In a previous release, HashCode saw the addition of an AddBytes methods, which accepts a\nReadOnlySpan<byte> and is useful for incorporating sequences of data that should be part of a type\u2019s\nhash code, e.g. BigInteger.GetHashCode includes all the data that makes up the BigInteger. The\nxxHash32 algorithm works by accumulating 4 32-bit unsigned integers and then combining them\ntogether into the hash code; thus if you call HashCode.Add(int), the first three times you call it you\u2019re\njust storing the values separately into the instance, and then the fourth time you call it all of those\nvalues are combined into the hash code (and there\u2019s a separate process that incorporates any\nremaining values if the number of 32-bit values added wasn\u2019t an exact multiple of 4). Thus, previously\nAddBytes was simply implemented to repeatedly read the next 4 bytes from the input span and call\nAdd(int) with those bytes as an integer. But those Add calls have overhead. Instead, this PR skips the\nAdd calls and directly handles the accumulation and combining of the 16 bytes. Interestingly, it still has\nto deal with the possibility that previous calls to Add may have left some state queued, which means\n(with the current implementation at least), if there are multiple pieces of state to include in the hash\ncode, say a ReadOnlySpan<byte> and an additional int, it\u2019s more efficient to add the span first and\nthen the int rather than the other way around.

It has two primary modes of\nexecution, one that relies on DFAs (deterministic finite automata) and one that relies on NFAs (non-\ndeterministic finite automata). Both implementations provide a very valuable guarantee: processing\ntime is linear in the length of the input.

Regex derivatives form the basis for\nhow the automata (think \u201cgraph\u201d) used to process input are constructed. The idea at its core is fairly\nsimple: take a regex and process a single character\u2026 what is the new regex you get to describe what\nremains after processing that one character?

Simple, right? How about something more\ncomplicated, like the expression .*(the|he). What happens if the next character is a t? Well, it\u2019s\npossible that t could be consumed by the .* at the beginning of the pattern, in which case the\nremaining regex would be exactly the same as the starting one (.*(the|he)), since after matching t\nwe could still match exactly the same input as without the t. But, the t could have also been part of\nmatching the, and applied to the, we\u2019d strip off the t and be left with he, so now our derivative is\n.*(the|he)|he. Then what about the he in the original alternation? t doesn\u2019t match h, so the\nderivative would be nothing, which we\u2019ll express here as an empty character class, giving us\n.*(the|he)|he|[]. Of course, as part of an alternation, that \u201cnothing\u201d at the end is a nop, and so we\ncan simplify the whole derivative to just .*(the|he)|he\u2026 done. That was all when applying the\noriginal pattern against a next t. What if it was against an h instead? Following the same logic as for\nthe t, this time we end up with .*(the|he)|e. And so on. What if we instead start with the h\nderivative and the next character is an e? Then we\u2019re taking the pattern .*(the|he)|e and applying it\nto e. Against the left side of the alternation, it can be consumed by the .* (but doesn\u2019t match either t\nor h), and so we just end up with that same subexpression. But against the right side of the\nalternation, e matches e, leaving us with the empty string (): .*(the|he)|().

For every regex construct (concatenations, alternations,\nloops, etc.) the engine knows how to derive the next regex based on the character being evaluated.\nThis application is done lazily, so we have an initial starting state (the original pattern), and then when\nwe evaluate the next character in the input, it looks to see whether there\u2019s already a derivative\navailable for that transition: if there is, it follows it, and if there isn\u2019t, it dynamically/lazily derives the\nnext node in the graph. At its core, that\u2019s how it works.", "Of course, the devil is in the details and there\u2019s a ton of complication and engineering smarts that go\ninto making the engine efficient. One such example is a tradeoff between memory consumption and\nthroughput. Given the ability to have any char as input, you could have effectively ~65K transitions\nout of every node (e.g. every node could need a ~65K element table); that would significantly increase\nmemory consumption. However, if you actually had that many transitions, it\u2019s very likely a significant\nmajority of them would point to the same target node. Thus, NonBacktracking maintains its own\ngroupings of characters into what it calls \u201cminterms.\u201d If two characters will have exactly the same\ntransition, they\u2019re part of the same minterm. The transitions are then constructed in terms of\nminterms, with at most one transition per minterm out of a given node. When the next input character\nis read, it maps that to a minterm ID, and then finds the appropriate transition for that ID; one\nadditional level of indirection in order to save a potentially huge amount of memory. That mapping is\nhandled via an array bitmap for ASCII and an efficient data structure known as a Binary Decision\nDiagram (BDD) for everything above 0x7F.", "As noted, the non-backtracking engine is linear in the length of the input. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\nalways looks at each input character exactly once. If you call Regex.IsMatch, it does; after all, IsMatch\nonly needs to determine whether there is a match and doesn\u2019t need to compute any additional\ninformation, such as where the match actual starts or ends, any information on captures, etc. Thus, the\nengine can simply employ its automata to walk along the input, transitioning from node to node in\nthe graph until it comes to a final state or runs out of input. Other operations, however, do require it\nto gather more information. Regex.Match needs to compute everything, and that can actually entail\nmultiple walks over the input. In the initial implementation, the equivalent of Match would always take\nthree passes: match forwards to find the end of a match, then match a reversed-copy of the pattern in\nreverse from that ending location in order to find where the match actually starts, and then once more\nwalk forwards from that known starting position to find the actual ending position. However, with\ndotnet/runtime#68199 from [@olsaarik](https://github.com/olsaarik), unless captures are required, it\ncan now be done in only two passes: once forward to find the guaranteed ending location of the\nmatch, and then once in reverse to find its starting location. And dotnet/runtime#65129 from\n[@olsaarik](https://github.com/olsaarik) added captures support, which the original implementation\nalso didn\u2019t have. This captures support adds back a third pass, such that once the bounds of the\nmatch are known, the engine runs the forward pass one more time, but this time with an NFA-based\n\u201csimulation\u201d that is able to record \u201ccapture effects\u201d on transitions. All of this enables the non-\nbacktracking implementation to have the exact same semantics as the backtracking engines, always\nproducing the same matches in the same order with the same capture information. The only\ndifference in this regard is, whereas with the backtracking engines capture groups inside of loops will\nstore all values captured in every iteration of the loop, only the last iteration is stored with the non-\nbacktracking implementation. On top of that, there are a few constructs the non-backtracking", "131", "CHAPTER 11 | Regex", "\fimplementation simply doesn\u2019t support, such that attempting to use any of those will fail when trying\nto construct the Regex, e.g. backreferences and lookarounds.", "Even after its progress as a standalone library from MSR, more than 100 PRs went into making\nRegexOptions.NonBacktracking what it is now in .NET 7, including optimizations like\ndotnet/runtime#70217 from [@olsaarik](https://github.com/olsaarik) that tries to streamline the tight\ninner matching loop at the heart of the DFA (e.g. read the next input character, find the appropriate\ntransition to take, move to the next node, and check information about the node like whether it\u2019s a\nfinal state) and optimizations like dotnet/runtime#65637 from [@veanes](https://github.com/veanes)\nthat optimized the NFA mode to avoid superfluous allocations, caching and reusing list and set\nobjects to make the handling of the lists of states ammortized allocation-free.", "There\u2019s one more set of PRs of performance interest for NonBacktracking. The Regex implementation\nfor taking patterns and turning them into something processable, regardless of which of the multiple\nengines is being used, is essentially a compiler, and as with many compilers, it naturally lends itself to\nrecursive algorithms. In the case of Regex, those algorithms involve walking around trees of regular\nexpression constructs. Recursion ends up being a very handy way of expressing these algorithms, but\nrecursion also suffers from the possibility of stack overflow; essentially it\u2019s using stack space as scratch\nspace, and if it ends up using too much, things go badly. One common approach to dealing with this\nis turning the recursive algorithm into an iterative one, which typically involves using an explicit stack\nof state rather than the implicit one. The nice thing about this is the amount of state you can store is\nlimited only by how much memory you have, as opposed to being limited by your thread\u2019s stack\nspace. The downsides, however, are that it\u2019s typically much less natural to write the algorithms in this\nmanner, and it typically requires allocating heap space for the stack, which then leads to additional\ncomplications if you want to avoid that allocation, such as various kinds of pooling.\ndotnet/runtime#60385 introduces a different approach for Regex, which is then used by\ndotnet/runtime#60786 from [@olsaarik](https://github.com/olsaarik) specifically in the\nNonBacktracking implementation. It still uses recursion, and thus benefits from the expressiveness of\nthe recursive algorithm as well as being able to use stack space and thus avoid additional allocation in\nthe most common cases, but then to avoid stack overflows, it issues explicit checks to ensure we\u2019re\nnot too deep on the stack (.NET has long provided the helpers\nRuntimeHelpers.EnsureSufficientExecutionStack and\nRuntimeHelpers.TryEnsureSufficientExecutionStack for this purpose). If it detects it\u2019s too deep\non the stack, it forks off continued execution into another thread. Hitting this condition is expensive,\nbut it\u2019s very rarely if ever actually hit in practice (e.g. the only time it\u2019s hit in our vast functional tests\nare in the tests explicitly written to stress it), it keeps the code simple, and it keeps the typical cases\nfast. A similar approach is used in other areas of dotnet/runtime, such as in System.Linq.Expressions.", "As was mentioned in my previous blog post about regular expressions, both the backtracking\nimplementations and the non-backtracking implementation have their place. The main benefit of the\nnon-backtracking implementation is predictability: because of the linear processing guarantee, once\nyou\u2019ve constructed the regex, you don\u2019t need to worry about malicious inputs causing worst-case\nbehavior in the processing of your potentially susceptible expressions. This doesn\u2019t mean\nRegexOptions.NonBacktracking is always the fastest; in fact, it\u2019s frequently not.

The simplicity\nof the new APIs likely also misrepresents how much work was necessary to enable them, in particular\nbecause the new APIs all support ReadOnlySpan<char> inputs into the regex engines.", "dotnet/runtime#65473 brings Regex into the span-based era of .NET, overcoming a significant\nlimitation in Regex since spans were introduced back in .NET Core 2.1. Regex has historically been\nbased on processing System.String inputs, and that fact pervades the Regex design and\nimplementation, including the APIs exposed for the extensibility model Regex.CompileToAssembly\nrelied on in .NET Framework (CompileToAssembly is now obsoleted and has never been functional in\n.NET Core). One subtly that relies on the nature of string as the input is how match information is\nreturned to callers. Regex.Match returns a Match object that represents the first match in the input,\nand that Match object exposes a NextMatch method that enables moving to the next match. That\nmeans the Match object needs to store a reference to the input, so that it can be fed back into the\nmatching engine as part of such a NextMatch call. If that input is a string, great, no problem. But if\nthat input is a ReadOnlySpan<char>, that span as a ref struct can\u2019t be stored on the class Match\nobject, since ref structs can only live on the stack and not the heap. That alone would make it a\nchallenge to support spans, but the problem is even more deeply rooted. All of the regex engines rely\non a RegexRunner, a base class that stores on it all of the state necessary to feed into the\nFindFirstChar and Go methods that compose the actual matching logic for the regular expressions\n(these methods contain all of the core code for performing the match, with FindFirstChar being an\noptimization to skip past input positions that couldn\u2019t possibly start a match and then Go performing\nthe actual matching logic). If you look at the internal RegexInterpreter type, which is the engine you\nget when you construct a new Regex(...) without the RegexOptions.Compiled or\nRegexOptions.NonBacktracking flags, it derives from RegexRunner. Similarly, when you use\nRegexOptions.Compiled, it hands off the dynamic methods it reflection emits to a type derived from\nRegexRunner, RegexOptions.NonBacktracking has a SymbolicRegexRunnerFactory that produces\ntypes derived from RegexRunner, and so on. Most relevant here, RegexRunner is public, because the\ntypes generated by the Regex.CompileToAssembly type (and now the regex source generator) include\nones derived from this RegexRunner. Those FindFirstChar and Go methods are thus abstract and\nprotected, and parameterless, because they pick up all the state they need from protected members\non the base class. That includes the string input to process. So what about spans? We could of\ncourse have just called ToString() on an input ReadOnlySpan<char>. That would have been\nfunctionally correct, but would have completely defeated the purpose of accepting spans, and worse,\nwould have been so unexpected as to likely cause consuming apps to be worse performing than they\nwould have without the APIs. Instead, we needed a new approach and new APIs.", "First, we made FindFirstChar and Go virtual instead of abstract. The design that splits these methods\nis largely antiquated, and in particular the forced separation between a stage of processing where you\nfind the next possible location of a match and then a stage where you actually perform the match at\nthat location doesn\u2019t align well with all engines, like the one used by NonBacktracking (which initially\nimplemented FindFirstChar as a nop and had all its logic in Go). Then we added a new virtual Scan\nmethod which, importantly, takes a ReadOnlySpan<char> as a parameter; the span can\u2019t be exposed\nfrom the base RegexRunner and must be passed in. We then implemented FindFirstChar and Go in\nterms of Scan, and made them \u201cjust work.\u201d Then, all of the engines are implemented in terms of that", "133", "CHAPTER 11 | Regex", "\fspan; they no longer need to access the protected RegexRunner.runtext, RegexRunner.runtextbeg,\nand RegexRunner.runtextend members that surface the input; they\u2019re just handed the span, already\nsliced to the input region, and process that.

We can optimize Count further by passing\nadditional information into the engines to let them know how much information they actually need to\ncompute. For example, I noted previously that NonBacktracking is fairly pay-for-play in how much\nwork it needs to do relative to what information it needs to gather.

It does an\nup-front check for cancellation, such that if cancellation was requested prior to the call being made, it\nwill be immediately canceled, but after that check the supplied CancellationToken is effectively\nignored. Over time we\u2019ve tried to stamp out all remaining such cases, but a few stragglers have\nremained. One pernicious case has been with pipes.

On Unix, with named pipes implemented in terms of sockets, if the pipe\nwas opened with PipeOptions.Asynchronous, the implementation would simulate cancellation\nvia polling: rather than simply issuing the Socket.ReceiveAsync/Socket.SendAsync (which\nwasn\u2019t cancelable at the time), it would queue a work item to the ThreadPool, and that work\nitem would run a polling loop, making Socket.Poll calls with a small timeout, checking the\ntoken, and then looping around to do it again until either the Poll indicated the operation\nwould succeed or cancellation was requested.

The code had been performing a stat call in order to determine up front whether the\nsource was actually a directory, in which case the operation would error out. Instead, the PR simply\ntries to open the source file, which it would need to do anyway for the copy operation, and then it\nonly performs that stat if opening the file fails. If opening the file succeeds, the code was already\nperforming an fstat to gather data on the file, such as whether it was seekable; with this change, it\nnow also extracts from the results of that single fstat the source file size, which it then threads\nthrough to the core copy routine, which itself is then able to avoid an fstat syscall it had been\nperforming in order to get the size. Saving those syscalls is great, in particular for very small files\nwhere the overhead of setting up the copy can actually be more expensive than the actual copy of the\nbytes. But the biggest benefit of this PR is that it takes advantage of IOCTL-FICLONERANGE on Linux.\nSome Linux file systems, like XFS and Btrfs, support \u201ccopy-on-write,\u201d which means that rather than\ncopying all of the data to a new file, the file system simply notes that there are two different files\npointing to the same data, sharing the underlying storage. This makes the \u201ccopy\u201d super fast, since\nnothing actually needs to be copied and instead the file system just needs to update some\nbookkeeping; plus, less space is consumed on disk, since there\u2019s just a single store of the data.

In\nprevious releases, a lot of effort was focused on the lower layers of the networking stack, e.g. .NET 5\nsaw a significant investment in improving the performance of sockets on Linux. In .NET 7, much of the\neffort is above sockets.", "That said, there were some interesting performance improvements in sockets itself for .NET 7. One of\nthe more interesting is dotnet/runtime#64770, which revamped how some synchronization is handled\ninside of SocketsAsyncEventArgs. As background, in the early days of networking in .NET Framework,\nasynchrony was enabled via Begin/End methods (the \u201cAPM\u201d pattern). This pattern is not only\ncomplicated to use well, it\u2019s relatively inefficient, resulting in allocation for every single operation\nperformed (at a minimum for the IAsyncResult object that\u2019s returned from the BeginXx method). To\nhelp make networking operations more efficient, SocketsAsyncEventArgs was introduced.\nSocketsAsyncEventArgs is a reusable class you allocate to hold all of the state associated with\nasynchronous operations: allocate one, pass it to various async methods (e.g. ReceiveAsync), and\nthen completion events are raised on the SocketAsyncEventArgs instance when the operation\ncompletes. It can be quite efficient when used correctly, but it\u2019s also complicated to use correctly. In\nsubsequent releases, Task-based and ValueTask-based APIs were released; these have the efficiency\nof SocketAsyncEventArgs and the ease-of-use of async/await, and are the recommended starting\npoint for all Socket-based asynchronous programming today. They have the efficiency of\nSocketAsyncEventArgs because they\u2019re actually implemented as a thin veneer on top of it under the\ncovers, and so while most code these days isn\u2019t written to use SocketAsyncEventArgs directly, it\u2019s still\nvery relevant from a performance perspective.", "SocketAsyncEventArgs on Windows is implemented to use winsock and overlapped I/O. When you\ncall an async method like ValueTask<Socket> Socket.AcceptAsync(CancellationToken), that grabs\nan internal SocketAsyncEventArgs and issues an AcceptAsync on it, which in turn gets a\nNativeOverlapped* from the ThreadPoolBoundHandle associated with the socket, and uses it to issue\nthe native AcceptEx call. When that handle is initially created, we set the\nFILE_SKIP_COMPLETION_PORT_ON_SUCCESS completion notification mode on the socket; use of this\nwas introduced in earlier releases of .NET Core, and it enables a significant number of socket\noperations, in particular sends and receives, to complete synchronously, which in turn saves\nunnecessary trips through the thread pool, unnecessary unwinding of async state machines, and so\non. But it also causes a condundrum. There are some operations we want to perform associated with\nasynchronous operation but that have additional overhead, such as registering for the cancellation of\nthose operations, and we don\u2019t want to pay the cost of doing them if the operation is going to\ncomplete synchronously. That means we really want to delay performing such registration until after\nwe\u2019ve made the native call and discovered the operation didn\u2019t complete synchronously\u2026 but at that\npoint we\u2019ve already initiated the operation, so if it doesn\u2019t complete synchronously, then we\u2019re now in", "173", "CHAPTER 16 | Networking", "\fa potential race condition, where our code that\u2019s still setting up the asynchronous operation is racing\nwith it potentially completing in a callback on another thread. Fun. SocketAsyncEventArgs handled\nthis race condition with a spin lock; the theory was that contention would be incredibly rare, as the\nvast majority cases would either be the operation completing synchronously (in which case there\u2019s no\nother thread involved) or asynchronously with enough of a delay that the small amount of additional\nwork performed by the initiating thread would have long ago completed by the time the\nasynchronous operation completed. And for the most part, that was true. However, it turns out that\nit\u2019s actually much more common than expected for certain kinds of operations, like Accepts. Accepts\nend up almost always completing asynchronously, but if there\u2019s already a pending connection,\ncompleting asynchronously almost immediately, which then induces this race condition to happen\nmore frequently and results in more contention on the spin locks. Contention on a spin lock is\nsomething you really want to avoid. And in fact, for a particular benchmark, this spin lock showed up\nas the cause for an almost 300% slowdown in requests-per-second (RPS) for a benchmark that used a\ndedicated connection per request (e.g. with every response setting \u201cConnection: close\u201d).\ndotnet/runtime#64770 changed the synchronization mechanism to no longer involve a spin lock;\ninstead, it maintains a simple gate implemented as an Interlocked.CompareExchange. If the initiating\nthread gets to the gate first, from that point on the operation is considered asynchronous and any\nadditional work is handled by the completing callback. Conversely, if the callback gets to the gate first,\nthe initiating thread treats the operation as if it completed synchronously. This not only avoids one of\nthe threads spinning while waiting for the other to make forward progress, it also increases the\nnumber of operations that end up being handled as synchronous, which in turn reduces other costs\n(e.g. the code awaiting the task returned from this operation doesn\u2019t need to hook up a callback and\nexit, and can instead itself continue executing synchronously). The impact of this is difficult to come\nup with a microbenchmark for, but it can have meaningful impact for loaded Windows servers that\nend up accepting significant numbers of connections in steady state.", "A more-easily quantifiable change around sockets is dotnet/runtime#71090, which improves the\nperformance of SocketAddress.Equals. A SocketAddress is the serialized form of an EndPoint, with\na byte[] containing the sequence of bytes that represent the address. Its Equals method, used to\ndetermine whether to SocketAddress instances are the same, looped over that byte[] byte-by-byte.\nNot only is such code gratuitous when there are now helpers available like SequenceEqual for\ncomparing spans, doing it byte-by-byte is also much less efficient than the vectorized implementation\nin SequenceEqual.

This represents a\nsignificant portion of the time required to establish a new connection. For a client that might\ndisconnect from a server and then reconnect later, as is fairly common in distributed applications, TLS\nresumption allows a client and server to essentially pick up where they left off, with the client and/or\nserver storing some amount of information about recent connections and using that information to\nresume. Windows SChannel provides default support for TLS resumption, and thus the Windows\nimplementation of SslStream (which is built on SChannel) has long had support for TLS resumption.\nBut OpenSSL\u2019s model requires additional code to enable TLS resumption, and such code wasn\u2019t\npresent in the Linux implementation of SslStream. With dotnet/runtime#57079 and\ndotnet/runtime#63030, .NET 7 adds server-side support for TLS resumption (using the variant that\ndoesn\u2019t require storing recent connection state on the server), and with dotnet/runtime#64369, .NET 7\nadds client-side support (which does require storing additional state).

significant improvement for SslStream in .NET 7 is support for OCSP stapling. When a client\nhandshakes with the server and the server shares its certificate, a client that cares about validating it\u2019s\ntalking to exactly who it intended to talk to needs to validate that certificate. In the days of yore, such\nvalidation was done with certificate revocation lists (CRL), where periodically the client would\ndownload a giant list of certificates known to be revoked. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is\na newer protocol and mechanism that enables a client to get real-time information about a certificate;\nwhile the client handshakes with the server and the server sends the client its certificate, the client\nthen connects to an \u201cOCSP responder\u201d and sends it a request to determine whether the certificate is\nconsidered good. OCSP has multiple issues of its own, however. In particular, it places a significant\nload on these OCSP responder servers, with every client making a real-time request to it about every\ncertificate encountered, and also potentially significantly increasing the time it takes the client to\nestablish a connection. OCSP stapling offers a solution to this. Rather than a client issuing a request to", "177", "CHAPTER 16 | Networking", "\fthe OCSP responder, the server itself contacts the OCSP responder and gets a signed ticket from the\nOCSP responder stating that the server\u2019s certificate is good and will be for some period of time. When\na client handshakes with the server, the server can then \u201cstaple\u201d (include) this signed ticket as part of\nits response to the client, giving the validation to the client directly rather than the client needing to\nmake a separate roundtrip to the OCSP responder. This reduces overheads for everyone involved.\ndotnet/runtime#67011 adds support for OCSP stapling to SslStream client usage on Linux, with\ndotnet/runtime#69833 adding the Linux server-side counterpart, and dotnet/runtime#71570 adds\nclient-side support for Windows.", "The aforementioned changes are primarily about the performance of opening a connection.\nAdditional work has been done to improve that further in other ways. dotnet/runtime#69527 gets rid\nof allocations associated with several SafeHandle instances that were being created unnecessarily on\nLinux as part of establishing a TLS connection. This highlights the benefits of doing profiling on\nmultiple platforms, as while these SafeHandles were necessary in the Windows implementation, they\nwere fairly meaningless in the Linux implementation (due to differences between SChannel and\nOpenSSL), and were only brought along for the ride because of how the platform-abstraction layer\n(PAL) was defined to reuse most of the SslStream code across platforms. And dotnet/runtime#68188\navoids several collections allocated as part of the TLS handshake. This one is particularly interesting as\nit\u2019s come up multiple times in the past in various libraries. Imagine you have a lazily initialized\nproperty like this:", "private List<T>? _items;\npublic List<T> Items => _items ??= new List<T>();", "And then some code in the same implementation comes along and wants to read the contents of\nthese items. That code might look like:", "if (Items.Count > 0) { ... }", "but the very act of accessing Items just to check its count forces the collection into existence (with a 0\nCount). If the code instead checks:", "if (_items is List<T> items && items.Count > 0) { ... }", "It can save that unnecessary collection allocation. The approach is made even simpler with C# pattern\nmatching:", "if (_items is { Count: > 0 }) items) { ... }", "This is one of those things that\u2019s incredibly obvious once you \u201csee\u201d it and realize what\u2019s happening,\nbut you often miss until it jumps out at you in a profiler.", "dotnet/runtime#69098 is another good example of how profiling can lead to insights about\nallocations that can be removed. Application-Layer Protocol Negotation (ALPN) allows code\nestablishing a TLS connection to piggy-back on the roundtrips that are being used for the TLS\nhandshake anyway to negotiate some higher-level protocol that will end up being used as well. A very\ncommon use-case, for example, is for an HTTPS client/server to negotiate which version of HTTP\nshould be used. This information is exposed from SslStream as an SslApplicationProtocol struct\nreturned from its NegotiatedApplicationProtocol property, but as the actual negotiated protocol\ncan be arbitrary data, SslApplicationProtocol just wraps a byte[]. The implementation had been", "178", "CHAPTER 16 | Networking", "\fdutifully allocating a byte[] to hold the bytes passed around as part of ALPN, since we need such a\nbyte[] to store in the SslApplicationProtocol. But while the byte data can be arbitrary, in practice\nby far the most common byte sequences are equivalent to \u201chttp/1.1\u201d for HTTP/1.1, \u201ch2\u201d for HTTP/2,\nand \u201ch3\u201d for HTTP/3. Thus, it makes sense to special-case those values and use a reusable cached\nbyte[] singleton when one of those values is needed. If SslApplicationProtocol exposed the\nunderlying byte[] directly to consumers, we\u2019d be hesitant to use such singletons, as doing so would\nmean that if code wrote into the byte[] it would potentially be changing the value for other\nconsumers in the same process. However, SslApplicationProtocol exposes it as a\nReadOnlyMemory<byte>, which is only mutable via unsafe code (using the\nMemoryMarshal.TryGetArray method), and once you\u2019re employing unsafe code to do \u201cbad\u201d things,\"\nall bets are off anyway. dotnet/runtime#63674 also removes allocations related to ALPN, in this case\navoiding the need for a byte[] allocation on Linux when setting the negotiated protocol on a client\nSslStream. It uses stack memory instead of an array allocation for protocols up to 256 bytes in length,\nwhich is way larger than any in known use, and thus doesn\u2019t bother to do anything fancy for the\nfallback path, which will never be used in practice. And dotnet/runtime#69103 further avoids ALPN-\nrelated allocations and work on Windows by entirely skipping some unnecessary code paths: various\nmethods can be invoked multiple times during a TLS handshake, but even though the ALPN-related\nwork only needed to happen once the first time, the code wasn\u2019t special-casing it and was instead\nrepeating the work over and over.", "Everything discussed thus far was about establishing connections. What about the performance of\nreading and writing on that connection? Improvements have been made there, too, in particular\naround memory management and asynchrony. But first we need some context.", "When async/await were first introduced, Task and Task<TResult> were the only game in town; while\nthe pattern-based mechanism the compiler supports for arbitrary \u201ctask-like\u201d types enabled async\nmethods to return other types, in practice it was only tasks (which also followed our guidance). We\nsoon realized, however, that a significant number of calls to a significant number of commonly-used\nasync APIs would actually complete synchronously. Consider, for example, a method like\nMemoryStream.ReadAsync: MemoryStream is backed entirely by an in-memory buffer, so even though\nthe operation is \u201casync,\u201d every call to it completes synchronously, as the operation can be performed\nwithout doing any potentially long-running I/O. Or consider FileStream.ReadAsync. By default\nFileStream employs its own internal buffer. If you issue a call to FileStream.ReadAsync with your\nown buffer and ask for only, say, 16 bytes, under the covers FileStream.ReadAsync will issue the\nactual native call with its own much larger buffer, which by default is 4K. The first time you issue your\n16-byte read, actual I/O will be required and the operation is likely to complete asynchronously. But\nthe next 255 calls you make could simply end up draining the remainder of the data read into that 4K\nbuffer, in which case 255 of the 256 \u201casync\u201d operations actually complete synchronously. If the\nmethod returns a Task<int>, every one of those 255 synchronously-completing calls could still end\nup allocating a Task<int>, just to hand back the int that\u2019s already known. Various techniques were\ndevised to minimize this, e.g. if the int is one of a few well-known values (e.g. -1 through 8), then the\nasync method infrastructure will hand back a pre-allocated and cached Task<int> instance for that\nvalue, and various stream implementations (including FileStream) would cache the previously-\nreturned Task<int> and hand it back for the next call as well if the next call yielded exactly the same\nnumber of bytes. But those optimizations don\u2019t fully mitigate the issue. Instead, we introduced the\nValueTask<TResult> struct and provided the necessary \u201cbuilder\u201d to allow async methods to return", "179", "CHAPTER 16 | Networking", "\fthem. ValueTask<TResult> was simply a discrimated union between a TResult and Task<TResult>. If\nan async method completed asynchronously (or if it failed synchronously), well, it would simply\nallocate the Task<TResult> as it otherwise would have and return that task wrapped in a\nValueTask<TResult>. But if the method actually completed synchronously and successfully, it would\ncreate a ValueTask<TResult> that just wrapped the resulting TResult, which then eliminates all\nallocation overhead for the synchronously-completing case. Yay, everyone\u2019s happy. Well, almost\neveryone. For really hot paths, especially those lower down in the stack that many other code paths\nbuild on top of, it can also be beneficial to avoid the allocations even for the asynchronously\ncompleting case. To address that, .NET Core 2.1 saw the introduction of the\nIValueTaskSource<TResult> interface along with enabling ValueTask<TResult> to wrap an instance\nof that interface in addition to a TResult or a Task<TResult> (at which point it also became\nmeaningful to introduce a non-generic ValueTask and the associated IValueTaskSource). Someone\ncan implement this interface with whatever behaviors they want, although we codified the typical\nimplementation of the core async logic into the ManualResetValueTaskSourceCore helper struct,\nwhich is typically embedded into some object, with the interface methods delegating to\ncorresponding helpers on the struct. Why would someone want to do this? Most commonly, it\u2019s to be\nable to reuse the same instance implementing this interface over and over and over. So, for example,\nSocket exposes a ValueTask<int> ReceiveAsync method, and it caches a single instance of an\nIValueTaskSource<int> implementation for use with such receives. As long as you only ever have\none receive pending on a given socket at a time (which is the 99.999% case), every ReceiveAsync call\nwill either return a ValueTask<int> wrapped around an int value or a ValueTask<int> wrapped\naround that reusable IValueTaskSource<int>, making all use of ReceiveAsync ammortized\nallocation-free (there is another instance used for SendAsync, such that you can have a concurrent\nread and write on the socket and still avoid allocations).

I find this one\nparticularly interesting, as it highlights a new and powerful C# 11 and .NET 7 feature: static abstract\nmembers in interfaces.

Thus, we really want to avoid having to\nduplicate all of the code paths, once for synchronous work and once for asynchronous work, when in\nreality the only place that bifurcation is needed is at the leaves where calls into the underlying Stream\nare made to perform the actual I/O. Historically, we\u2019ve had two different mechanisms we\u2019ve employed\nin dotnet/runtime for handling such unification.

One of\nthe things HttpHeaders needs to deal with is that there\u2019s no defined limit to the number of headers\nthat can be sent with an HTTP request or response (though in order to mitigate possible denial of\nservice attacks, the implementation has a configurable limit for how many bytes of headers are\naccepted from the server), and thus it needs to be able to handle an arbitrary number of them and to\ndo so with efficient access. As such, for the longest time HttpHeaders has used a Dictionary<,> to\nprovide O(1) lookup into these headers. However, while it\u2019s valid to have large numbers of headers,\nit\u2019s most common to only have a handful, and for only a few items, the overheads involved in a hash\ntable like Dictionary<> can be more than just storing the elements in an array and doing an O(N)\nlookup by doing a linear search through all the elements (algorithmic complexity ignores the\n\u201cconstants\u201d involved, so for a small N, an O(N) algorithm might be much faster and lighterweight than\nan O(1)). This PR takes advantage of that and teaches HttpHeaders how to use either an array or a\ndictionary; for common numbers of headers (the current threshold is 64), it just uses an array, and in\nthe rare case where that threshold is exceeded, it graduates into a dictionary. This reduces the\nallocation in HttpHeader in all but the most niche cases while also making it faster for lookups.", "Another header-related size reduction comes in dotnet/runtime#64105.

This\nHeaderDescriptor accomodated both known headers and custom headers by having two fields, one\nfor known header data (which would be null for custom headers) and one for the header name.\nInstead, this PR employs a relatively-common technique of having a single object field that then\nstores either the known header information or the name, since the known header information itself\nincludes the name, and thus we don\u2019t need the duplication.

The canonical implementation of IWebProxy provided in the core libraries\nis the aptly named WebProxy. WebProxy is fairly simple: you give it a proxy Uri, and then calls to\nGetProxy return that proxy Uri if the destination isn\u2019t to be bypassed. Whether a Uri should be\nbypassed is determined by two things (assuming a non-null proxy Uri was provided): did the\nconstructor of the WebProxy specify that \u201clocal\u201d destinations should be bypassed (and if so, is this\ndestination local), or does this destination address match any of any number of regular expressions\nprovided. As it turns out, this latter aspect has been relatively slow and allocation-heavy in all previous\nreleases of .NET, for two reasons: every call to check whether an address was bypassed was recreating\na Regex instance for every supplied regular expression, and every call to check whether an address\nwas bypassed was deriving a new string from the Uri to use to match against the Regex.

That\u2019s the case with\ndotnet/runtime#63459 from [@chrisdcmoore](https://github.com/chrisdcmoore), which addresses a\nlong-standing issue with the asynchronous methods on the popular XmlReader. When XmlReader was\noriginally written, whoever developed it chose a fairly common buffer size to be used for read\noperations, namely 4K or 8K chars depending on various conditions. When XmlReader later gained\nasynchronous reading functionality, for whatever reason a much, much larger buffer size of 64K chars\nwas selected (presumably in hopes of minimizing the number of asynchronous operations that would\nneed to be employed, but the actual rationale is lost to history). A key problem with such a buffer size,\nbeyond it leading to a lot of allocation, is the allocation it produces typically ends up on the Large\nObject Heap (LOH). By default, under the expectation that really large objects are long-lived, objects\ngreater than 85K bytes are allocated into the LOH, which is treated as part of Gen 2, and that makes\nsuch allocation if not long-lived even more expensive in terms of overall impact on the system. Well,\n64K chars is 128K bytes, which puts it squarely above that threshold. This PR lowers the size from 64K\nchars to 32K chars, putting it below the threshold (and generally reducing allocation pressure, how\nmuch memory needs to be zero\u2019d, etc). While it\u2019s still a very large allocation, and in the future we\ncould look at pooling the buffer or employing a smaller one (e.g. no different from what\u2019s done for\nthe synchronous APIs), this simple one-number change alone makes a substantial difference for\nshorter input documents (while not perceivably negatively impacting larger ones).", "private readonly XmlReaderSettings _settings = new XmlReaderSettings { Async = true };\nprivate MemoryStream _stream;", "[Params(10, 1_000_000)]\npublic int ItemCount;", "[GlobalSetup]\npublic void Setup()\n{\n_stream = new MemoryStream();\nusing XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create(_stream);\nwriter.WriteStartElement(\"Items\");\nfor (var i = 0; i < ItemCount; i++)\n{\nwriter.WriteStartElement($\"Item{i}\");\nwriter.WriteEndElement();\n}\nwriter.WriteEndElement();", "193", "CHAPTER 18 | XML", "\f}", "[Benchmark]\npublic async Task XmlReader_ReadAsync()\n{\n_stream.Position = 0;\nusing XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(_stream, _settings);\nwhile (await reader.ReadAsync());\n}", "Method", "Runtime", "ItemCount", "Mean  Ratio", "Allocated", "XmlReader_ReadAsync", ".NET 6.0", "XmlReader_ReadAsync", ".NET 7.0", "10", "10", "42.344 us", "1.00", "195.94 KB", "9.992 us", "0.23", "99.94 KB", "XmlReader_ReadAsync", ".NET 6.0", "1000000", "XmlReader_ReadAsync", ".NET 7.0", "1000000", "340,382.953\nus", "333,417.347\nus", "1.00", "0.98", "101790.34\nKB", "101804.45\nKB", "Alloc\nRatio", "1.00", "0.51", "1.00", "1.00", "XmlReader and XmlWriter saw other allocation-related improvements as well. dotnet/runtime#60076\nfrom [@kronic](https://github.com/kronic) improved the ReadOnlyTernaryTree internal type that\u2019s\nused when XmlOutputMethod.Html is specified in the XmlWriterSettings.

In some\ncases, seeing places this analyzer fires can also inspire changes that avoid any use of enumerators.
