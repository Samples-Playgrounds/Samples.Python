[' \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPerformance Improvements  \n in .NET 7  \n \n \nStephen Toub  \nPartner Software Engineer, .NET  \nMicrosoft  \n \n  Introduction  \nA year ago, I published Performance Improvements in .NET 6 , following on the heels of similar posts \nfor .NET 5 , .NET Core 3.0 , .NET Core 2.1 , and .NET Core 2.0 . I enjoy writing these posts and love \nreading developers’ responses to them. One comment in particular last year resonated with me. The \ncommen', 'ter cited the Die Ha rd movie quote, “‘When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he \nwept for there were no more worlds to conquer’,” and questioned whether .NET performance \nimprovements were similar. Has the well run dry? Are there no more “[performance] worlds to \nconquer” ? I’m a bit giddy to say that, even with how fast .NET 6 is, .NET 7 definitively highlights how \nmuch more can be and has been done.  \nAs with previous versions of .NET,', ' performance is a key focus that pervades the entire stack, whether it \nbe features created  explicitly for performance or non -performance -related features that are still \ndesigned and implemented with performance keenly in mind. And now that a .NET 7 release \ncandidate is just around the corner, it’s a good time to discuss much of it. Over the cou rse of the last \nyear, every time I’ve reviewed a PR that might positively impact performance, I’', 've copied that link to a \njournal I maintain for the purposes of writing this post. When I sat down to write this a few weeks ago, \nI was faced with a list of alm ost 1000 performance -impacting PRs (out of more than 7000 PRs that \nwent into the release), and I’m excited to share approximately 500 of them here with you.  \nOne thought before we dive in. In past years, I’ve received the odd piece of negative feedback abou t \nthe length of some of m', 'y performance -focused write -ups, and while I disagree with the criticism, I \nrespect the opinion. So, this year, consider this a “choose your own adventure.” If you’re here just \nlooking for a super short adventure, one that provides  the top -level summary and a core message to \ntake away from your time here, I’m happy to oblige:  \nTL;DR: .NET 7 is fast. Really fast. A thousand performance -impacting PRs went into runtime and core \nlibraries t', 'his release, never mind all the improvements in ASP.NET Core and Windows Forms and \nEntity Framework and beyond. It’s the fastest .NET ever. If your manager asks you why your project \nshould upgrade to .NET 7, you can say “in addition to all the new functionality in the release, .NET 7 is \nsuper fast.”  \nOr, if you prefer a slightly longer adventure, one filled with interesting nuggets of performance -\nfocused data, consider skimming through the ', 'post, looking for the small code snippets and \ncorresponding tables showing a wealth of measurable performance improve ments. At that point, you, \ntoo, may walk away with your head held high and my thanks.  \nBoth noted paths achieve one of my primary goals for spending the time to write these posts, to \nhighlight the greatness of the next release and to encourage everyone to g ive it a try. But, I have other \ngoals for these posts, too. I want ev', 'eryone interested to walk away from this post with an upleveled \nunderstanding of how .NET is implemented, why various decisions were made, tradeoffs that were \nevaluated, techniques that w ere employed, algorithms that were considered, and valuable tools and \napproaches that were utilized to make .NET even faster than it was previously. I want developers to \nlearn from our own learnings and find ways to apply this new -found knowledge to their o', 'wn \ncodebases, thereby further increasing the overall performance of code in the ecosystem. I want \ndevelopers to take an extra beat, think about reaching for a profiler the next time they’re working on a gnarly problem, think about looking at the source fo r the component they’re using in order to better \nunderstand how to work with it, and think about revisiting previous assumptions and decisions to \ndetermine whether they’re still accurate and', ' appropriate. And I want developers to be excited at the \nprospect of submitting PRs to improve .NET not only for themselves but for every developer around \nthe globe using .NET. If any of that sounds interesting, then I encourage you to choose the last \nadventure: prepare a carafe of your favorite hot beverage, get comfort able, and please enjoy.   \ni Contents   \nContents

To make it easy for you to follow \nalong with your own validation, I have a very simple setup for the benchmarks I use. Create a n ew C# \nproject:  \ndotnet new console -o benchmarks  \ncd benchmarks  \nYour new benchmarks  directory will contain a benchmarks.csproj  file and a Program.cs  file. Replace \nthe contents of benchmarks.csproj  with this:  \n<Project  Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk" > \n \n  <PropertyGroup>  \n    <Outp', 'utType> Exe</OutputType>  \n    <TargetFrameworks> net7.0;net6.0 </TargetFrameworks>  \n    <LangVersion> Preview </LangVersion>  \n    <AllowUnsafeBlocks> true </AllowUnsafeBlocks>  \n    <ServerGarbageCollection> true </ServerGarbageCollection>  \n  </PropertyGroup>  \n \n  <ItemGroup>  \n    <PackageReference  Include= "benchmarkdotnet"  Version= "0.13.2"  /> \n  </ItemGroup>  \n \n</Project>  \nand the contents of Program.cs  with this:  \nusing Benchmark', 'DotNet. Attributes ; \nusing BenchmarkDotNet. Running; \nusing Microsoft. Win32; \nusing System; \nusing System.Buffers; \nusing System.Collections .Generic; \nusing System.Collections .Immutable ; \nusing System.ComponentModel ; \nusing System.Diagnostics ; \nusing System.IO; \nusing System.IO.Compression ; \nusing System.IO.MemoryMappedFiles ; \nusing System.IO.Pipes; \nusing System.Linq; \nusing System.Net; \nusing System.Net.Http; \nusing System.Net.Http.Hea', 'ders; \nusing System.Net.Security ; \nusing System.Net.Sockets; \nusing System.Numerics ;  \n2 CHAPTER 1 | Setup  \n using System.Reflection ; \nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices ; \nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices ; \nusing System.Runtime.Intrinsics ; \nusing System.Security .Authentication ; \nusing System.Security .Cryptography ; \nusing System.Security .Cryptography .X509Certificates ; \nusing System.Text; \nusing System.Text.Json; \nusing System.', 'Text.RegularExpressions ; \nusing System.Threading ; \nusing System.Threading .Tasks; \nusing System.Xml; \n \n[MemoryDiagnoser (displayGenColumns: false)] \n[DisassemblyDiagnoser]  \n[HideColumns ("Error", "StdDev" , "Median" , "RatioSD" )] \npublic partial class Program \n{ \n    static void Main(string[] args) => \nBenchmarkSwitcher. FromAssembly (typeof(Program). Assembly ).Run(args); \n \n    // ... copy [Benchmark]s here  \n} \nFor each benchmark included', " in this write -up, you can then just copy and paste the code into thi s test \nclass, and run the benchmarks. For example, to run a benchmark comparing performance on .NET 6 \nand .NET 7, do:  \ndotnet run -c Release -f net6.0 --filter '**' --runtimes net6.0 net7.0  \nThis command says “build the benchmarks in release configuration ta rgeting the .NET 6 surface area, \nand then run all of the benchmarks on both .NET 6 and .NET 7.” Or to run just on .", "NET 7:  \ndotnet run -c Release -f net7.0 --filter '**' --runtimes net7.0  \nwhich instead builds targeting the .NET 7 surface area and then only r uns once against .NET 7. You \ncan do this on any of Windows, Linux, or macOS. Unless otherwise called out (e.g.  where the \nimprovements are specific to Unix and I run the benchmarks on Linux), the results I share were \nrecorded on Windows 11 64 -bit but aren’t  Windows -specific and should show similar", ' relative \ndifferences on the other operating systems as well.  \nThe release of the first .NET 7 release candidate is right around the corner. All of the measurements in \nthis post were gathered with a recent daily build  of .NET 7 RC1.  \nAlso, my standard caveat: These are microbenchmarks. It is expected that different hardware, different \nversions of operating systems, a nd the way in which the wind is currently blowing can affect the \nnumbers ', 'involved. Your mileage may vary.   \n3 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n CHAPTER  2 \nJIT \nI’d like to kick off a discussion of performance improvements in the Just -In-Time (JIT) compiler by \ntalking about something that itself isn’t actually a performance improvement. Being able to \nunderstand exactly what assembly code is generated by the JIT is critical  when fine -tuning lower -level, \nperformance -sensitive code. There are multiple ways to get at that assem', 'bly code. The online tool \nsharplab.io  is incredibly useful  for this (thanks to [@ashmind](https://github.com/ashmind) for this \ntool); however it currently only targets a single release, so as I write this I’m onl y able to see the \noutput for .NET 6, which makes it difficult to use for A/B comparisons. godbolt.org  is also valuable for \nthis, with C# support added in compiler -explorer/compiler -explorer#3168  from \n[@hez2010](https://github.', 'com/hez2010), with similar limitations. The most flexible solutions involve \ngetting at that assembly code locally, as it enables comparing whatever ver sions or local builds you \ndesire with whatever configurations and switches set that you need.  \nOne common approach is to use the [DisassemblyDiagnoser]  in benchmarkdotnet. Simply slap the \n[DisassemblyDiagnoser]  attribute onto your test class: benchmarkdotne t will find the assembly code \ngen', 'erated for your tests and some depth of functions they call, and dump out the found assembly \ncode in a human -readable form. For example, if I run this test:  \nusing BenchmarkDotNet. Attributes ; \nusing BenchmarkDotNet. Running; \nusing System; \n \n[DisassemblyDiagnoser]  \npublic partial class Program \n{ \n    static void Main(string[] args) => \nBenchmarkSwitcher. FromAssembly (typeof(Program). Assembly ).Run(args); \n \n    private int _a = 42, _b =', " 84; \n \n    [Benchmark]  \n    public int Min() => Math. Min(_a, _b);  \n} \nwith:  \ndotnet run -c Release -f net7.0 --filter '**'  \nin addition to doing all of its normal test execution and timing, benchmarkdotnet also outputs a \nProgram-asm.md  file that contains this:  \n; Program.Min()  \n       mov       eax,[rcx+8]  \n       mov       edx,[rcx+0C]  \n       cmp       eax,edx   \n4 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n        jg        short M00_L01  \n       mov      ", ' edx,eax  \nM00_L00:  \n       mov       eax,edx  \n       ret \nM00_L01:  \n       jmp       short M00_L00  \n; Total bytes of code 17  \nPretty neat. Th is support was recently improved further in dotnet/benchmarkdotnet#2072 , which \nallows passing a filter list on the command -line to benchmarkdotnet to tell it exactly which methods’ \nassembly code should be dumped.  \nIf you can get your hands on a “debug” or “checked” build of the .NET runtime (“che', 'cked” is a build \nthat has optimizations enabled but also still includes asserts), and specifically of clrjit.dll, another \nvaluable approach is to set an environment variable that causes the JIT itself to spit out a human -\nreadable description of all of the assembly code it emits. This can be used with any kind of \napplication, as it’s part of the JIT itself rather than part of any speci fic tool or other environment, it \nsupports showing the c', 'ode the JIT generates each time it generates code (e.g.  if it first compiles a \nmethod without optimization and then later recompiles it with optimization), and overall it’s the most \naccurate picture o f the assembly code as it comes “straight from the horses mouth,” as it were. The \n(big) downside of course is that it requires a non -release build of the runtime, which typically means \nyou need to build it yourself from the sources in the dotn', 'et/runtime  repo.  \n… until .NET 7, that is. As of dotnet/runtime#73365 , this assembly dumping support is now available in \nrelease builds as well, which me ans it’s simply part of .NET 7 and you don’t need anything special to \nuse it. To see this, try creating a simple “hello world” app like:  \nusing System; \n \nclass Program \n{ \n    public static void Main() => Console. WriteLine ("Hello, world!" ); \n} \nand building it ( e.g. dotnet build -c Re', 'lease ). Then, set the DOTNET_JitDisasm  environment \nvariable to the name of the method we care about, in this case “Main” (the exact syntax allowed is \nmore permissive and allows for some use of wildcards, optional namespace and class names, etc.). As \nI’m using PowerShell, that means:  \n$env:DOTNET_JitDisasm="Main"  \nand then running the app. You should see code like this output to the console:  \n; Assembly listing for method Program:Main()  \n', '; Emitting BLENDED_CODE for X64 CPU with AVX - Windows \n; Tier-0 compilation  \n; MinOpts code  \n; rbp based frame  \n; partially interruptible  \n \nG_M000_IG01:                ;; offset=0000H  \n       55                   push     rbp  \n       4883EC20             sub      rsp, 32   \n5 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n        488D6C2420           lea      rbp, [rsp+20H]  \n \nG_M000_IG02:                ;; offset=000AH  \n       48B9D820400A8E010000 mov      rcx, 0x', '18E0A4020D8  \n       488B09               mov      rcx, gword ptr [rcx]  \n       FF1583B31000         call     [Console:WriteLine(String)]  \n       90                   nop \n \nG_M000_IG03:                ;; offset=001EH  \n       4883C420             add      rsp, 32  \n       5D                   pop      rbp  \n       C3                   ret  \n \n; Total bytes of code 36  \n \nHello, world!  \nThis is immeasurably helpful for perf ormance analysis an', 'd tuning, even for questions as simple as “did \nmy function get inlined” or “is this code I expected to be optimized away actually getting optimized \naway.” Throughout the rest of this post, I’ll include assembly snippets generated by one of these two \nmechanisms, in order to help exemplify concepts.  \nNote that it can sometimes be a little confusing figuring out what name to specify as the value for \nDOTNET_JitDisasm , especially when the method', ' you care about is one that the C# compiler names or \nname mangles (since the JIT only sees the IL and metadata, not the original C#), e.g.  the name of the \nentry point method for a program with top -level statements, the names of local functions, etc. To \nboth help with this and to provide a really valuable top-level view of the work the JIT is doing, .NET 7 \nalso supports the new DOTNET_JitDisasmSummary  environment variable (introduced in \ndo', 'tnet/runtime#74090 ). Set that to “1”, and it’ll result i n the JIT emitting a line every time it compiles a \nmethod, including the name of that method which is copy/pasteable with DOTNET_JitDisasm . This \nfeature is useful in -and-of-itself, however, as it can quickly highlight for you what’s being compiled, \nwhen, a nd with what settings. For example, if I set the environment variable and then run a “hello, \nworld” console app, I get this outpu', 't:  \n   1: JIT compiled CastHelpers:StelemRef(Array,long,Object) [Tier1, IL size=88, code \nsize=93]  \n   2: JIT compiled CastHelpers :LdelemaRef(Array,long,long):byref [Tier1, IL size=44, code \nsize=44]  \n   3: JIT compiled SpanHelpers:IndexOfNullCharacter(byref):int [Tier1, IL size=792, code \nsize=388]  \n   4: JIT compiled Program:Main() [Tier0, IL size=11, code size=36]  \n   5: JIT compiled A SCIIUtility:NarrowUtf16ToAscii(long,long,long):long ', '[Tier0, IL \nsize=490, code size=1187]  \nHello, world!  \nWe can see for “hello, world” there’s only 5 methods that actually get JIT compiled. There are of \ncourse many more methods that get executed as part of a  simple “hello, world,” but almost all of \nthem have precompiled native code available as part of the “Ready To Run” (R2R)  images of the core \nlibraries. The first three in the above list ( StelemRef , LdelemaRef , and IndexOfNullCharacte', 'r ) don’t \nbecause they explicitly opted -out of R2R via use of the \n[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveOptimization)]  attribute (despite the name, this \nattribute should almost never be used, and is only used for very specific reasons in a few very specific \nplaces in the core libraries). Then there’s our Main  method. And lastly there’s the NarrowUtf16ToAscii   \n6 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n method, which  doesn’t have R2R code, either, due to usi', 'ng the variable -width Vector<T>  (more on \nthat later). Every other method that’s run doesn’t require JIT’ing. If we instead first set the \nDOTNET_ReadyToRun  environment variable to 0, the list is much longer, and giv es you a very good \nsense of what the JIT needs to do on startup (and why technologies like R2R are important for startup \ntime). Note how many methods get compiled before “hello, world” is output:  \n   1: JIT compiled CastHelpers', ':StelemRef(Array,long,Object) [Tier1, IL size=88, code \nsize=93]  \n   2: JIT compiled

way, let’s move on to actual performance improvements, starting with on -stack \nreplacement.  \nOn-Stack Replacement  \nOn-stack replacement (OSR) is one of the coolest features to hit the JIT in .NET 7. But to really \nunderstand OSR, we first need to underst', 'and tiered compilation, so a quick recap…  \nOne of the issues a managed environment with a JIT compiler has to deal with is tradeoffs between \nstartup and throughput. Historically, the j ob of an optimizing compiler is to, well, optimize, in order to \nenable the best possible throughput of the application or service once running. But such optimization \ntakes analysis, takes time, and performing all of that work then leads to increased startu p ti', 'me, as all \nof the code on the startup path (e.g.  all of the code that needs to be run before a web server can \nserve the first request) needs to be compiled. So a JIT compiler needs to make tradeoffs: better \nthroughput at the expense of longer startup t ime, or better startup time at the expense of decreased \nthroughput. For some kinds of apps and services, the tradeoff is an easy call, e.g.  if your service starts \nup once and then runs for d', 'ays, several extra seconds of startup time doesn’t matter, or if y ou’re a \nconsole application that’s going to do a quick computation and exit, startup time is all that matters. \nBut how can the JIT know which scenario it’s in, and do we really want every developer having to \nknow about these kinds of settings and tradeoffs  and configure every one of their applications \naccordingly? One answer to this has been ahead -of-time compilation, which ', 'has taken various forms \nin .NET. For example, all of the core libraries are “crossgen”’d, meaning they’ve been run through a \ntool that produces the previously mentioned R2R format, yielding binaries that contain assembly code \nthat needs only minor tweaks to actually execute; not every method can have code generated for it, \nbut enough that it significantly reduces startup time. Of course, such approaches have their own \ndownsides, e.g.  one of', ' the promises of a JIT compiler is it can take advantage of knowledge of the \ncurrent machine / process in order to best optimize, so for example the R2R images have to assume a  \n14 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n certain baseline instructi on set (e.g.  what vectorizing instructions are available) whereas the JIT can see \nwhat’s actually available and use the best. “Tiered compilation” provides another answer, one that’s \nusable with or without these other ', 'ahead -of-time (AOT) compilation soluti ons. \nTiered compilation enables the JIT to have its proverbial cake and eat it, too. The idea is simple: allow \nthe JIT to compile the same code multiple times. The first time, the JIT can use as a few optimizations \nas make sense (a handful of optimizations  can actually make the JIT’s own throughput faster, so those \nstill make sense to apply), producing fairly unoptimized assembly code but doing so real', 'ly quickly. \nAnd when it does so, it can add some instrumentation into the assembly to track how often the \nmethods are called. As it turns out, many functions used on a startup path are invoked once or maybe \nonly a handful of times, and it would take more time to optimize them than it does to just execute \nthem unoptimized. Then, when the method’s instrumentation  triggers some threshold, for example a \nmethod having been executed 30 times, a w', 'ork item gets queued to recompile that method, but this \ntime with all the optimizations the JIT can throw at it. This is lovingly referred to as “tiering up.” Once \nthat recomp ilation has completed, call sites to the method are patched with the address of the newly \nhighly optimized assembly code, and future invocations will then take the fast path. So, we get faster \nstartup and faster sustained throughput. At least, that’s the h ope. \nA probl', 'em, however, is methods that don’t fit this mold. While it’s certainly the case that many \nperformance -sensitive methods are relatively quick and executed many, many, many times, there’s \nalso a large number of performance -sensitive methods that are executed just a handful of times, or \nmaybe even only once, but that take a very long time to execute, maybe even the duration of the \nwhole process: methods with loops. As a result, by default tier', 'ed compilation hasn’t applied to loops, \nthough it can be  enabled by setting the DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops  environment variable to 1. We \ncan see the effect of this by trying this simple console app with .NET 6. With the default settings, run \nthis app:  \nclass Program \n{ \n    static void Main() \n    { \n        var sw = new System.Diagnostics .Stopwatch (); \n        while (true) \n        { \n            sw.Restart(); \n            for (int trial', " = 0; trial < 10_000; trial++)  \n            { \n                int count = 0; \n                for (int i = 0; i < char.MaxValue ; i++) \n                    if (IsAsciiDigit ((char)i)) \n                        count++;  \n            } \n            sw.Stop(); \n            Console. WriteLine (sw.Elapsed); \n        } \n \n        static bool IsAsciiDigit (char c) => (uint)(c - '0') <= 9; \n    } \n} \nI get numbe rs printed out like:   \n15 CHAPTER 2 | J", 'IT  \n 00:00:00.5734352  \n00:00:00.5526667  \n00:00:00.5675267  \n00:00:00.5588724  \n00:00:00.5616028  \nNow, try setting DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops  to 1. When I then run it again, I get numbers like this:  \n00:00:01.2841397  \n00:00:01.2693485  \n00:00:01.275564 6 \n00:00:01.2656678  \n00:00:01.2679925  \nIn other words, with DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops  enabled, it’s taking 2.5x as long as without (the \ndefault in .NET 6). That’s because this main funct', 'ion never gets optimizations applied to it. By setting \nDOTNET_TC_QuickJi tForLoops  to 1, we’re saying “JIT, please apply tiering to methods with loops as \nwell,” but this method with a loop is only ever invoked once, so for the duration of the process it ends \nup remaining at “tier -0,” aka unoptimized. Now, let’s try the same thing with .NET 7 . Regardless of \nwhether that environment variable is set, I again get numbers like this:  \n00:00:00.', '5528889  \n00:00:00.5562563  \n00:00:00.5622086  \n00:00:00.5668220  \n00:00:00.5589112  \nbut importantly, this method was still participating in tiering. In fact, we can g et confirmation of that \nby using the aforementioned DOTNET_JitDisasmSummary=1  environment variable. When I set that and \nrun again, I see these lines in the output:  \n   4: JIT compiled Program:Main() [Tier0, IL size=83, code size=319]  \n... \n   6: JIT compiled Program:Main() [T', 'ier1 -OSR @0x27, IL size=83, code size=380]  \nhighlighting that Main  was indeed compiled twice. How is that possible? On -stack replacement.  \nThe idea behind on -stack replacement is a method can be replaced not just between invocations but \neven  while it’s executing, while it’s “on the stack.” In addition to the tier -0 code being instrumented \nfor call counts, loops are also instrumented for iteration counts. When the iterations surpass a ce', 'rtain \nlimit, the JIT compiles a new highly optimized vers ion of that method, transfers all the local/register \nstate from the current invocation to the new invocation, and then jumps to the appropriate location in \nthe new method. We can see this in action by using the previously discussed DOTNET_JitDisasm  \nenviron ment variable. Set that to Program:*  in order to see the assembly code generated for all of the \nmethods in the Program  class, a', 'nd then run the app again. You should see output like the following:  \n; Assembly listing for method Program:Main()  \n; Emitting BLEN DED_CODE for X64 CPU with AVX - Windows \n; Tier-0 compilation  \n; MinOpts code  \n; rbp based frame  \n;

First, the comments at the top highlight how this code was \ncompiled:  \n; Tier-0 compilat ion \n; MinOpts code  \nSo, we know this is the initial version (“Tier -0”) of the method compiled with minimal optimization \n(“MinOpts”).', ' Second, note this line of the assembly:  \nFF152DD40B00         call     [Program:<Main>g__IsAsciiDigit|0_0(ushort):bool]  \nOur IsAsciiDigit  helper method is trivially inlineable, but it’s not getting inlined; instead, the \nassembly has a call to it, and indeed we can see below the generated code (also “MinOpts”) for \nIsAsciiDigit . Why? Because inlining is an optimization (a really important one) that’s  disabled as \npart of tier -0 (because th', 'e analysis for doing inlining well is also quite costly). Third, we can see the \ncode the JIT is outputting to instrument this method. This is a bit more involved, but I’ll point out the \nrelevant parts.

Total bytes of code 351  \nHere, again, we notice a few interesting things. First, in the header we see thi s: \n; Tier-1 compilation  \n; OSR variant for entry point 0x23  \n; optimized code  \nso we know this is both optimized “tier -1” code and is the “OSR variant” for this method. Second,', ' \nnotice there’s no longer a call to the IsAsciiDigit  helper. Instead, where that ca ll would have been, \nwe see this:  \nG_M000_IG06:                ;; offset=0090H  \n       0FB7CE               movzx    rcx, si  \n       83C1D0               add      ecx, -48 \n       83F909               cmp      ecx, 9  \n       7702                 ja       SHORT G _M000_IG08  \nThis is loading a value into rcx, subtracting 48 from it (48 is the decimal ASCII va', "lue of the '0' \ncharacter) and comparing the resulting value to 9. Sounds an awful lot like our IsAsciiDigit  \nimplementation ( (uint)(c - '0') <= 9 ), doesn’t it? Th at’s because it is. The helper was successfully \ninlined in this now -optimized code.  \nGreat, so now in .NET 7, we can largely avoid the tradeoffs between startup and throughput, as OSR \nenables tiered compilation to apply to all methods, even those that are l ong-running. A multit", 'ude of \nPRs went into enabling this, including many over the last few years, but all of the functionality was \ndisabled in the shipping bits. Thanks to improvements like dotnet/runtime#62831  which implemented \nsupport for OSR on Arm64 (previously only x64 support was implemented), and \ndotnet/runtime#63406  and dotnet/runtime#65609  which revised how OSR imports and epilogs are \nhandled, dotnet/runtime#65675  enables OSR (and as a result DOTNET_', 'TC_QuickJitForLoops ) by \ndefault.   \n21 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n But, tiered compilation and OSR aren’t just about startup (though they’re of course very valuable \nthere). They’re also about further improving throughput. Even though tiered compilation was \noriginally envisioned as a way  to optimize startup while not hurting throughput, it’s become much \nmore than that. There are various things the JIT can learn about a method during tier -0 that it c', 'an \nthen use for tier -1. For example, the very fact that the tier -0 code executed means that  any static s \naccessed by the method will have been initialized, and that means that any readonly static s will not \nonly have been initialized by the time the tier -1 code executes but their values won’t ever change. And \nthat in turn means that any readonly s tatics of primitive types (e.g. bool , int, etc.) can be treated like \nconst s instead of st', 'atic readonly  fields, and during tier -1 compilation the JIT can optimize them \njust as it would have optimized a const . For example, try running this simple program aft er setting \nDOTNET_JitDisasm  to Program:Test : \nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices ; \n \nclass Program \n{ \n    static readonly  bool Is64Bit = Environment. Is64BitProcess ; \n \n    static int Main() \n    { \n        int count = 0; \n        for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000_000; i+', '+) \n            if (Test()) \n                count++;  \n        return count; \n    } \n \n    [MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions.

First, we see the “Tier -0” code, which is accessing a \nstatic (note the call     CORINFO_HELP_GETSHARED_NONGCSTATIC_BASE  instruction). But then', ' we see \nthe “Tier -1” code, where all of that overhead has vanished and is instead replaced simply by  mov eax, \n1. Since the “Tier -0” code had to have executed in order for it to tier up, the “Tier -1” code was \ngenerated knowing that the value of the static readonly bool Is64Bit  field was true  (1), and so \nthe entirety of this method is storing the value 1 into the eax register used for the return value.  \nThis is so useful that components ', 'are now written with tiering in mind. Consider the new Regex  source \ngenerator, which is discussed later in this post (Roslyn source generators were introduced a couple of \nyears ago; just as how Roslyn analyzers are able to plug into the compiler and surface additional \ndiagnostics based on all of the data the compiler learns from the source code, Roslyn source \ngenerators are able to analyze that same data and then further augme nt the compila', 'tion unit with \nadditional source). The Regex  source generator applies a technique based on this in \ndotnet/runtime#67775 . Regex  supports setting a process -wide timeout that gets a pplied to Regex  \ninstances that don’t expl icitly set a timeout. That means, even though it’s super rare for such a \nprocess -wide timeout to be set, the Regex  source generator still needs to output timeout -related code \njust in case it’s needed. It does so by o', 'utputting some helpers like this:  \nstatic class Utilities  \n{ \n    internal  static readonly  TimeSpan s_defaultTimeout = \nAppContext. GetData("REGEX_DEFAULT_MATCH_TIMEOUT" ) is TimeSpan timeout ? timeout : \nTimeout. InfiniteTimeSpan ; \n    internal  static readonly  bool s_hasTimeout = s_defaultTimeout != \nTimeout.InfiniteTimeSpan ; \n} \nwhich it then uses at call sites like this:  \nif (Utilities. s_hasTimeout ) \n{ \n    base.CheckTimeout (); \n} ', '\nIn tier -0, these checks will still be emitted in the assembly code, but in tier -1 where throughput \nmatters, if the relevant AppContext  switch hasn’t been set, then s_defaultTimeout  will be  \n23 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan , at which point s_hasTimeout  will be false . And since s_hasTimeout  is a \nstatic readonly bool , the JIT will be able to treat that as a const , and all conditions like if \n(Utilities.s_hasTimeout)  will', ' be treated equal to if (false)  and be eliminated from the \nassembly code entirely as dead code.  \nBut, this is somewhat old news. The JIT has been able to do such an optimization since tiered \ncompilation was introduced in .NET Core 3 .0. Now in .NET 7, though, with OSR it’s also able to do so \nby default for methods with loops (and thus enable cases like the regex one). However, the real magic \nof OSR comes into play when combined with another', ' exciting feature: dynamic PGO.  \nPGO \nI wrote about profile -guided optimization (PGO) in my Performance Improvements in .NET 6  post, but \nI’ll cover it again here as it’s seen a multitude of improvements for .NET 7.  \nPGO has been around for a long time, in any number of languages and compilers. The basic idea is \nyou compile your app, asking the compiler to inject instrumentation into the application to track \nvarious pieces of interesting in', 'formation. You th en put your app through its paces, running through \nvarious common scenarios, causing that instrumentation to “profile” what happens when the app is \nexecuted, and the results of that are then saved out. The app is then recompiled, feeding those \ninstrumentat ion results back into the compiler, and allowing it to optimize the app for exactly how it’s \nexpected to be used. This approach to PGO is referred to as “static PGO,” as t', 'he information is all \ngleaned ahead of actual deployment, and it’s something .NET has  been doing in various forms for \nyears. From my perspective, though, the really interesting development in .NET is “dynamic PGO,” \nwhich was introduced in .NET 6, but off by default.  \nDynamic PGO takes advantage of tiered compilation. I noted that the JIT instruments the tier -0 code \nto track how many times the method is called, or in the case of loops, how ', 'many times the loop \nexecutes. It can instrument it for other things as well. For example, it can track exactly which concrete \ntypes are used as the targe t of an interface dispatch, and then in tier -1 specialize the code to expect \nthe most common types (this is referred to as “guarded devirtualization,” or GDV). You can see this in \nthis little example. Set the DOTNET_TieredPGO  environment variable to 1, and  then run this on .NET 7:  \nclass', ' Program \n{ \n    static void Main() \n    { \n        IPrinter printer = new Printer(); \n        for (int i = 0; ; i++)  \n        { \n            DoWork(printer, i);  \n        } \n    } \n \n    static void DoWork(IPrinter printer, int i) \n    { \n        printer. PrintIfTrue (i == int.MaxValue ); \n    } \n \n    interface  IPrinter  \n    { \n        void PrintIfTrue (bool condition);   \n24 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n     } \n \n    class Printer : IPrinter  \n    { \n', '        public void PrintIfTrue (bool condition)  \n        { \n            if (condition) Console. WriteLine ("Print!" ); \n        } \n    } \n} \nThe tier -0 code for DoWork  ends up looking like this:  \nG_M000_IG01:                ;; offset=0000H  \n       55                   push     rbp  \n       4883EC30             sub      rsp, 48  \n       488D6C2430           lea      rbp, [rsp+30H]  \n       33C0                 xor      eax, eax  \n       4889', '45F8             mov      qword ptr [rbp -08H], rax  \n       488945F0             mov      qword ptr [rbp -10H], rax  \n       48894D10             mov      gword ptr  [rbp+10H], rcx  \n       895518               mov      dword ptr [rbp+18H], edx  \n \nG_M000_IG02:                ;; offset=001BH  \n       FF059F220F00         inc      dword ptr [(reloc 0x7ffc3f1b2ea0)]  \n       488B4D10             mov      rcx, gword ptr [rbp+10H]  \n       48894DF8 ', '            mov      gword ptr [rbp -08H], rcx  \n       488B4DF8             mov      rcx, gword ptr [rbp -08H] \n       48BAA82E1B3FFC7F0000 mov      rdx, 0x7FFC3F1B2EA8  \n       E8B47EC55F           call     CORINFO_HELP_CLASSPROFILE32  \n       488B4DF8             mov      rcx, gword ptr [rbp -08H] \n       48894DF0             mov      gword ptr [rbp -10H], rcx  \n       488B4DF0             mov      rcx, gword ptr [rbp -10H] \n       33D2       ', '          xor      edx, edx  \n       817D18FFFFFF7F       cmp      dword ptr [rbp+18H], 0x7FFFFFFF  \n       0F94C2               sete     dl  \n       49BB0800F13EFC7F0000 mov      r11, 0x7FFC3EF10008  \n       41FF13               call     [r11]IPrinter:PrintIfTrue(bool):this  \n       90                   nop  \n \nG_M000_IG03:                ;; offset=0062H  \n       4883C430             add      rsp, 48  \n       5D                   pop      rbp  \n', '       C3                   ret  \nand most notably, you can see the call [r11]IPrinter:PrintIfTrue(bool):this  doing the \ninterface dispatch.

If the y’re different, it just jumps to the same interface \ndispatch it was doing in the unoptimized version. But if they’', 're the same, it then jumps directly to an \ninlined version of Printer.PrintIfTrue  (you can see the call to Console:WriteLine  right there in \nthis method). Thus, the common case (the only case in this example) is super efficient at the expense \nof a single comparison and branch.  \nThat all existed in .NET 6, so why are we talking about it now? Several things have improved. First, \nPGO now works with OS R, thanks to improvements like dotnet/runti', 'me#61453 . That’s a big deal, as it \nmeans hot long -running methods that do this kind of interface dispatch (which are fairly common) \ncan get these kinds of devirtualization/inlining optimizations. Second, while PGO isn’t currently \nenabled by default, we’ve made it much easier to turn on. Between dotnet/runtime#71438  and \ndotnet/sdk#26350 , it’s now possible to simply put <TieredPGO>true</TieredPGO>  into your .csproj, \nand it’ll have the sa ', 'me effect as if you set DOTNET_TieredPGO=1  prior to every invocation of the app, \nenabling dynamic PGO (note that it doesn’t  disable use of R2R images, so if you want the entirety of \nthe core libraries also employing dynamic PGO, you’ll also need to set DOTNET_ReadyToRun=0 ). Third, \nhowever, is dynamic PGO has been taught how to instrument and optimize additional things.  \nPGO already knew how to instrument virtual dispatch. Now in .NET 7, th', 'anks in large part to \ndotnet/runtime#68703 , it can do so for delegates as well (at least for delegates to instance methods). \nConsider this simple console app:  \nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices ; \n \nclass Program \n{ \n    static int[] s_values = Enumerable.

To understand this better, a brief digression into \nwhat those are. Loop cloning is a mechanism the JIT employs to avoid various overheads in the fast \npath of a loop. Consider the Test  method in this example:  \nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices ; \n \nclass Program \n{ \n    static void Main() \n    { \n        int[] array = new int[10_000_000]; \n        for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) \n        { \n            Test(a', 'rray);  \n        } \n    } \n  \n29 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n     [MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions.

Instead, the JIT employs “loop cloning.” It \nessenti ally rewrites this Test  method t', 'o be more like this:  \nif (array is not null && array.

Remember that with the interface/virtual dispatch \navoidance PGO is able to do, it does so by doi', 'ng a type check to see whether the type in use is the \nmost common type; if it is, it uses a fast path that calls directly to that type’s method (and in doing so \nthat call is then potentially inlined), and if it isn’t, it falls back to normal interface/virtual dispatch.

The runtime guards access to arrays, strings, \nand sp ans such that you can’t accidentally corrupt memory by walking off either end; if you do, rather \nthan reading/writing arbitrary memory, you’ll get exceptions. Of course, that’s not magic; it’s done by \nthe JIT inserting bounds checks every time one of these  data structures is inde', 'xed. For example, this:  \n[MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions. NoInlining )] \nstatic int Read0thElement (int[] array) => array[ 0]; \nresults in:  \nG_M000_IG01:                ;; offset=0000H  \n       4883EC28             sub      rsp, 40  \n \nG_M000_IG02:                ;; offset=0004H  \n       83790800             cmp      dword ptr [rcx+08H], 0  \n       7608                 jbe      SHORT G_M000_IG04  \n       8B4110               mov      eax, dword ', 'ptr [rcx+10H]  \n \nG_M000_IG03:                ;; off set=000DH  \n       4883C428             add      rsp, 40  \n       C3                   ret  \n \nG_M000_IG04:                ;; offset=0012H  \n       E8E9A0C25F           call     CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL  \n       CC                   int3  \nThe array is passed into this method in the rcx register, pointing to the method table pointer in the \nobject, and the length of an array is stored in the obj', 'ect just after that method table pointer (which is \n8 bytes in a 64 -bit process). Thus the cmp dword ptr [rcx+08H], 0  instruction is reading the length  \n36 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n of the array and comparing the length to 0; that makes sense, since the length can’t be negative, and \nwe’re trying to access the 0th element, so as long as the length isn’t 0, the array has enough elements \nfor us to access its 0th ele ment. In the event that the length ', 'was 0, the code jumps to the end of the \nfunction, which contains call CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL ; that’s a JIT helper function that throws an \nIndexOutOfRangeException . If the length was sufficient, however, it then reads the  int stored at the \nbeginning of the array’s data, which on 64 -bit is 16 bytes (0x10) past the pointer ( mov eax, dword \nptr [rcx+10H] ). \nWhile these bounds checks in and of themselves aren’t super expensive, do a lot of t', 'hem and their \ncosts add up. So while t he JIT needs to ensure that “safe” accesses don’t go out of bounds, it also tries \nto prove that certain accesses won’t, in which case it needn’t emit the bounds check that it knows will \nbe superfluous. In every release of .NET, more and more cases have bee n added to find places these \nbounds checks can be eliminated, and .NET 7 is no exception.  \nFor example, dotnet/runtime#61662  from [@anthonycanino](h', 'ttps://github.com/anthonycanino) \nenabled the JIT to understand various forms of binary operations as part of range checks. Consider \nthis method:  \n[MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions. NoInlining )] \nprivate static ushort[]? Convert(ReadOnlySpan< byte> bytes)  \n{ \n    if (bytes.Length != 16) \n    { \n        return null; \n    } \n \n    var result = new ushort[8]; \n    for (int i = 0; i < result. Length; i++) \n    { \n        result[i] = ( ushort)(bytes[', 'i * 2] * 256 + bytes[i * 2 + 1]); \n    } \n \n    return result; \n} \nIt’s validating that the input span is 16 bytes long and then creating a new ushort[8]  where each \nushort  in the array combines two of the input bytes. To do that, it’s looping over the output array, \nand indexing into the bytes array using i * 2  and i * 2 + 1  as the indices. On  .NET 6, each of those \nindexing operations would result in a bounds check, with assembly like:  \nc', 'mp       r8d,10     \njae       short G_M000_IG04  \nmovsxd    r8,r8d  \nwhere that G_M000_IG04 is the call CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL  we’re now familiar with.

With this PR, the JIT is able to understand the \nimpact of certain multiplication and shift operations and their relationships to the bounds of the data \nstructure. Since it can see that the result array’s length is 8 and the loop is iterating from  0 to that \nexclusive upper bound, it knows that i will always be in the range [0, 7] , which means that i * 2  ', 'will \nalways be in the range [0, 14]  and i * 2 + 1  will always be in the range [0, 15] . As such, it’s able \nto prove that the bounds checks aren’t ne eded.  \ndotnet/runtime#61569  and dotnet/runtime#62864  also help to eliminate bounds checks when dealing \nwith constant strings and spans initialized from RVA statics (“Relative Virtual Address” static fields, \nbasically a static field that lives in a module’s data section).

Immediately after that jump we see a movsxd rax, edx  instruction, \nwhich is  taking the 32 -bit value of i from edx and moving it into the 64 -bit register rax. And as part \nof moving it, it’s sign -extending it; that’s the “sxd” part of the instruction name (sign -extending means \nthe upper 32 bits of the new 64 -bit value will be set t o the value o', 'f the upper bit of the 32 -bit value, \nso that the number retains its signed value). The interesting thing is, though, we know that the Length  \nof an array and of a span is non -negative, and since we just bounds checked i against the Length , we \nalso know that i is non -negative. That makes such sign -extension useless, since the upper bit is \nguaranteed to be 0. Since the mov instruction that zero -extends is a tad cheaper than movsxd , we ca', 'n \nsimply use that instead. And that’s exactly what dotnet/runtime#57970  from \n[@pentp](https://github.com/pentp) does for both arrays and spans ( dotnet/runtime#70884  also \nsimilarly avoids so me signed casts in other situations).

And \ndotnet/runtime#70232  increases the JIT’s willingness to clone loops with bodies that do a broader set \nof operations.  \nFolding, propagation, and substitu tio', 'n \nConstant folding is an optimization where a compiler computes the value of an expression involving \nonly constants at compile -time rather than generating the code to compute the value at run -time. \nThere are multiple levels of constant folding in .NET, with some constant folding performed by the C# \ncompiler and some constant folding performed by the JIT compiler. For example, given the C# code:  \n[Benchmark]  \npublic int A() => 3 + (4 * 5);', ' \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic int B() => A() * 2; \nthe C# compiler will generate IL for these methods like the following:  \n.method public hidebysig instance int32 A () cil managed  \n{ \n    .maxstack 8  \n    IL_0000: ldc.i4.s 23  \n    IL_0002: ret  \n} \n \n.method public hidebysig instance int32 B () cil managed  \n{ \n    .maxstack 8  \n    IL_0000: ldarg.0  \n    IL_0001: call instance int32 Program::A()  \n    IL_0006: ldc.i4.2  \n    IL_0007: mul  \n    IL', '_0008: ret  \n} \nYou can see that the C# compiler has computed the value of 3 + (4*5) , as the IL for method A simply \ncontains the equivalent of return 23; . However, method B contains the equivalent of return A() * \n2;, highlighting that the constant folding performed by the C# compiler was intramethod only. Now \nhere’s what the JIT generates:  \n; Program.A()  \n       mov       eax,17  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code  6 \n \n; Program.B()  \n   ', '    mov       eax,2E  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code 6   \n51 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n The assembly for method A isn’t particularly interesting; it’s just returning that same value 23 (hex \n0x17). But method B is more interesting. The JIT has inlined the call from B to A, exposing the contents \nof A to B, such that the JIT effectively sees the body of B as the equivalent of return 23 * 2; . At that \npoint, the JIT can do its own constant folding, an', 'd it transforms the body of B to simply return 46 (hex \n0x2e). Constant pr opagation is intricately linked to constant folding and is essentially just the idea that \nyou can substitute a constant value (typically one computed via constant folding) into further \nexpressions, at which point they may also be able to be folded.  \nThe JIT  has long performed constant folding, but it improves further in .NET 7. One of the ways \nconstant folding can imp', 'rove is by exposing more values to be folded, which often means more \ninlining. dotnet/runtime#55745  helped the inliner to understand that a method call like M(constant + \nconstant)  (noting that those constants might be the result of some other method call) is itself \npassing a constant to M, and a constant being passed to a method call  is a hint to the inliner that it \nshould consider being more aggressive about inlining, since exposing that ', 'constant to the body of the \ncallee can potentially significantly reduce the amount of code required to implement the callee. The \nJIT might have prev iously inlined such a method anyway, but when it comes to inlining, the JIT is all \nabout heuristics and generating enough evidence that it’s worthwhile to inline something; this \ncontributes to that evidence. This pattern shows up, for example, in the vario us FromXx  methods on \nTimeSpan . For ex', 'ample, TimeSpan.FromSeconds  is implemented as:  \npublic static TimeSpan FromSeconds (double value) => Interval (value, TicksPerSecond); // \nTicksPerSecond is a constant  \nand, eschewing argument validation for the purposes of this example, Interval  is: \nprivate static TimeSpan Interval (double value, double scale) => \nIntervalFromDoubleTicks (value * scale);  \nprivate static TimeSpan IntervalFromDoubleTicks (double ticks) => ticks  == long.MaxV', 'alue  ? \nTimeSpan. MaxValue  : new TimeSpan ((long)ticks);  \nwhich if everything gets inlined means FromSeconds  is essentially:  \npublic static TimeSpan FromSeconds (double value) \n{ \n    double ticks = value * 10_000_000; \n    return ticks == long.MaxValue  ? TimeSpan. MaxValue  : new TimeSpan ((long)ticks);  \n} \nand if value  is a constant, let’s say 5, that whole thing can be constant folded (with dead code \nelimination on the ticks == long.M', 'axValue  branch) to simply:  \nreturn new TimeSpan (50_000_000); \nI’ll spare you the .NET 6 assembly for this, but on .NET 7 with a benchmark like:  \n[Benchmark]  \npublic TimeSpan FromSeconds () => TimeSpan. FromSeconds (5); \nwe now get the simple and clean:  \n; Program.FromSeconds()  \n       mov       eax,2FAF080   \n52 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n        ret \n; Total bytes of code 6  \nAnother change improving constant folding included dotnet/runtime#57726 ', ' from \n[@SingleAccretion](https://github.com/SingleAccretion), which unblocked constant folding in a \nparticular scenario that sometimes manifests when doing field -by-field assignment of structs being \nreturned from method calls. As a small example, consider this trivial property, which access the \nColor.DarkOrange  property, which in turn does new Color(KnownCol or.DarkOrange) : \n[Benchmark]  \npublic Color DarkOrange () => Color. DarkOrange ; \n', 'In .NET 6, the JIT generated this:  \n; Program.DarkOrange()  \n       mov       eax,1  \n       mov       ecx,39  \n       xor       r8d,r8d  \n       mov       [rdx],r8  \n       mov       [rdx+8], r8 \n       mov       [rdx+10],cx  \n       mov       [rdx+12],ax  \n       mov       rax,rdx  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code 32  \nThe interesting thing here is that some constants (39, which is the value of KnownColor.DarkOrange , \nand 1, which is a priv', 'ate StateKno wnColorValid  constant) are being loaded into registers ( mov eax, \n1, mov ecx, 39 ) and then later being stored into the relevant location for the Color  struct being \nreturned ( mov [rdx+12],ax  and mov [rdx+10],cx ). In .NET 7, it now generates:  \n; Program.DarkOr ange() \n       xor       eax,eax  \n       mov       [rdx],rax  \n       mov       [rdx+8],rax  \n       mov       word ptr [rdx+10],39  \n       mov       word ptr [rdx+12]', ',1  \n       mov       rax,rdx  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code 25  \nwith direct assignment of these constant values into their destination locations ( mov word ptr \n[rdx+12],1  and mov word ptr [rdx+10],39 ).

Consider this silly benchmark:  \n[Benchmark]  \npublic int Compute1 () => Value + Value + Value + Value + Value;  \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic int Compute2 () => SomethingElse () + Value + Value + Value + Value + Value;  \n \nprivate static int Value => 16;  \n53 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n  \n[MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions.

The structure of the code is such that the additional call to \nSomethingElse  ends up slightly perturbing something about the JIT’s analysis, and .NET 6 ends up \nwith this assembly code:  \n; Program.Compute2()  \n       sub       rsp,28  \n       call      Program.SomethingElse()  \n       add       eax,10  \n       add       eax,10  \n       add       eax,10 \n       add       eax,10  \n       add', '       eax,10  \n       add       rsp,28  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code 29  \nRather than a single mov eax, 50  to put the value 0x50 into the return register, we have 5 separate \nadd eax, 10  to build up that same 0x5 0 (80) value. That’s… not ideal.  \nIt turns out that many of the JIT’s optimizations operate on the tree data structures created as part of \nparsing the IL. In some cases, optimizations can do better when they’re exposed to more', ' of the \nprogram, in other words  when the tree they’re operating on is larger and contains more to be \nanalyzed. However, various operations can break up these trees into smaller, individual ones, such as \nwith temporary variables created as part of inlining, and in doing so can inhibit th ese operations. \nSomething is needed in order to effectively stitch these trees back together, and that’s forward \nsubstitution. You can think of forward subs', 'titution almost like an inverse of CSE; rather than trying to \nfind duplicate expressions and elimina te them by computing the value once and storing it into a \ntemporary, forward substitution eliminates that temporary and effectively moves the expression tree \ninto its use site. Obviously you don’t want to do this if it would then negate CSE and result in \nduplicate work, but for expressions that are defined once and used once, this kind of forw', 'ard \npropagation is valuable. dotnet/runtime#61023  added an initial limited version of forward \nsubstitut ion, and then dotnet/runtime#63720  added a more robust generalized implementation. \nSubsequently, dotnet/runtime#70587  expanded i t to also cover some SIMD vectors, and then \ndotnet/runtime#71161  improved it further to enable substitutions into more places (in this case into \ncall arguments). And with those, our silly benc hmark now produ', 'ces the following on .NET 7:  \n; Program.Compute2()  \n       sub       rsp,28  \n       call      qword ptr [7FFCB8DAF9A8]   \n54 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n        add       eax,50  \n       add       rsp,28  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code 18  \nVectorization  \nSIMD, or Single Instruction  Multiple Data, is a kind of processing in which one instruction applies to \nmultiple pieces of data at the same time. You’ve got a list of numbers and you want to find', ' the index \nof a particular value? You could walk the list comparing one element at a time , and that would be fine \nfunctionally. But what if in the same amount of time it takes you to read and compare one element, \nyou could instead read and compare two elements, or four elements, or 32 elements? That’s SIMD, \nand the art of utilizing SIMD instru ctions is lovingly referred to as “vectorization,” where operations \nare applied to all of the elem', 'ents in a “vector” at the same time.  \n.NET has long had support for vectorization in the form of Vector<T> , which is an easy -to-use type \nwith first -class JIT s upport to enable a developer to write vectorized implementations. One of \nVector<T> ’s greatest strengths is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The type is designed to adapt to \nwhatever width vector instructions are available in your hardware. If the machi ne supports 256 -bit \nwid', 'th vectors, great, that’s what Vector<T>  will target. If not, if the machine supports 128 -bit width \nvectors, great, that’s what Vector<T>  targets. But that flexibility comes with various downsides, at least \ntoday; for example, the op erations you can perform on a Vector<T>  end up needing to be agnostic to \nthe width of the vectors used, since the width is variable based on the hardware on which the code \nactually runs. And that means the op', 'erations that can be exposed on Vector<T>  are li mited, which in \nturn limits the kinds of operations that can be vectorized with it. Also, because it’s only ever a single \nsize in a given process, some data set sizes that fall in between 128 bits and 256 bits might not be \nprocessed as well as you’d hope. You write your Vector<byte> -based algorithm, and you run it on a \nmachine with support for 256 -bit vectors, which means it can process 32 b', 'ytes at a time, but then you \nfeed it an input with 31 bytes. Had Vector<T>  mapped to 128 -bit vectors, it could have be en used to \nimprove the processing of that input, but as its vector size is larger than the input data size, the \nimplementation ends up falling back to one that’s not accelerated. There are also issues related to \nR2R and Native AOT, since ahead -of-time comp ilation needs to know in advance what instructions \nshould be used ', 'for Vector<T>  operations. You already saw this earlier when discussing the output of \nDOTNET_JitDisasmSummary ; we saw that the NarrowUtf16ToAscii  method was one of only a few \nmethods that was  JIT compiled in a “hello, world” console app, and that this was because it lacked R2R \ncode due to its use of Vector<T> . \nStarting in .NET Core 3.0, .NET gained literally thousands of new “hardware intrinsics” methods, most \nof which are .NET APIs that', ' map d own to one of these SIMD instructions. These intrinsics enable an \nexpert to write an implementation tuned to a specific instruction set, and if done well, get the best \npossible performance, but it also requires the developer to understand each instruction set and to \nimplement their algorithm for each instruction set that might be relevant, e.g.  an AVX2 \nimplementation if it’s supported, or an SSE2 implementation if it’s supported, or a', 'n ArmBase \nimplementation if it’s supported, and so on.  \n.NET 7 ha s introduced a middle ground. Previous releases saw the introduction of the Vector128<T>  \nand Vector256<T>  types, but purely as the vehicle by which data moved in and out of the hardware \nintrinsics, since they’re all tied to specific width vectors. Now in . NET 7, exposed via  \n55 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n dotnet/runtime#53450 , dotnet/runtime#63414 , dotnet/runtime#60094 , and dotne', 't/runtime#68559 , a \nvery large set of cross -platform operations is defined over these types as well, e.g. \nVector128<T>.ExtractMostSignificantBits , Vector256.ConditionalSelect , and so on. A \ndeveloper who wants or needs to go beyond what the high -level Vector<T>  offers can choose to \ntarget one or more of these two types. Typically this would amount to a developer writing one code \npath based on Vector12 8<T> , as that has the broadest reac', 'h and achieves a significant amount of the \ngains from vectorization, and then if is motivated to do so can add a second path for Vector256<T>  in \norder to potentially double throughput further on platforms that have 256 -bit width vectors. Think of \nthese types and methods as a platform -abstraction layer: you code to these methods, and then the JIT \ntranslates them into the most appropriate instructions for the underlying platform. Consider th', 'is \nsimple code as an example:  \nusin g System.Runtime.CompilerServices ; \nusing System.Runtime.Intrinsics ; \nusing System.Runtime.Intrinsics .X86; \n \ninternal  class Program \n{ \n    private static void Main() \n    { \n        Vector128< byte> v = Vector128.

First things first, we need to check whether it’s even \nsupported, and fall back to our existing implementation if it’s not ( Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated ). \nWe also need to fall back if the length of the input is l ess than the size of a vector \n(Vector<byte>.Count ). \nstatic bool Contains (ReadOnlySpan< byte> haystack, byte needle) \n{ \n    if (Vector.

In this loop, we’ll \nbe searching', ' for the needle , which means we need a vector that contains that value for every element; \nthe Vector<T> ’s constructor provides that ( new Vector<byte>(needle) ). And w e need to be able to \nslice off a vector’s width of data at a time; for a bit more efficiency, I’ll use pointers. We need a current \niteration pointer, and we need to iterate until the point where we couldn’t form another vector \nbecause we’re too close to th e end, and a straig', 'htforward way to do that is to get a pointer that’s \nexactly one vector’s width from the end; that way, we can just iterate until our current pointer is equal \nto or greater than that threshold. And finally, in our loop body, we need to co mpare our current \nvector with the target vector to see if any elements are the same ( Vector.EqualsAny ), if any is \nreturning true, and if not bumping our current pointer to the next location. At this point w', 'e have:  \nstatic unsafe bool Contains (ReadOnlySpan< byte> haystack, byte needle) \n{ \n    if (Vector. IsHardwareAccelerated  && haystack.

The last issue to handle is we may still have a few elements at the end we \nhaven’t searched. There are a couple of ways we could handle that. One would be to just continue \nwith our fall back implementation and process each of the remaining elements one at a time. Another \nwould be to employ a trick tha', 't’s co mmon when vectorizing idempotent operations. Our operation \nisn’t mutating anything, which means it doesn’t matter if we compare the same element multiple \ntimes, which means we can just do one final vector compare for the last vector in the search space;  \n58 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n that might or might not overlap with elements we’ve already looked at, but it won’t hurt anything if it \ndoes.

But the capabilities are all there, and \nwhether you choose to use Vector<T> , Vector128<T>  and/or Vector256<T> , or the hardware \nintrinsics directly, there are some ', 'amazing performance opportunities ready for the taking.   \n62 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n I already mentioned several PRs that exposed the new cross -platform vector support, but that only \nscratches the surface of the work done to actually enable these operations and to enable them to \nproduce high -quality code. As just one example of a category of such work, a set of changes went in \nto help ensure that zero vector constants are handled well, such as d', 'otnet/runtime#63821  that \n“morphed” (changed) Vector128/256<T>.Create(default)  into Vector128/256<T>.Zero , which then \nenables subsequent optimizations to focus only on Zero ; dotnet/runtime#65028  that enabled \nconstant propagation of Vector128/256<T>.Zero ; dotnet/runtime#68874  and dotnet/ru ntime#70171  \nthat add first -class knowledge of vector constants to the JIT’s intermediate representation; and \ndotnet/runtime#62933 , dotnet/runtime#', '65632 , dotnet/runtime#55875 , dotnet/runtime#67502 , and \ndotnet/runtime#64783  that all improve the code quality of instructions generated for zero vector \ncomparisons.  \nInlining  \nInlining is one of the most important optimizations the JIT can do. The con cept is simple: instead of \nmaking a call to some method, take the code from that method and bake it into the call site. This has \nthe obvious advantage of avoiding the overhead of a method ', 'call, but except for really small methods \non really hot paths, that’ s often on the smaller side of the wins inlining brings. The bigger wins are \ndue to the callee’s code being exposed to the caller’s code, and vice versa. So, for example, if the \ncaller is passing a constant as an argument to the callee, if the method isn’t  inlined, the compilation of \nthe callee has no knowledge of that constant, but if the callee is inlined, all of the code', ' in the callee is \nthen aware of its argument being a constant value, and can do all of the optimizations possible with \nsuch a constant, like dead code elimination, branch elimination, constant folding and propagation, \nand so on. Of course, if it were all rainbows and unicorns, everything possible to be inlined would be \ninlined, and that’s obviously not happening. Inlining brings with it th e cost of potentially increased \nbinary size. If the ', 'code being inlined would result in the same amount or less assembly code in the \ncaller than it takes to call the callee (and if the JIT can quickly determine that), then inlining is a no -\nbrainer. But if t he code being inlined would increase the size of the callee non -trivially, now the JIT \nneeds to weigh that increase in code size against the throughput benefits that could come from it. \nThat code size increase can itself result in throughp', 'ut regressions, d ue to increasing the number of \ndistinct instructions to be executed and thereby putting more pressure on the instruction cache. As \nwith any cache, the more times you need to read from memory to populate it, the less effective the \ncache will be. If you have  a function that gets inlined into 100 different call sites, every one of those \ncall sites’ copies of the callee’s instructions are unique, and calling each of those 100 f', 'unctions could \nend up thrashing the instruction cache; in contrast, if all of those 1 00 functions “shared” the same \ninstructions by simply calling the single instance of the callee, it’s likely the instruction cache would be \nmuch more effective and lead to fewer trips to memory.  \nAll that is to say, inlining is really  important, it’s import ant that the “right” things be inlined and that it \nnot overinline, and as such every release of .NET', ' in recent memory has seen nice improvements \naround inlining. .NET 7 is no exception.  \nOne really interesting improvement around inlining is dotnet/runtime#64521 , and it might be \nsurprising. Consider the Boolean.ToString  method; here’s its full implementation:  \npublic override  string ToString () \n{  \n63 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n     if (!m_value) return "False"; \n    return "True"; \n} \nPretty simple, right? You’d expect something this trivial to ', 'be inlined. Alas, on .NET 6, this benchmark:  \nprivate bool _value = true; \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic int BoolStringLength () => _value. ToString ().Length; \nproduces this assembly code:  \n; Program.BoolStringLength()  \n       sub       rsp,28  \n       cmp       [rcx],ecx  \n       add       rcx,8  \n       call      System.Boolean.ToString()  \n       mov       eax,[rax+8]  \n       add       rsp,28  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code 23  \nNote the cal', 'l System.Bo olean.ToString() . The reason for this is, historically, the JIT has been \nunable to inline methods across assembly boundaries if those methods contain string literals (like the \n"False"  and "True"  in that Boolean.ToString  implementation). This restriction ha d to do with string \ninterning and the possibility that such inlining could lead to visible behavioral differences. Those \nconcerns are no longer valid, and so this PR removes', ' the restriction. As a result, that same benchmark \non .NET 7 now produces this:  \n; Program.BoolStringLength()  \n       cmp       byte ptr [rcx+8],0  \n       je        short M00_L01  \n       mov       rax,1DB54800D20  \n       mov       rax,[rax]  \nM00_L00:  \n       mov       eax,[rax+8]  \n       ret \nM00_L01:  \n       mov       rax,1DB54800D18  \n       mov       rax,[rax]  \n       jmp       short M00_L00  \n; Total bytes of code 38  \nNo more call', ' System.Boolean.ToString() . \ndotnet/runtime#61408  made two changes related to inlining. First, it taught the i nliner how to better \nsee the what methods were being called in an inlining candidate, and in particular when tiered \ncompilation is disabled or when a method would bypass tier -0 (such as a method with loops before \nOSR existed or with OSR disabled); by under standing what methods are being called, it can better \nunderstand the cost o', 'f the method, e.g.  if those method calls are actually hardware intrinsics with a \nvery low cost. Second, it enabled CSE in more cases with SIMD vectors.  \ndotnet/runtime#71778  also impacted inlining, and in particular in situations where a typeof()  could \nbe propagated to the callee (e.g.  via a method argument). In previous releases of .NET, various  \n64 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n members on Type  like IsValueType  were turned into JIT intrinsics, su', 'ch that the JIT could substitute a \nconstant value for calls where it could compute the answer at compile time. For example, this:  \n[Benchmark]  \npublic bool IsValueType () => IsValueType< int>(); \n \nprivate static bool IsValueType<T>() => typeof(T).IsValueType ; \nresults in this assembly code on .NET 6:  \n; Program.IsValueType()  \n       mov       eax,1  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code 6  \nHowever, change the benchmark slightly:  \n[Benchmark', ']  \npublic bool IsValueType () => IsValueTyp e(typeof(int)); \n \nprivate static bool IsValueType (Type t) => t.

This PR fixes that, such that on .NET 7, we now get what we expect:  \n; Program.IsValueType()  \n       mov       eax,1  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code 6  \nArm64  \nA huge amount of effort i n .NET 7 went into making code gen for Arm64 as good or better than its \nx64 counterpart. I’ve already d', 'iscussed a bunch of PRs that are relevant regardless of architecture, and \nothers that are specific to Arm, but there are plenty more. To rattle off some of them:  \n• Addressing modes . “Addressing mode” is the term used to refer to how the operand of \ninstructions are specified. It could be the actual value, it could be the address from where a value \nshould be loaded, it could be the register containing the valu e, and so on. Arm supports a \n“s', 'caled” addressing mode, typically used for indexing into an array, where the size of each \nelement is supplied and the instruction “scales” the provided offset by the specified scale. \ndotnet/runtime#60808  enables the JIT to utilize this addressing mode. More generally, \ndotnet/runtime#70749  enables the JIT to use addressing modes when accessing elements  of  \n65 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n managed arrays. dotnet/runtime#66902  improves the use of addre', 'ssing modes when the \nelement type is byte . dotnet/runtime#6546 8 improves addressing modes used for floating point. \nAnd dotnet/runtime#67490  implements addressing modes for SIMD vectors, specifically for \nloads with unscaled indices.  \n• Better instruction selection . Various techniques go into ensuring that the best instructions are \nselected to represent input code. dotnet/runtime#61037  teaches the JIT how to recognize the \npattern (a * b)', ' + c  with integers and fold that into a single madd  or msub  instruction, while \ndotnet/runtime#66621  does the same for a - (b * c)  and msub . dotnet/runtime#61045  \nenables the JIT to recognize certain constant bit shift operations (either explicit in the code or \nimplicit to various forms of managed array access) and emit sbfiz /ubfiz  instructions. \ndotnet/runtime#70599 , dotnet/runtime#66407 , and dotnet/runtime#655 35 all handle various ', '\nforms of optimizing a % b . dotnet/runtime#61847  from \n[@SeanWoo](https://github.com/SeanWoo) removes an unnecessary movi  emitted as part of \nsetting a dereferenced pointer to a constant value. dotnet/runtime#57926  from \n[@SingleAccretion](https://github.com/SingleAccretion) enables computing a 64 -bit result as the \nmultiplication of two 32 -bit integers to be done with smull /umull . And dotnet/runtime#61549  \nfolds adds with sign extension', ' or zero extension into a single add instruction with \nuxtw /sxtw /lsl, while dotnet/runtime#62630  drops redundant zero extensions after a ldr \ninstruction.  \n• Vectorization . dotnet/runtime#64864  adds new \nAdvSimd.LoadPairVector64 /AdvSimd.LoadPairVector12 8 hardware intrinsics.  \n• Zeroing . Lots of operations require state to be set to zero, such as initializing all reference locals \nin a method to zero as part of the method’s prologue (so ', 'that the GC doesn’t see and try to \nfollow garbage references). While such  functionality was previously vectorized, \ndotnet/runtime#63422  enables this to be implemented using 128 -bit width vector instructions \non Arm. And dotnet/runtime#64481  changes the instruction sequences used for zeroing in order \nto avoid unnecessary zeroing, free up additional registers, and enable the CPU to recognize \nvarious instruction sequences and better optimize', '.  \n• Memory Model . dotnet/runtime#62895  enables store barriers to be used wherever possible \ninstead of full barriers, and uses one -way barriers for volatile  variables. dotnet/runtime#67384  \nenables volatile reads/writes to be implemented with the ldapr  instruction, while \ndotnet/runtime#64354  uses a  cheaper instruction sequence to handle volatile indirections. \nThere’s dotnet/runtime#70600 , which enables LSE Atomics to be used for Inte', 'rlocked  \noperations; dotnet/runtime#71512 , which enables using the atomics  instruction on Unix \nmachines; and dotnet/runtime#70921 , which enables the same but on Windows.  \nJIT helpers  \nWhile logically part of the runtime, the JIT is actually isolated from the rest of the runtime, only \ninteracting with it through an interface that enables communication between the JIT and the rest of \nthe VM (Virtual Machine). There’s a large amount of VM f', ' unctionality then that the JIT relies on for \ngood performance.  \ndotnet/runtime#65738  rewrote various “stubs” to be more efficient. Stubs are tiny bits of code that \nserve to perform some check a nd then redirect execution somewhere else. For example, when an \ninterface dispatch call site is expected to only ever be used with a single implementation of that \ninterface, the JIT might employ a “dispatch stub” that compares the type of the object', ' agains t the  \n66 CHAPTER 2 | JIT  \n single one it’s cached, and if they’re equal simply jumps to the right target. You know you’re in the \ncorest of the core areas of the runtime when a PR contains lots of assembly code for every \narchitecture the runtime targets. And it paid off; there’ s a virtual group of folks from around .NET that \nreview performance improvements and regressions in our automated performance test suites, and \nattribute thes', 'e back to the PRs likely to be the cause (this is mostly automated but requires some \nhuman oversigh t). It’s always nice then when a few days after a PR is merged and performance \ninformation has stabilized that you see a rash of comments like there were on this PR:  \n \nFor anyone familiar with generics and interested in performance, you may have heard the refrain that \ngeneric virtual methods are relatively expensive.

It’s \nenabled by default in 64 -bit processes in .NET 7 as of dotnet/runtime#64688 , but as with other multi -\nyear features, a multitude of PRs went into making it a r', 'eality. At a 30,000 foot level, “regions” replaces \nthe current “segments” approach to managing memory on the GC heap; rather than having a few \ngigantic segments of memory (e. g. each 1GB), often associated 1:1 with a generation, the GC instead \nmaintains many, many smaller regions (e.g.  each 4MB) as their own entity. This enables the GC to be \nmore agile with regards to operations like repurposing regions of memory from one gener ation to \nano', 'ther. For more information on regions, the blog post Put a DPAD on that GC!  from the primary \ndeveloper on the GC is still the best resource.   \n72 CHAPTER 4 | Native AOT  \n CHAPTER  4 \nNative AOT  \nTo many people, the word “performance” in the context of software is about throughput. How fast \ndoes something execute? How much data per second can it process? How many requests per second \ncan it process? And so on. But there are many other facets', ' to performance. How much memory does \nit consume? How fast does it start up and get to the point of doing something useful? How much  \nspace does it consume on disk? How long would it take to download? And then there are related \nconcerns. In order to achieve these goals, what dependencies are required? What kinds of operations \ndoes it need to perform to achieve these goals, and are all o f those operations permitted in the target \nenvironment?', ' If any of this paragraph resonates with you, you are the target audience for the Native \nAOT support now shipping in .NET 7.  \n.NET has long had support for AOT code generation. For example, .NET Framewo rk had it in the form \nof ngen , and .NET Core has it in the form of crossgen . Both of those solutions involve a standard .NET \nexecutable that has some of its IL already compiled to assembly code, but not all methods will have \nassembly code g', 'enerated for the m, various things can invalidate the assembly code that was \ngenerated, external .NET assemblies without any native assembly code can be loaded, and so on, and \nin all of those cases, the runtime continues to utilize a JIT compiler. Native AOT is different. It’s an \nevolution of CoreRT, which itself was an evolution of .NET Native, and it’s entirely free of a JIT. The \nbinary that results from publishing a build is a completely s', 'tandalone executable in the target \nplatform’s platform -specific file format (e.g.  COFF on Windows, ELF on Linux, Mach -O on macOS) with \nno external dependencies other than ones standard to that platform (e.g.  libc). And it’s entirely native: \nno IL in sight, no JIT, no nothing. All required code is compiled and/or linked in to the executab le, \nincluding the same GC that’s used with standard .NET apps and services, and a minimal runtime that', ' \nprovides services around threading and the like. All of that brings great benefits: super fast startup \ntime, small and entirely -self contained deployment , and ability to run in places JIT compilers aren’t \nallowed (e.g.  because memory pages that were writable can’t then be executable). It also brings \nlimitations: no JIT means no dynamic loading of arbitrary assemblies (e.g. Assembly.LoadFile ) and no \nreflect ion emit (e.g. DynamicMethod )', ', everything compiled and linked in to the app means the more \nfunctionality that’s used (or might be used) the larger is your deployment, etc. Even with those \nlimitations, for a certain class of application, Native AOT is an in credibly exciting and welcome \naddition to .NET 7.  \nToo many PRs to mention have gone into bringing up the Native AOT stack, in part because it’s been \nin the works for years (as part of the archived dotnet/ corert  pro', 'ject and then as part of \ndotnet/runtimelab/feature/NativeAOT ) and in part because there have been over a hundred PRs just \nin dotnet/runtime  that have gone into bringing Native AOT up to a shippable state since the code was \noriginally brought over from dotnet/runtimelab  in dotnet/runtime#62563  and dotnet/runtime#62563 . \nBetween that and there not being a previous version to compare its performance to, instead of \nfocusing PR by PR on impro', 'vements, let’s just look at how to use it and the benefits it brings.   \n73 CHAPTER 4 | Native AOT  \n Today, Native AOT is focused on console applications, so let’s create a console app:  \ndotnet new console -o nativeaotexample  \nWe now have our nativeaot example  directory containing a nativeaotexample.csproj  and a “hello, \nworld” Program.cs . To enable publishing the application with Native AOT, edit the .csproj to include \nthis in the existin', 'g <PropertyGroup>...</PropertyGroup> .  \n<PublishAot> true </PublishAot>  \nAnd then… actually, that’s it. Our app is now fully configured to be able to target Native AOT. All that’s \nleft is to publish. As I’m currently writing this on my Windows x64 machine, I’ll target that:  \ndotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release  \nI now have my generated executable in the output publish directory:  \n    Directory: C: \\nativeaotexample \\bin\\Release\\net7.0\\win-x', '64\\publish \n \nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name  \n-a---           8/27/2022  6:19 PM        206182 4 nativeaotexample.exe  \n-a---           8/27/2022  6:19 PM       14290944 nativeaotexample.pdb  \nso 2M instead of 3.5MB. Of course, for that significant reduction I’ve given up some things:  \n• Setting InvariantGlobalization  to true means I’m now not respecting c ulture information and \nam instead using a set of invariant data', ' for most globalization operations.  \n• Setting UseSystemResourceKeys  to true means nice exception messages are stripped away.  \n• Setting IlcGenerateStackTraceData  to false means I’m going to get fair ly poor stack traces \nshould I need to debug an exception.  \n• Setting DebuggerSupport  to false… good luck debugging things.  \n• … you get the idea.  \nOne of the potentially mind -boggling aspects of Native AOT for a developer used to .NET is th', 'at, as it \nsays on the tin, it really is native. After publishing the app, there is no IL involved, and there’s no JIT \nthat could even process it. This makes some o f the other investments in .NET 7 all the more valuable, \nfor example everywhere investments are happening in source generators. Code that previously relied \non reflection emit for good performance will need another scheme. We can see that, for example, with  \nRegex . Historically fo', 'r optimal throughput with Regex , it’s been recommended to use \nRegexOptions.Compiled , which uses reflection emit at run -time to generate an optimized \nimplementation of the specified pattern. But if you look at the implementation of th e Regex  \nconstructor, you’ll find this nugget:  \nif (RuntimeFeature. IsDynamicCodeCompiled ) \n{ \n    factory = Compile(pattern, tree, options, matchTimeout != InfiniteMatchTimeout);  \n} \nWith the JIT, IsDynamic', 'CodeCompiled  is true. But with Native AOT, it’s false. Thus, with Native AOT \nand Regex , there’s no difference between specifying RegexOptions.Compiled  and not, and another \nmechanism is required to get the throughput benefits promised by RegexOptions.Compiled . Enter \n[GeneratedRegex(...)] , which, along with the new regex source generator shipping in the .NET 7  \n74 CHAPTER 4 | Native AOT  \n SDK, emits C# code into the assembly using it. Tha', 't C# code takes the place of the reflection emit that \nwould have happened at run -time, and is thus able to work s uccessfully with Native AOT.  \nprivate static readonly  string s_haystack = new \nHttpClient ().GetStringAsync ("https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661 -0.txt").Result; \n     \nprivate Regex _interpreter = new Regex(@"^.*elementary.*$" , RegexOptions.

And further, those constraints can actually bring further benefits. \nConsider dotnet/runtime#64497 . Remember how we talked about “guarded devirtualization” in \ndynamic PGO, where via instrumentation the JIT can determine the most likely type to be used at a \ngiven ca', 'll site and special -case it? With Native AOT, the entirety of the program is known at compile \ntime, with no support for Assembly.LoadFrom  or the like. That means at compile time, the compiler \ncan do whole -program analysis to determine what types implement what interfaces. If a gi ven \ninterface only has a single type that implements it, then every call site through that interface can be \nunconditionally devirtualized, without any type -check', ' guards.  \nThis is a really exciting space, one we expect to see flourish in coming releases.   \n75 CHAPTER 5 | Mono  \n CHAPTER  5 \nMono  \nUp until now I’ve referred to “the JIT,” “the GC,” and “the runtime,” but in reality there are actually \nmultiple runtimes in .NET. I’ve been talking about “coreclr,” which is the runtime that’s recommended \nfor use on Linux, macOS, and Windows. However, there’s also “mono,” which powers Blazor wasm \napplicati', 'ons, Android apps, and iOS apps. It’s also seen sign ificant improvements in .NET 7.  \nJust as with coreclr (which can JIT compile, AOT compile partially with JIT fallback, and fully Native \nAOT compile), mono has multiple ways of actually executing code. One of those ways is an interpreter, \nwhich enables mono to execute .NET code in environments that don’t permit JIT’ing and without \nrequiring ahead -of-time compilation or incurring any limitat', 'ions it may bring. Interestingly, though, \nthe interpreter is itself almost a full -fledged compiler, parsing the IL, gener ating its own intermediate \nrepresentation (IR) for it, and doing one or more optimization passes over that IR; it’s just that at the \nend of the pipeline when a compiler would normally emit code, the interpreter instead saves off that \ndata for it to interpr et when the time comes to run. As such, the interpreter has a very', ' similar \nconundrum to the one we discussed with coreclr’s JIT: the time it takes to optimize vs the desire to \nstart up quickly. And in .NET 7, the interpreter employs a similar solution: tie red compilation. \ndotnet/runtime#68823  adds the ability for the interpreter to initially compile with minimal \noptimization of that IR, and then once a certain threshold of call counts has been hit, then take the \ntime to do as much optimization on the IR ', 'as possible for all future invocations of that method. This \nyields the same benefits as it does for coreclr: improved startup time while also having efficient \nsustained throughput. When this merg ed, we saw improvements in Blazor wasm app startup time \nimprove by 10 -20%. Here’s one example from an app being tracked in our benchmarking system:   \n76 CHAPTER 5 | Mono  \n  \nThe interpreter isn’t just used for entire apps, though. Just as how corec', 'lr can use the JIT when an R2R \nimage doesn’t contain code for a method, mono can use the interpreter when there’s no AOT code \nfor a method. Once such case that occurred on mono was with generic delegate invocation, where the \npresence of a generic delegate being invoked would trigger fall ing back to the interpreter; for .NET 7, \nthat gap was addressed with dotnet/runtime#70653 . A more impactful case, however, is \ndotnet/runtime#64867 . Previo', 'usly, any methods with catch  or filter  exception handling clauses \ncouldn’t be AOT compiled and would fall back to being interpreted. With this PR, the method is now \nable to be AOT compiled, and it only falls back to using the inte rpreter when an exception actually \noccurs, switching over to the interpreter for the remainder of that method call’s execution. Since many \nmethods contain such clauses, this can make a big difference in throughput', ' and CPU consumption. In \nthe same vein, dotnet/runtime#63065  enabled methods with finally  exception handling clauses to \nbe AOT compiled; just the finally  block gets interpreted rather than the entire method being \ninterpreted.  \nBeyond such backend improvements, another class of improvement came from further unification \nbetween coreclr and mono. Years ago, coreclr and mono had their own entire library stack b uilt on \ntop of them. Over time', ', as .NET was open sourced, portions of mono’s stack got replaced by shared \ncomponents, bit by bit. Fast forward to today, all of the core .NET libraries above \nSystem.Private.CoreLib  are the same regardless of which runtime is  being employed. In fact, the \nsource for CoreLib  itself is almost entirely shared, with ~95% of the source files being compiled into \nthe CoreLib  that’s built for each runtime, and just a few percent of the source spe', 'cialized for each \n(these statements mean s that the vast majority of the performance improvements discussed in the \nrest of this post apply equally whether running on mono and coreclr). Even so, every release now we \ntry to chip away at that few remaining percent, for reasons of maintainability, bu t also because the \nsource used for coreclr’s CoreLib  has generally had more attention paid to it from a performance \nperspective. dotnet/runtime#71', '325 , for example, moves mono’s array and span sorting generic \nsorting utility class over to the more efficient implementation used by coreclr.  \nOne of the biggest categories of improvements, however, is in vectorization. This comes in two pieces. \nFirst, Vector<T>  and Vector128<T>  are now fully accelera ted on both x64 and Arm64, thanks to PRs \nlike dotnet/runtime#64961 , dotnet/runtime#65086 , dotnet/runtime#65128 , dotnet/runtime#66317 , \n', ' \n77 CHAPTER 5 | Mono  \n dotnet/runtime#66391 , dotnet/runtime#66409 , dotnet/runtime#66512 , dotnet/runtime#66586 , \ndotnet/runtime#66589 , dotnet/runtime#66597 , dotnet/runtime#66476 , and dotnet/runtime#67125 ; \nthat significant amount of work means all that code that gets vectorized using these abstractions will \nlight-up on mono and coreclr alike. Second, thanks primarily to dotnet/runtime#70086 , mono now \nknows how to translate Vector128<T', '>  operations to WASM’s SIMD instruction set, such that code \nvectorized with Vector128<T>  will also be accelerated when running in Blazor wasm applications and \nanywhere else WASM might be executed.   \n78 CHAPTER 6 | Reflection  \n CHAPTER  6 \nReflection  \nReflection is one of those areas you either love or hate (I find it a bit humorous to be writing this \nsection immediately after writing the Native AOT section). It’s immensely powerful, provi', 'ding the \nability to query all of the metadata for code in your pr ocess and for arbitrary assemblies you might \nencounter, to invoke arbitrary functionality dynamically, and even to emit dynamically -generated IL at \nrun-time. It’s also difficult to handle well in the face of tooling like a linker or a solution like Native \nAOT that needs to be able to determine at build time exactly what code will be executed, and it’s \ngenerally quite expensiv', 'e at run -time; thus it’s both something we strive to avoid when possible but \nalso invest in reducing the costs of, as it’s so popular in so many different kinds of applications \nbecause it is incredibly useful. As with most releases, it’s seen some nice improvements in .NET 7.  \nOne of the most impacted areas is reflection invoke. Available via MethodBase.Invoke , this \nfunctionality let’s yo u take a MethodBase  (e.g. MethodInfo ) object that ', 'represents some method for \nwhich the caller previously queried, and call it, with arbitrary arguments that the runtime needs to \nmarshal through to the callee, and with an arbitrary return value that needs t o be marshaled back. If \nyou know the signature of the method ahead of time, the best way to optimize invocation speed is to \ncreate a delegate from the MethodBase  via CreateDelegate<T>  and then use that delegate for all \nfuture invocation', 's. But in some circu mstances, you don’t know the signature at compile time, and thus \ncan’t easily rely on delegates with known matching signatures. To address this, some libraries have \ntaken to using reflection emit to generate code at run -time specific to the target method. This is \nextremely complicated and it’s not something we want apps to have to do. Instead, in .NET 7 via \ndotnet/runtime#66357 , dotnet/runtime#69575 , and dotnet/runtime', '#74614 , Invoke  will itself use \nreflection emit (in the form of DynamicMethod ) to generate a delegate that is customized for invoking \nthe target, and then future invocation via that MethodInfo  will utilize that generated method. This \ngives developers most of the performance benefits of a custom reflection emit -based implementation \nbut without having the complexity or challenges of such an implementation in their own code base.  \nprivate M', 'ethodInfo _method;  \n \n[GlobalSetup]  \npublic void Setup() => _method = typeof(Program).

The \nbedrock of this support has been “Platform Invoke,” or “P/Invoke,” represented in code by \n[DllImport(...)]  applied to methods. The DllImportAttribute  enables declaring a method that \ncan be called like any other .NET  method but that actually represents some external method that the \nruntime', ' should call when this managed method is invoked. The DllImport specifies details about in \nwhat library the function lives, what its actual name is in the exports from that library, high-level \ndetails about marshalling of input arguments and return values, and so on, and the runtime ensures \nall the right things happen. This mechanism works on all operating systems. For example, Windows \nhas a method CreatePipe  for creating an anonymous  pipe:', '  \nBOOL CreatePipe(  \n  [out]          PHANDLE               hReadPipe,  \n  [out]          PHANDLE               hWritePipe,  \n  [in, optional] LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpPipeAttributes,  \n  [in]           DWORD                 nSize  \n); \nIf I want to call this fun ction from C#, I can declare a [DllImport(...)]  counterpart to it which I can \nthen invoke as I can any other managed method:  \n[DllImport ("kernel32" , SetLastError = true)] \n[return: ', 'MarshalAs (UnmanagedType. Bool)] \nprivate static unsafe extern bool CreatePipe ( \n    out SafeFileHandle hReadPipe,  \n    out SafeFileHandle hWritePipe,  \n    void* lpPipeAttributes,  \n    uint nSize); \nThere are several interesting things to note here. Several of the arguments are directly blittable with \nthe same representation on  the managed and native side of the equation, e.g. lpPipeAttributes  is a \npointer and nSize  is a 32 -bit integer.', ' But what about the return value? The bool  type in C# \n(System.Boolean ) is a one -byte type, but the BOOL  type in the native signature is four byte s; thus code \ncalling this managed method can’t just directly invoke the native function somehow, as there needs to \nbe some “marshalling” logic that converts the four -byte return BOOL  into the one -byte return bool . \nSimiarly, the native function has two out pointers for hReadPipe  and hWritePi', 'pe , but the managed \nsignature declares two SafeFileHandle s (a SafeHandle  is a .NET type that wraps a pointer and \nprovides a finalizer and Dispose  method for ensuring that pointer is appropriately cleaned up when \nit’s no l onger being used). Some logic needs to take the output handles generated by the native \nfunction and wrap them into these SafeFileHandles  to be output from the managed method. And \nwhat about that SetLastError = true ? .', 'NET has methods like Marshal.GetLastPIn vokeError() ,  \n83 CHAPTER 7 | Interop  \n and some code somewhere needs to take any error produced by this method and ensure it’s available \nfor consumption via a subsequent GetLastPInvokeError() . \nIf there’s no marshalling logic required, such that the managed signature and native sign ature are for \nall intents and purposes the same, all arguments blittable, all return values blittable, no additional \nlo', 'gic required around the invocation of the method, etc., then a [DllImport(...)]  ends up being a \nsimple passthrough with the runtime needi ng to do very little work to implement it. If, however, the \n[DllImport(...)]  involves any of this marshalling work, the runtime needs to generate a “stub,” \ncreating a dedicated method that’s called when the [DllImport(...)]  is called, that handles fixing \nup all inputs, that delegates to the actual native', ' function, and that fixes up all of the outputs. That \nstub is generated at execution time, with the runtime effectively doing reflection emit, generating IL \ndynamically that’s then JIT’d.  \nThere are a variety  of downsides to this. First, it takes time to generate all that marshalling code, time \nwhich can then negatively impact user experience for things like startup. Second, the nature of its \nimplementation inhibits various optimizations, s', 'uch as inlining. Thi rd, there are platforms that don’t \nallow for JIT’ing due to the security exposure of allowing for dynamically generated code to then be \nexecuted (or in the case of Native AOT, where there isn’t a JIT at all). And fourth, it’s all hidden away \nmaking it more  challenging for a developer to really understand what’s going on.  \nBut what if that logic could all be generated at build time rather than at run time? The cost of \nge', 'nerating the code would be incurred only at build time and not on every execution. The cod e would \neffectively just end up being user code that has all of the C# compiler’s and runtime’s optimizations \navailable to it. The code, which then would just be part of the app, would be able to be ahead -of-time \ncompiled using whatever AOT system is desir able, whether it be crossgen or Native AOT or some \nother system. And the code would be inspectabl', 'e, viewable by users to understand exactly what work \nis being done on their behalf. Sounds pretty desirable. Sounds magical. Sounds like a job for a Roslyn \nsource generator, mentioned earlier.  \n.NET 6 included several source generators in the .NET SDK, and .NET 7 doubles down on this effort \nincluding several more. One of these is the brand new LibraryImport generator, which provides exactly \nthe magical, desirable  solution we were just discu', 'ssing.  \nLet’s return to our previous CreatePipe  example. We’ll make two small tweaks. We change the \nattribute from DllImport  to LibraryImport , and we change the extern  keyword to be partial : \n[LibraryImport ("kernel32" , SetLastError = true)] \n[return: MarshalAs (UnmanagedType. Bool)] \nprivate static unsafe partial bool CreatePipe ( \n    out SafeFileHandle hReadPipe,  \n    out SafeFileHandle hWritePipe,  \n    void* lpPipeAttributes,  \n    ', 'uint nSize); \nNow if you’re following along a t home in Visual Studio, try right -clicking on CreatePipe and selecting \nGo to Definition. That might seem a little strange. “Go to Definition? Isn’t this the definition?” This is a \npartial method, which is a way of declaring something that another partial definition fills in, and in this \ncase, a source generator in .NET 7 SDK has noticed this method with the [LibraryImport]  attribute \nand fully g', 'enerated the entire marshalling stub code in C# that’s built directly into the assembly. \nWhile by default that cod e isn’t persisted, Visual Studio still enables you to browse it (and you can  \n84 CHAPTER 7 | Interop  \n opt-in to having it persisted on disk by adding a \n<EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles>true</EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles>  property into your .csproj). \nHere’s what it currently looks like fo r that method:  \n[System.

Two SafeHandle  \ninstances are being allocated and then later after the native function completes, the \n', 'Marshal.InitHandle  method is used to store the resulting handles into these in stances (the \nallocations happen before the native function call, as performing them after the native handles have \nalready been produced increases the chances of a leak if the SafeHandle  allocation fails due to an \nout-of-memory situation). The BOOL  to bool  conversion happens via a != 0  comparison. And the error \ninformation is captured by calling Marshal.GetLast', 'SystemError()  just after the native function call \nand then Marshal.SetLastPInvokeError(int)  just prior to returning. The actual native function call \nis still implemented with a [DllImport(...)] , but now that P/Invoke is blittable and doesn’t require \nany stub to be generated by the runtime, as all that work has been handled in this C# code.  \nA sheer ton of work went in to enabling this. I touched on some of it last year in Performance \nImpr', 'ovements in .NET 6 , but a significant amount of additional effort has gone into .NET 7 to polish \nthe design and make the implemen tation robust, roll it out across all of dotnet/runtime  and beyond, \nand expose the functionality for all C# developers to use:  \n• The LibraryImport generator started its life as an experiment in dotnet/runtimelab . When it was \nready, dotnet/runtime#59579  brought 180 commits spanning years of effort into the \ndot', 'net/runtime  main branch.  \n• In .NET 6, there were almost 3000 [DllImport]  uses throughout the core .NET libraries. As of my \nwriting this, in .NET 7 there are… let me search… wait for it… 7 (I was hoping I could say 0, but \nthere are just a few stragglers, mostly related to COM interop, still remaining). That’s not a \ntransformation that happens over night. A multitude of PRs went library by library converting \nfrom the old to the new, such as', ' dotnet/runtime#62295  and dotnet/runtime#61640  for \nSystem.Private.CoreLib, dotnet/runtime#61742  and dotnet/runtime#62309  for the cryptography \nlibraries, dotnet/runtime#61765  for networking, dotnet/runtime#61996  and \ndotnet/runtime#61638  for most of the other I/O -related  libraries, and a long -tail of additional \nporting in dotnet/runtime#61975 , dotnet/runtime#61389 , dotnet/runtime#62353 , \ndotnet/runtime#61990 , dotnet/runtime#61949 ', ', dotnet/runtime#61805 , dotnet/runtime#61741 , \ndotnet/runtime#61184 , dotnet/runtime#54290 , dotnet/runtime#62365 , dotnet/runtime#61609 , \ndotnet/runtime#61532 , and dotnet/runtime#54236 . \n• Such porting is significantly easier when there’s a tool to help automate it. \ndotnet/runtime#72819  enables the analyzer and fixer for performing these transformations. \n:::{custom -style=Figure}  \n86 CHAPTER 7 | Interop  \n  ::: \nThere were plenty of oth', 'er PRs that went into making the LibraryImport generator a reality for .NET 7. \nTo highlight just a few more, dotnet/runtime#63320  introduces a new \n[DisabledRuntimeMarsh alling]  attribute that can be specified at the assembly level to disable all of \nthe runtime’s built -in marshalling; at that point, the only marshalling performed as part of interop is \nthe marshaling done in the user’s code, e.g.  that which is generated by [LibraryImport] .', ' Other PRs \nlike dotnet/runtime#67635  and dotnet/runtime#68173  added new marshaling types that encompass \ncommon m arshaling logic and can be referenced from [LibraryImport(...)]  use to customize how \nmarshaling is performed (the generator is pattern -based and allows for customization of marshalling \nby providing types that implement the right shape, which these types do  in support of the most \ncommon marshalling needs). Really usefully, dot', 'net/runtime#71989  added support for marshaling \n{ReadOnly}Span<T> , such that spans can be used directly in [LibraryImport( ...)]  method \nsignatures, just as arrays can be (examples in dotnet/runtime  are available in dotnet/runtime#73256 ). \nAnd dotnet/runtime#69043  consolidated logic to be shared between the runtime’s marshalling \nsupport in [DllImport]  and the generators support with [LibraryImport] . \nOne more category of interop -related', ' changes that I t hink are worth talking about are to do with \nSafeHandle  cleanup. As a reminder, SafeHandle  exists to mitigate various issues around managing \nnative handles and file descriptors. A native handle or file descriptor is just a memory address or \nnumber that refe rs to some owned resource and which must be cleaned up / closed when done with \nit. A SafeHandle  at its core is just a managed object that wraps such a value and provide', 's a Dispose  \nmethod and a finalizer for closing it. That way, if you neglect to Dispose  of the SafeHandle  in order to \nclose the resource, the resource will still be cleaned up when the SafeHandle  is garbage collected and \nits finalizer eventually run. SafeHandle  then also provides some synchronization around that closure, \ntrying to minimize the  possibility that the resource is closed while it’s still in use. It provides \nDangerousAddRef  ', 'and DangerousRelease  methods that increment and decrement a ref count, \nrespectively, and if Dispose  is called while the ref count is above zero, the actual releas ing of the \nhandle triggered by Dispose  is delayed until the ref count goes back to 0. When you pass a \nSafeHandle  into a P/Invoke, the generated code for that P/Invoke handles calling DangerousAddRef  \n \n87 CHAPTER 7 | Interop  \n and DangerousRelease  (and due to the wonders of Li', 'braryImport I’ve already extolled, you can easily \nsee that being done, such as in the previous generated code example). Our code tries hard to clean \nup after SafeHandle s deterministically, but it’s quite easy to accidentally l eave some for finalization.  \ndotnet/runtime#71854  added some debug -only tracking code to SafeHandle  to make it easier for \ndevelopers working in dotnet/runtime  (or more specifically, developers using a checked build', ' of the \nruntime) to find such issues. When the SafeHandle  is constructed, it captures the current stack trace, \nand if the SafeHandle  is finalized, it dumps that stack trace to the co nsole, making it easy to see \nwhere SafeHandles  that do end up getting finalized were created, in order to track them down and \nensure they’re being disposed of. As is probably evident from that PR touching over 150 files and \nalmost 1000 lines of code, there  w', 'ere quite a few places that benefited from clean up. Now to be fair, \nmany of these are on exceptional code paths. For example, consider a hypothetical P/Invoke like:  \n[LibraryImport ("SomeLibrary" , SetLastError = true)] \ninternal  static partial SafeFileHand le CreateFile (); \nand code that uses it like:  \nSafeFileHandle handle = Interop. CreateFile (); \nif (handle. IsInvalid ) \n{ \n    throw new UhOhException (Marshal. GetLastPInvokeError ());', ' \n} \nreturn handle; \nSeems straightforward enough. Except this code will actually lea ve a SafeHandle  for finalization on \nthe failure path. It doesn’t matter that SafeHandle  has an invalid handle in it, it’s still a finalizable \nobject. To deal with that, this code would have been more robustly written as:  \nSafeFileHandle handle = Interop. CreateFile(); \nif (handle. IsInvalid ) \n{ \n    int lastError = Marshal. GetLastPInvokeError (); \n    han', 'dle.Dispose(); // or handle.SetHandleAsInvalid()  \n    throw new UhOhException (lastError);  \n} \nreturn handle; \nThat way, this SafeHandle  won’t create finalization pressure even in the case of failure. Note, as well, \nthat as part of adding in the Dispose  call, I also moved the Marshal.GetLastPInvokeError()  up. \nThat’s because calling Dispose  on a SafeHandle  may end up invoking the SafeHandle ’s \nReleaseHandle  method, which the developer o', 'f the SafeHandle -derived type will have overridden to \nclose the resource, which typically involves making another P/Invoke. And if that P/Invoke has \nSetLastError=true  on it, it can overwrite the very error code  for which we’re about to throw. Hence, \nwe access and store the last error immediately after the interop call once we know it failed, then clean \nup, and only then throw. All that said, there were a myriad of places in that PR where S', 'afeHandle s \nwere being l eft for finalization even on the success path. And that PR wasn’t alone. \ndotnet/runtime#71991 , dotnet/runtime#71854 , dotnet/runtime#72116 , dotnet/runtime#72189 , \ndotnet/runtime#72222 , dotnet/runtime#72203 , and dotnet/runtime#72279  all found and fixed many \noccurrences of SafeHandle s being left for finalization (many thanks to the diagnostics put in place in \nthe earlier mentioned PR).   \n88 CHAPTER 7 | Interop  ', '\n Other PRs also accrued to improved interop performance. dotnet/runtime#70000  from \n[@huoyaoyuan](https:// github.com/huoyaoyuan) rewrote several delegate -related “FCalls” from being \nimplemented in native code to instead being managed, resulting in less overhead when invoking \nthese operations that are commonly involved in scenarios involving \nMarshal.GetDelegate ForFunctionPointer . dotnet/runtime#68694  also moved some trivial \nfunctionalit', 'y from native to managed, as part of relaxing argument validation on the use of pinning \nhandles.

In order to coordinate threads, when work items were enqueued \nand dequeued, the pool was issuing requests to its threads to let them know that there was work \navailable to d o. This, however, often resulted in oversubscription, where more threads than necessary \nwould race to try to get work items, especially when the sys', 'tem wasn’t at full load. That in turn would \nmanifest as a throughput regression. This change overhauls how t hreads are requested, such that only \none additional thread is requested at a time, and after that thread has dequeued its first work item, it \ncan issue a request for an additional thread if there’s work remaining, and then that one can issue an \nadditional request, and so on. Here’s one of our performance tests in our performance test s', 'uite (I’ve \nsimplified it down to remove a bunch of configuration options from the test, but it’s still accurately \none of those configurations). At first glance you might think , “hey, this is a performance test about \nArrayPool , why is it showing up in a threading discussion?” And, you’d be right, this is a performance \ntest that was written focused on ArrayPool . However, as mentioned earlier, threading impacts \neverything, and in this case, ', 'that await Task.Yield()  in the middle there causes the remainder of \nthis method to be queued to the ThreadPool  for execution. And because of how the test is structured, \ndoing “real work” that competes for CPU cycles with thread pool threads all racing to get their next \ntask, it shows a measurable improvement when moving to .NET 7.   \n90 CHAPTER 8 | Threading  \n private readonly  byte[][] _nestedArrays = new byte[8][]; \nprivate const int Iter', 'ations = 100_000; \n \nprivate static byte IterateAll (byte[] arr) \n{ \n    byte ret = default; \n    foreach (byte item in arr) ret = item;  \n    return ret; \n} \n \n[Benchmark (OperationsPerInvoke = Iterations)]  \npublic async Task MultipleSerial () \n{ \n    for (int i = 0; i < Iterations; i++)  \n    { \n        for (int j = 0; j < _nestedArrays.

One notable change is in the handling \nof AsyncLocal<T> s, in dotnet/runtime#68790 . AsyncLocal<T>  is integrated tightly with \nExecutio nContext ; in fact, in .NET Core, ExecutionContext  is entirely  about flowing AsyncLocal<T>  \ninstances. An ExecutionContext  instance maintains a single field, a map data structure, that stores \nthe data for all AsyncLocal<T>  with data present in that context. Each AsyncLocal<T>  has an object it \n', 'uses as a key, and any gets or sets on that AsyncLocal<T>  manifest as getting the current \nExecutionContext , looking up that AsyncLocal<T> ’s key in the context’s dictionary, and then either \nreturning whatever data it find s, or in the case of a setter, creating a new ExecutionContext  with an \nupdated dictionary and publishing that back. This dictionary thus needs to be very efficient for reads \nand writes, as developers expect AsyncLocal<T> ', ' access to be as fast as possible, o ften treating it as if \nit were any other local. So, to optimize these lookups, the representation of that dictionary changes \nbased on how many AsyncLocal<T> s are represented in this context. For up to three items, dedicated \nimplementations with fields for each of the three keys and values were used. Above that up to around \n16 elements, an array of key/value pairs was used. And above that, a Dictionary<,> ', ' was used. For the \nmost part, this has worked well, with the majority of ExecutionContext s being able to represent \nmany flows with one of the first three types. However, it turns out that four active AsyncLocal<T>  \ninstances is really common, especially in ASP.NET where ASP.NET infrastructure itself uses a couple.  \n91 CHAPTER 8 | Threading  \n So, this PR took the complexity hit to add a d edicated type for four key/value pairs, in order to \n', 'optimize from one to four of them rather than one to three.

It also times how lo ng it takes to enter and \nexit the lock, and writes a warning if it had to wait for at least 15ms. When I run this on .NET 6, I get \n~100 occurrences of it taking >= 10 ms to enter/exit the lock. On .NET 7, I get 0 occurrences. Why the \ndifference? The implem entation of ReaderWriterLockSlim  has its own spin l', 'oop implementation, and \nthat spin loop tries to mix together various things to do as it spins, ranging from calling \nThread.SpinWait  to Thread.Sleep(0)  to Thread.Sleep(1) . The issue lies in the Thread.Sleep (1). \nThat’s saying “put this thread to sleep for 1 millisecond”; however, the operating system has the \nultimate say on such timings, and on Windows, by default that sleep is going to be closer to 15 \nmilliseconds (on Linux it’s a bit low', 'er but still quite h igh). Thus, every time there was enough \ncontention on the lock to force it to call Thread.Sleep(1) , we’d incur a delay of at least 15 \nmilliseconds, if not more. The aforementioned PR fixed this by eliminating use of Thread.Sleep(1) . \nOne final threading -related change to call out: dotnet/runtime#68639 . This one is Windows specific. \nWindows has the concept of processor groups, each of which can have up to 64 cores in it', ', and by \ndefault when a pro cess runs, it’s assigned a specific processor group and can only use the cores in \nthat group. With .NET 7, the runtime flips its default so that by default it will try to use all processor \ngroups if possible.   \n93 CHAPTER 9 | Primitive Types and Numerics  \n CHAPTER  9 \nPrimitive Types and \nNumerics  \nWe’ve looked at code generation and GC, at threading and vectorization, at interop… let’s turn our \nattention to som', 'e of the fundamental types in the system.

For example, when performing an operation like \nEnum.IsDefined , Enum.GetName , or Enum.T', 'oString , the implementation consults a cache of all of the \nvalues defined on the enum. This cache includes the string name and the value for every defined \nenumeration in the Enum . It’s also sorted by value in an array, so when one of these operations is \nperformed, the code uses Array.BinarySearch  to find the index of the relevant entry. The issue with \nthat is one of overheads. Whe n it comes to algorithmic complexity, a binary search is fa', 'ster than a \nlinear search; after all, a binary search is O(log N)  whereas a linear search is O(N) . However, there’s \nalso less overhead for every step of the algorithm in a linear search, and so for  smaller values of N, it \ncan be much faster to simply do the simple thing. That’s what dotnet/runtime#57973  does for enums. \nFor enums with less than or equal to 32 defined values, the implemen tation now just does a linear \nsearch via the intern', 'al SpanHelpers.IndexOf  (the worker routine behind IndexOf  on spans, strings,  \n95 CHAPTER 9 | Primitive Types and Numerics  \n and arrays), and for enums with more than that, it does a SpanHelpers.BinarySearch  (which is the \nimplementation for Array.BinarySearch ). \nprivate DayOfWeek[] _days = Enum.

Thus the public Ticks  property returns the value \nof _dateData  but with the top two bits masked out, e.g. _dateData & 0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF . The \nequality operators were all then just comparing one Da', 'teTime ’s Ticks  against the others, such that we \neffectively get (dt1._dateData & 0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) == (dt2._dateData & \n0x3FFFFFFFF FFFFFFF) . However, as a micro -optimization that can instead be expressed more \nefficiently as ((dt1._dateData ^ dt2._dateData) << 2) == 0 .

There are \nsignificant improvements her', 'e, some which have been in the making for literally over a decade.  \nThere’s an excellent blog post from June dedicated just to generic math , so I won’t go into much \ndepth here. At a high level, however, there are now over 30 new interfaces that utilize the new C# 11 \nstatic ab stract interface methods functionality, exposing wide -ranging operations from exponentiation \nfunctions to trigonometric functions to standard numerical operators, all ', 'available via generics, such \nthat you can write one implementation that operates over the se interfaces generically and have your  \n98 CHAPTER 9 | Primitive Types and Numerics  \n code applied to any types that implement the interfaces… which all of the numerical types in .NET 7 \ndo (including not just the primitives but also, for example, BigInteger  and Complex ). A preview \nversion of this feat ure, including necessary runtime support, languag', 'e syntax, C# compiler support, \ngeneric interfaces, and interface implementations all shipped in .NET 6 and C# 10, but it wasn’t \nsupported for production use, and you had to download an experimental reference  assembly in order \nto get access. With dotnet/runtime#65731 , all of this support moved into .NET 7 as supported \nfunctionality. dotnet/runtime#66748 , dotnet/runtime#67453 , dotnet/runtime#69391 , \ndotnet/runtime#69582 , dotnet/runtime#69', '756 , and dotnet/runtime#71800  all updated the design \nand implementation based on feedbac k from usage in .NET 6 and .NET 7 previews as well as a proper \nAPI review with our API review team (a process every new API in .NET goes through before it’s \nshipped publicly). dotnet/runtime#6 7714  added support for user -defined checked  operators, a new \nC# 11 feature that enables both unchecked  and checked  variations of operators to be exposed, wit', 'h \nthe compiler picking the right one based on the checked  context. dotnet/runtime#68096  also added \nsupport for the new C# 11 unsigned right shift operator ( >>>). And dotnet/runtime#69651 , \ndotnet/runtime#67939 , dotnet/runtime#73274 , dotnet/runtime#71033 , dotnet/runtime#71010 , \ndotnet/runtime#68251 , dotnet/runtime#68217 , and dotnet/runtime#68094  all added large swaths of \nnew public surface area for various operations, all with highly', ' -efficient managed implementations, in \nmany cases based on the open source AMD Math Library . \nWhile this support is all primarily intended for external consumers, the core libraries do consume \nsome of it internally. You can see how these APIs clean up consuming code even while m aintaining \nperformance in PRs like dotnet/runtime#68226  and dotnet/runtime#68183 , which use the interfaces \nto deduplicate a bunc h of LINQ code in Enumerable .Sum', '/Average /Min/Max. There are multiple \noverloads of these methods for int, long , float , double , and decimal . The GitHub summary of the \ndiffs tells the story on how much code was able to be deleted:  \n \n \nAnother simple example c omes from the new System.Formats.Tar  library in .NET 7, which as the \nname suggests is used for reading and writing archives in any of multiple tar file formats . The tar file \nformats include integer values in octa', 'l representation, so the TarReader  class needs to parse octal \nvalues. Some of these values are 32 -bit integers, and some are 64 -bit integers. Rather than have two \nseparate ParseOctalAsUInt32  and ParseOctalAsUInt64  meth ods, dotnet/runtime#74281 ] \nconsolidated the methods into a single ParseOctal<T>  with the constraint where T : struct, \nINumber<T> . The implementation is then entirely in terms of T and can be used for either of these \nty', 'pes (plus any other types meeting the constraints, should that ever be needed). What’s particularly \ninteresting about this example is the ParseOctal<T>  method include s use of checked , e.g. value = \nchecked((value * octalFactor) + T.CreateTruncating(digit)); . This is only possible because \nC# 11 includes the aforementioned support for user-defined checked operators , enabling the generic \nmath interfaces to support both the normal and checked', ' varieties, e.g.  the IMultiplyOperators<,,>  \ninterface contains these methods:  \n \n99 CHAPTER 9 | Primitive Types and Numerics  \n static abstract  TResult operator  *(TSelf left, TO ther right);  \nstatic virtual TResult operator  checked *(TSelf left, TOther right) => left * right;  \nand the compiler will pick the appropriate one based on the context.  \nIn addition to all the existing types that get these interfaces, there are also new types . ', '\ndotnet/runtime#69204  adds the new Int128  and UInt128  types. As these types implement all of the \nrelevant generic math interfaces, they come complete with a huge number of methods, over 100 e ach, \nall of which are implemented efficiently in managed code.

Thus you see a \nfocus in every .NET release on removing as much overhead as po ssible from such scenarios, while also \nfinding ways to further optimize the concrete operations developers are commonly performing.  \nLet’s start with some new APIs that can help make writing more efficient code easier. When examining \nstring parsing/processi ng code, it’s very common to see characters examine', "d for their inclusion in \nvarious sets. For example, you might see a loop looking for characters that are ASCII digits:  \nwhile (i < str. Length) \n{ \n    if (str[i] >= '0' && str[i] <= '9') \n    { \n        i++; \n    } \n} \nor that are ASCII letters:  \nwhile (i < str. Length) \n{ \n    if ((str[i] >= 'a' && str[i] <= 'z') || (str[i] >= 'A' && str[i] <= 'Z')) \n    { \n        i++; \n    } \n} \nor other such groups. Interestingly, there’s wide -spread var", "iation in how such  checks are coded, often \ndepending on how much effort a developer put in to optimizing them, or in some cases likely not \neven recognizing that some amount of performance was being left on the table. For example, that \nsame ASCII letter check could instead b e written as:  \nwhile (i < str. Length) \n{ \n    if ((uint)((c | 0x20) - 'a') <= 'z' - 'a') \n    { \n        i++; \n    } \n} \nwhich while more “intense” is also much more con", "cise and more efficient. It’s taking advantage of a \nfew tricks. First, rather than having two c omparisons to determine whether the character is greater \nthan or equal to the lower bound and less than or equal to the upper bound, it’s doing a single \ncomparison based on the distance between the character and the lower bound ( (uint)(c - 'a') ). If \n'c' is beyond 'z', then 'c' - 'a' will be larger than 25, and the comparison will fail. If 'c' is ", "earlier  \n102 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n than 'a', then 'c' - 'a' will be negative, and casting it to uint  will then cause it to wrap around to a \nmassive number, also larger than 25, again causing the comparison to fail. Thus, we’re able to pay a \nsingle additional subtraction to avoid an entire additional comparison and branch, which is almost  \nalways a good deal. The second trick is that | 0x20 . The ASCII table has some well", " -thought -out \nrelationship s, including that upper -case 'A' and lower -case 'a' differ by only a single bit ( 'A' is \n0b1000001  and 'a' is 0b1100001 ). To go from any lowercase ASCII letter to its uppercase ASCII \nequivalent, we thus need only to & ~0x20  (to turn off that bit), and to go in the opposite direction \nfrom any uppercase ASCII letter to its lowercase ASCII equivalent, we need only to | 0x20  (to turn on \nthat bit). We can take ad", 'vantage of t his in our range check, then, by normalizing our char c to be \nlowercase, such that for the low cost of a bit twiddle, we can achieve both the lowercase and \nuppercase range checks. Of course, those tricks aren’t something we want every developer to have to \nknow and write on each use. Instead, .NET 7 exposes a bunch of new helpers on System.Char  to \nencapsulate these common checks, done in an efficient manner. char  already had met', 'hods like \nIsDigit  and IsLetter , which provided the more comprehensive Unicode mea ning of those monikers \n(e.g. there are ~320 Unicode characters categorized as “digits”). Now in .NET 7, there are also these \nhelpers:  \n• IsAsciiDigit  \n• IsAsciiHexDigit  \n• IsAsciiHexDigitLower  \n• IsAsciiHexDigitUpper  \n• IsAsciiLetter  \n• IsAsciiLetterLower  \n• IsAsciiLetterUpper  \n• IsAsciiLetterOrDigit  \nThese methods were added by dotnet/runtime#69318 , ', 'which also employed them in dozens of \nlocations where such checks were being performed across dotnet/runtime  (many of them using less -\nefficient approaches).  \nAnother new API focused on encapsulating a common pattern is the new \nMemoryExtensions.CommonPrefixLength  method, introduced by dotnet/runtime#67929 . This accepts \neither two ReadOnlySpan<T>  instances or a Span<T>  and a ReadOnlySpan<T> , and an optional \nIEqualityComparer<T> , and r', 'eturns the number of elements that are the same at the beginning of \neach input span. This is useful when you want to know the first place that two inputs differ. \ndotnet/runtime#68210  from [@gfoidl](https://github.com/gfoidl) then utili zed the new Vector128  \nfunctionality to provide a basic vectorization of the implementation. As it’s comparing two sequences \nand looking for the first place they differ, this implementation uses a neat trick, ', 'which is to have a \nsingle method implemented to compare the sequences as bytes. If the T being compared is bitwise -\nequatable and no custom equality comparer is supplied, then it reinterpret -casts the refs from the \nspans as byte  refs, and uses the single shared implementation.  \nYet another new set of APIs  are the IndexOfAnyExcept  and LastIndexOfAnyExcept  methods, \nintroduced by dotnet/runtime#67941  and used in a variety of additional ca', 'll sites by \ndotnet/runtime#71146  and dotnet/runtime#71278 . While somewhat of a mouthful, t hese methods \nare quite handy. They do what their name suggests: whereas IndexOf(T value)  searches for the first  \n103 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n occurrence of value  in the input, and whereas IndexOfAny(T value0, T value1, ...)  searches for \nthe first occurrence of any of value0 , value1 , etc. in the input, IndexOfAnyExcept(T value)  ', 'searches \nfor the first occurrence of something that’s not equal to value , and similarly IndexOfAnyExcept(T \nvalue0, T value1, ...)  searches for the first occurrence of something that’s not equal to value0 , \nvalue1 , etc. For example, let’s say you wanted to know whether an array of integers was entirely 0. \nYou can now write that as:  \nbool allZero = array. AsSpan().IndexOfAnyExcept (0) < 0; \ndotnet/runtime#734 88 vectorizes this overload, as', ' well.  \nprivate byte[] _zeros = new byte[1024]; \n \n[Benchmark (Baseline = true)] \npublic bool OpenCoded () \n{ \n    foreach (byte b in _zeros) \n    { \n        if (b != 0) \n        { \n            return false; \n        } \n    } \n \n    return true; \n} \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic bool IndexOfAnyExcept () => _zeros.

These core IndexOf{Any}  methods are used in \nhuge numbers of places, many of which are performance -sensitive, and so every release th ey get \nadditional tender -loving care. While PRs like dotnet/runtime#67811  got gains by paying very close \nattention to the assembly code being generated (in this case, ', 'tweaking some of the checks used on \nArm64 in IndexOf  and IndexOfAny  to achieve better utilization), the biggest improvements here come \nin places where either vect orization was added and none was previously employed, or where the \nvectorization scheme was overhauled for significant gain. Let’s start with dotnet/runtime#63285 , \nwhich yields huge improvemen ts for many uses of IndexOf  and LastIndexOf  for “substrings” of byte s \nand char s. P', 'reviously, given a call like str.IndexOf("hello") , the implementation would essentially \ndo the equivalent of repeatedly searching for the ‘h’, and when an ‘h’ was found, then  performing a \nSequenceEqual  to match the remainder. As you can imagine, however, it’s very easy to run into cases \nwhere the first character being searched for is very common, such that you frequently have to break \nout of the vectorized loop in order to do the full stri', 'ng comparison. Instead, the PR implements an \nalgorithm based on SIMD -friendly algorithms for substring searching . Rather than just searching for \nthe fir st character, it can instead vectorize a search for both the first and last character at appropriate \ndistances from each other. In our “hello” example, in any given input, it’s much more likely to find an  \n104 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n ‘h’ than it is to find an ‘h’ followed', ' four charact ers later by an ‘o’, and thus this implementation is able \nto stay within the vectorized loop a lot longer, garnering many fewer false positives that force it down \nthe SequenceEqual  route. The implementation also handles cases where the two characters selec ted \nare equal, in which case it’ll quickly look for another character that’s not equal in order to maximize \nthe efficiency of the search. We can see the impact of all of this', ' with a couple of examples:  \nprivate static readonly  string s_haystack = new \nHttpClient().GetStringAsync ("https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661 -0.txt").Result; \n \n[Benchmark]  \n[Arguments ("Sherlock" )] \n[Arguments ("elementary" )] \npublic int Count(string needle) \n{ \n    ReadOnlySpan< char> haystack = s_haystack;  \n    int count = 0, pos; \n    while ((pos = haystack.

At on ly 0.1% density of the starting character, the \nnew algorithm doesn’t bring much benefit, as the existin", "g algorithm that searched for the first \ncharacter alone captures pretty much all of the possible vectorization gains to be had, and we do pay \na bit of ov erhead in doing a search for both the 'S' and the 'k', whereas previously we’d have only \nsearched for the 'S'. In contrast, though, there are 54,614 'e' characters in the document, so almost \n10% of the source. In that case, .NET 7 is 20x faster than .NET 6 , taking 53us on .NET 7 to count al", "l the \n'e'’s vs 1084us on .NET 6. In this case, the new scheme yields immense gains, by vectorizing a search \nfor both the 'e' and a 'y' at the specific distance away, a combination that is much, much less \nfrequent.

Now with this PR, which is based on approaches previously used by Regex , if th e \ntarget string begins with an ASCII character, the implementation can use IndexOf  (if the character isn’t \nan ASCII letter) or IndexOfAny  (if the character is an ASCII letter) to quickly jump ahead to the first \npossible location of a match.

When ReadOnlySpan<T>  and Span<T>  came on the scene, MemoryExtensions  was \nadd', 'ed to provide extension methods for spans and friends, including such \nIndexOf /IndexOfAny /LastIndexOf /LastIndexOfAny  methods. But for spans, this is about more than \njust char , and so MemoryExtensions  grew its  own set of implementations largely separate from \nstring ’s. Over the years, MemoryExtensions  implementations have specialized more and more types, \nbut in particular byte  and char , such that over time string ’s implementations ha', 've mostly been \nreplaced by de legation into the same implementation as MemoryExtensions  uses. However, \nIndexOfAny  and LastIndexOfAny  had been unification holdouts, each in its own direction. \nstring.IndexOfAny  did delegate to the same implementation as MemoryExtensions.IndexOfAny  for \n1-5 values being searched for, but for more than 5 values, string.IndexOfAny  used a “probabilistic \nmap,” essentially a Bloom filter . It creates a 256 -bit', ' table, and quickly sets bits in that table  based on \nthe values being searched for (essentially hashing them, but with a trivial hash function). Then it \niterates through the input, and rather than checking every input character against every one of the \ntarget values, it instead first looks up the i nput character in the table. If the corresponding bit isn’t set, \nit knows the input character doesn’t match any of the target values. If the corr', 'esponding bit is set, \nthen it proceeds to compare the input character against each of the target values, with a  high \nprobability of it being one of them.

The result is beautiful. Making it even \nbetter is dotnet/runtime#66095 , which adds to this support f or OrdinalIgnoreCase . Remember those \nASCII bit twiddling tricks discussed a bit earlier with char.IsAsciiLetter  and friends? The JIT now \nemploys the same trick as part of this unrolling, so if you do that same \nvalue.StartsWith("https', '://")  but instead as value.StartsWith("https://", \nStringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) , it will recognize that the whole comparison string is ASCII \nand will OR in the appropriate mask on both the comparison constant and on the read data from the \ninput in order to perform the comp arison in a case -insensitive manner.  \nprivate string _value = "https://dot.net" ; \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic bool IsHttps_Ordinal () => _value.

However, the source generator has problems with such \nan optimization, due to endianness. The constants being compared against are subject to byte \nordering issues, such that the source generator would need to emit code that co uld handle running \non either litt', 'le -endian or big -endian machines. The JIT has no such problem, as it’s generating the \ncode on the same machine on which the code will execute (and in scenarios where it’s being used to \ngenerate code ahead of time, the entir ety of that code is already tied to a particular architecture). By \nmoving this optimization into the JIT, the corresponding code could be deleted from \nRegexOptions.Compiled  and the regex source generator, which then als', 'o benefits from producing  \n110 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n much easier  to read code utilizing StartsWith  that’s just as fast ( dotnet/runtime#65222  and \ndotnet/runtime#66339 ).

The actual System.String ', ' class \nrepresents this in C# as an int _stringLength  field followed by a char _firstChar  field, such that \n_firstChar  indeed lines up with the first character of the string, or the null terminator if the string is \nempty. Internally in System.Private.CoreLib, and in particular in methods on string  itself, code will \noften refer to _firstChar  directly when the first charact er needs to be consulted, as it’s typically faster \nto do that than ', 'to use str[0] , in particular because there are no bounds checks involved and the \nstring’s length generally needn’t be consulted. Now, consider a method like public bool \nStartsWith(char valu e) on string . In .NET 6, the implementation was:  \nreturn Length != 0 && _firstChar == value;  \nwhich given what I just described makes sense: if the Length  is 0, then the string doesn’t begin with \nthe specified character, and if Length  is not 0, then w', "e can j ust compare the value against \n_firstChar . But, why is that Length  check even needed at all? Couldn’t we just do return \n_firstChar == value; ? That will avoid the additional comparison and branch, and it will work just \nfine… unless the target character is it self '\\0', in which case we could get false positives on the result. \nNow to this PR. The PR introduces an internal JIT intrinsinc RuntimeHelpers.IsKnownConstant , which \nthe JIT ", 'will substitute with true  if the containing method is inlined and the argument p assed to \nIsKnownConstant  is then seen to be a constant. In such cases, the implementation can rely on other \nJIT optimizations kicking in and optimizing various code in the method, effectively enabling a \ndeveloper to write two different implementations, one  when the argument is known to be a constant \nand one when not.

Such \noperations have  also improved in a variety of ways in .NET 7. Base64 -encoding , for example, is a way \nof representing arbitrary binary data (think byte[] ) across mediums that only support text, encoding \nbytes into o', 'n e of 64 different ASCII characters. Multiple APIs in .NET implement this encoding. For \nconverting between binary data represented as ReadOnlySpan<byte>  and UTF8 (actually ASCII) \nencoded data also represented as ReadOnlySpan<byte> , the System.Buffers.Text.B ase64  type \nprovides EncodeToUtf8  and DecodeFromUtf8  methods. These were vectorized several releases ago, \nbut they were further improved in .NET 7 via dotnet/runtime#70654  from \n[@a7', '4nh](https:/ /github.com/a74nh), which converted the SSSE3 -based implementation to use \nVector128<T>  (which in turn implicitly enabled vectorization on Arm64). However, for converting \nbetween arbitrary binary data represented as ReadOnlySpan<byte> /byte[]  and \nReadOnlySpa n<char> /char[] /string , the System.Convert  type exposes multiple methods, e.g. \nConvert.ToBase64String , and these methods historically were not vectorized. That changes ', 'in .NET \n7, where dotnet/r untime#71795  and dotnet/runtime#73320  vectorize the ToBase64String , \nToBase64CharArray , and TryToBase64Chars  methods. The way they do this is interesting. Rather than \neffectively duplicating th e vectorization implementation from Base64.EncodeToUtf8 , they instead \nlayer on top of EncodeToUtf8 , calling it to encode the input byte  data into an output Span<byte> . \nThen, then they “widen” those bytes into chars (r', 'emember, Base64 -encoded data is a set o f ASCII \nchars, so going from these bytes to chars entails adding just a 0 byte onto each element). That \nwidening can itself easily be done in a vectorized manner. The other interesting thing about this \nlayering is it doesn’t actually require separate inter mediate storage for the encoded bytes. The \nimplementation can perfectly compute the number of resulting characters for encoding X bytes into Y  \n113', ' CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n Base64 characters (there’s a formula), and the implementation can either allocate that final space \n(e.g. in the c ase of ToBase64CharArray) or ensure the provided space is sufficient (e.g.  in the case of \nTryToBase64Chars). And since we know the initial encoding will require exactly half as many bytes, we \ncan encode into that same space (with the destination span reint erpreted as a byte  span rather', ' than \nchar  span), and then widen “in place”: walk from the end of the bytes and the end of the char space, \ncopying the bytes into the destination.  \nprivate byte[] _data = Encoding.

While this method was previously vectorized, its primary \nfast-path utilized SSE2 and thus didn’t apply to Arm64; thanks to dotnet/runtime#70080  from \n[@SwapnilGaikwad](https://github.com/SwapnilGaikwad), that path was changed over to be based on \nthe cross -platform', ' Vector128<T> , enabling the same level of optimization across supported \nplatforms.

Rather, the natural type of this expression is a \nReadOnlySpan<byte> . If you write:  \npublic static ReadOnlySpan< byte> Text => "hello"u8; \nthe C# compiler will compile ', "that equivalent to if you wrote:  \npublic static ReadOnlySpan< byte> Text =>  \n    new ReadOnlySpan< byte>(new byte[] { (byte)'h', (byte)'e', (byte)'l', (byte)'l', \n(byte)'o', (byte)'\\0' }, 0, 5);     \nIn other words, the compiler is doing the equivalent of Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes  at compile -time and \nhardcoding the resulting bytes, saving the cost of performing that encoding at run -time.

One interesting change is dotnet/runtime#64405 , which achieved two related \nthings. The first was to remov e pinning as part of formatting operations. As', ' an example, \nStringBuilder  has an Append(char* value, int valueCount)  overload which copies the specified \nnumber of characters from the specified pointer into the StringBuilder , and other APIs were \nimplemented in terms of this method; for example, the Append(string? value, int startIndex, \nint count)  method was essentially implemented as:  \nfixed (char* ptr = value)  \n{ \n    Append(ptr + startIndex, count);  \n} \nThat fixed  statement trans', 'lates into a “pinning pointer.” Normally the GC is free to move managed \nobjects around on the heap, which it might do in order to compact the heap (to, for example, avoid \nsmall, unusuable fragments of memory between objects). But if the GC can move objects around, a \nnormal native pointer into that memory would be terribly unsafe and unreliable, as without notice the \ndata being pointed to could move and your pointer could now be pointing to ga', 'rbage or to some \nother object that was shifted to this location. There are two ways for dealing with this. The first is a \n“managed pointer,” otherwise known as a “reference” or “ref,” as that’s exactly what you get when you \nhave the “ref” keyword in C#; it’s a pointer that the runtime will update with the  correct value when it \nmoves the object being pointed into. The second is to prevent the pointed -to object from being \nmoved, “pinning” it', ' in place. And that’s what the “fixed” keyword does, pinning the referenced object \nfor the duration of the fixed  block,  during which time it’s safe to use the supplied pointer. Thankfully, \npinning is cheap when no GC occurs; when a GC does occur, however, pinned objects aren’t able to be \nmoved around, and thus pinning can have a global impact on the performance of the appl ication (and \non GCs themselves). There are also various optimization', 's inhibited by pinning. With all of the advents \nin C# around being able to use ref in many more places (e.g.  ref locals, ref returns, and now in C# 11, \nref fields), and with all of the new  APIs in .NET for manipulating refs (e.g. Unsafe.Add , \nUnsafe.AreSame ), it’s now possible to rewrite code that was using pinning pointers to instead use \nmanaged pointers, thereby avoiding the problems that come from pinning. Which is what this PR did. \nRa', 'ther than implementing all of the Append  methods in terms of an Append(char*, int)  helper, \nthey’re now all implemented in terms of an Append(ref char, int)  helper. So for example instead of \nthe previously shown Append(string? value, int startIndex, int count)  implementation, it’s \nnow akin to  \nAppend(ref Unsafe.Add(ref value.GetRawStringData (), startIndex), count);  \nwhere that string.GetRawStringData  method is just an internal version o', 'f the public \nstring.GetPinnableReference  method, returning a ref instead of a ref readonly . This means that \nall of the high -performance code insid e of StringBuilder  that had been using pointers to avoid \nbounds checking and the like can continue to do so, but now also does so without pinning all of the \ninputs.   \n117 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n The second thing this StringBuilder  change did was unify an optimization that w', 'as present f or \nstring  inputs to also apply to char[]  inputs and ReadOnlySpan<char>  inputs. Specifically, because \nit’s so common to append string  instances to a StringBuilder , a special code path was long ago \nput in place to optimize for this input and specifically for  the case where there’s already enough room \nin the StringBuilder  to hold the whole input, at which point an efficient copy can be used. With a \nshared Append(ref char, in', 't)  helper, though, this optimization can be moved down into that \nhelper, such that it n ot only helps out string  but any other type that also calls into the same helper. \nThe effects of this are visible in a simple microbenchmark:  \nprivate StringBuilder _sb = new StringBuilder (); \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic void AppendSpan () \n{ \n    _sb.Clear(); \n    _sb.Append("this".AsSpan()); \n    _sb.Append("is".AsSpan()); \n    _sb.Append("a".AsSpan()); \n  ', '  _sb.Append("test".AsSpan()); \n    _sb.Append(".".AsSpan()); \n} \nMethod  Runtime  Mean  Ratio  \nAppendSpan  .NET 6.0  35.98 ns  1.00 \nAppendSpan  .NET 7.0  17.59 ns  0.49 \nOne of the great things about improving things low in the stack is they have a multiplicative effect; \nthey not only help improve the performance of user code that directly relies on the improved \nfunctionality, they can also help improve the performance of other code in the c', 'ore libraries, which \nthen further helps dependent apps and services.

Several of the \ncore libraries, including System.Private.CoreLib, have an i nternal StringBuilderCache  type which \ncaches a StringBuilder  instance in a [ThreadStatic] , meaning every thread could end up having \nsuch an instance. There are several issues with this, including that the buffers employed by \nStringBuilder', '  aren’t usable for  anything else while the StringBuilder  isn’t in use, and because of \nthat, StringBuilderCache  places a limit on the capacity of the StringBuilder  instances that can be \ncached; attempts to cache ones longer than that result in them being thrown away. It’d be  better \ninstead to use cached arrays that aren’t length -limited and that everyone has access to for sharing. \nMany of the core .NET libraries have an internal ValueSt', 'ringBuilder  type for this purpose, a ref \nstruct -based type that can use stackalloc ’d memory  to start and then if necessary grow into \nArrayPool<char>  arrays. And with dotnet/runtime#64522  and dotnet/runtime#69683 , many o f the  \n120 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n remaining uses of StringBuilderCache  have been replaced. I’m hopeful we can entirely remove \nStringBuilderCache  in the future.  \nIn the same vein of not doing unnec', 'essary work, there’s a fairly common pattern that shows up with \nmethods like string.Subst ring  and span.Slice : \nspan = span. Slice(offset, str. Length - offset);  \nThe relevant thing to recognize here is these methods have overloads that take just the starting offset. \nSince the length being specified is the remainder after the specified offset, the call could instead be \nsimplified to:  \nspan = span. Slice(offset);  \nwhich is not only more re', 'adable and maintainable, it has some small efficiency benefits, e.g.  on 64 -bit \nthe Slice(int, int)  constructor has an extra addition over Slice(int) , and for 32 -bit the \nSlice(int, int)  constructor incurs an additional comparison and branch. It’s thus beneficial for both \ncode maintenance and for performance to simplify these calls, which dotnet/runtime#68937  does for \nall found occurrences of that pattern. This is then made more impactfu', 'l by dotnet/runtime#73882 , \nwhich streamline s string.Substring  to remove unnecessary overheads, e.g.  it condenses four \nargument validation checks down to a single fast -path comparison (in 64 -bit processes).  \nOk, enough about string . What about spans? One of the coolest features in C# 11 is the new su pport \nfor ref fields. What is a ref field? You’re familiar with refs in C# in general, and we’ve already \ndiscussed how they’re essentiall', 'y managed pointers, i.e.  pointers that the runtime can update at any \ntime due to the object it references getting moved  on the heap. These references can point to the \nbeginning of an object, or they can point somewhere inside the object, in which case they’re referred \nto as “interior pointers.” ref has existed in C# since 1.0, but at that time it was primarily about passin g \nby reference to method calls, e.g.  \nclass Data \n{ \n    public int', ' Value; \n} \n... \nvoid Add(ref int i) \n{ \n    i++; \n} \n... \nvar d = new Data { Value = 42 }; \nAdd(ref d.Value); \nDebug.Assert(d.Value == 43); \nLater versions of C# added the ability to have local refs, e.g.  \nvoid Add(ref int i) \n{ \n    ref j = ref i; \n    j++; \n} \nand even to have ref returns, e.g.   \n121 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n ref int Add(ref int i) \n{ \n    ref j = ref i; \n    j++; \n    return ref j; \n} \nThese facilities are ', 'more advanc ed, but they’re used liberally throughout higher -performance code \nbases, and many of the optimizations in .NET in recent years are possible in large part due to these \nref-related capabilities.  \nSpan<T>  and ReadOnlySpan<T>  themselves are heavily -based on refs. For example, the indexer on \nmany older collection types is implemented as a get/set property, e.g.  \nprivate T[] _items;  \n... \npublic T this[int i] \n{ \n    get => _items', '[i];  \n    set => _items[i] = value;  \n} \nBut not span. Span<T> ’s indexer looks more like this: \npublic ref T this[int index] \n{ \n    get \n    { \n        if ((uint)index >= ( uint)_length)  \n            ThrowHelper. ThrowIndexOutOfRangeException (); \n \n        return ref Unsafe.Add(ref _reference, index);  \n    } \n} \nNote there’s only a getter and no setter; t hat’s because it returns a ref T  to the actual storage \nlocation. It’s a writable ref', ', so you can assign to it, e.g.  you can write:  \nspan[i] = value;  \nbut rather than that being equivalent to calling some setter:  \nspan.set_Item (i, value);  \nit’s actually equivalent to using the getter to retrieve the ref and then writing a value through that \nref, e.g. \nref T item = ref span.get_Item (i); \nitem = value;  \nThat’s all well and good, but what’s that _reference  in the getter defin ition? Well, Span<T>  is really \njust a tuple o', 'f two fields: a reference (to the start of the memory being referred to) and a length (how \nmany elements from that reference are included in the span). In the past, the runtime had to hack this \nwith an internal type (ByReference<T> ) specially recognized by the runtime to be a reference. But as \nof C# 11 and .NET 7, ref structs  can now contain ref fields, which means Span<T>  today is literally \ndefined as follows:   \n122 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, ', 'Strings, and Spans  \n public readonly  ref struct Span<T> \n{ \n    internal  readonly ref T _reference;  \n    private readonly  int _length;  \n    ... \n} \nThe rollout of ref fields throughout dotnet/runtime  was done in dotnet /runtime#71498 , following the \nC# language gaining this support primarily in dotnet/roslyn#62155 , which itself was the culmination \nof many PRs first into a feature branch. ref fields alone doesn ’t itself automatically im', 'prove \nperformance, but it does simplify code significantly, and it allows for both new custom code that uses \nref fields as well as new APIs that take advantage of them, both of which can help with performance \n(and specifically per formance without sacrificing potential safety). One such example of a new API is \nnew constructors on ReadOnlySpan<T>  and Span<T> : \npublic Span(ref T reference);  \npublic ReadOnlySpan (in T reference);  \nadded in d', 'otnet/runtime#67447  (and then made public and used more broadly in \ndotnet/runtime#71589 ). This may beg the question, why does ref field support enable two new \nconstructors that take refs, considering spans already were able to store a ref? After all, the \nMemoryMarshal.CreateSpan(ref T reference, int length)  and corresponding \nCreateReadOnlySpan  methods have existed for as long as spa ns have, and these new constructors are \nequivalent to c', 'alling those methods with a length of 1. The answer is: safety.  \nImagine if you could willy -nilly call this constructor. You’d be able to write code like this:  \npublic Span<int> RuhRoh() \n{ \n    int i = 42; \n    return new Span<int>(ref i); \n} \nAt this point the caller of this method is handed a span that refers to garbage; that’s bad in code \nthat’s intended to be safe. You can already accomplish the same thing by using pointers:  \npublic Spa', "n<int> RuhRoh() \n{ \n    unsafe \n    { \n        int i = 42; \n        return new Span<int>(&i, 1); \n    } \n} \nbut at that point you’ve taken on the risk of using unsafe code and pointers and any resulting \nproblems are on you. With C# 11, if you now try to write the above code using the ref-based \nconstructor, you’ll be greeted with an error like this:  \nerror CS8347:  Cannot use a result of 'Span<int>.Span(ref int)' in this context because it \nmay", " expose variables referenced by parameter 'reference' outside of their declaration scope  \nIn other words, the compiler now understands that Span<int>  as a ref struct  could be st oring the \npassed in ref, and if it does store it (which Span<T>  does), this is akin to passing a ref to a local out  \n123 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n of the method, which is bad. Hence how this relates to ref fields: because ref fields are now a thing,", ' \nthe compiler’s rules for safe -handlin g of refs have been updated, which in turn enables us to expose \nthe aforementioned constructors on {ReadOnly}Span<T> . \nAs is often the case, addressing one issue kicks the can down the road a bit and exposes another. The \ncompiler now believes that a ref passed to a method on a ref struct  could enable that ref struct  \ninstance to store the ref (note that this was already the case with ref struct s pass', 'ed to methods on \nref structs ), but what if we don’t want that? What if we want to be able to say “this ref is not \nstorable and should not escape the calling scope”? From a caller’s perspective, we want the compiler \nto allow passing in such refs without it complaining about potential extension of lifetime, and from a \ncallee’s perspective, we want the compiler to pre vent the method from doing what it’s not supposed \nto do. Enter scoped . The ', 'new C# keyword does exactly what we just wished for: put it on a ref or ref \nstruct  parameter, and the compiler both will guarantee (short of using unsafe code) that the method \ncan’t  stash away the argument and will then enable the caller to write code that relies on that \nguarantee. For example, consider this program:  \nvar writer = new SpanWriter (stackalloc  char[128]); \nAppend(ref writer, 123); \nwriter.Write("."); \nAppend(ref writer, 45); ', '\nConsole. WriteLine (writer. AsSpan().ToString ()); \n \nstatic void Append(ref SpanWriter builder, byte value) \n{ \n    Span<char> tmp = stackalloc  char[3]; \n    value.TryFormat (tmp, out int charsWritten);  \n    builder. Write(tmp.Slice(0, charsWritten));  \n} \n \nref struct SpanWriter  \n{ \n    private readonly  Span<char> _chars;  \n    private int _length;  \n \n    public SpanWriter (Span<char> destination) => _chars = destination;  \n \n    public S', 'pan<char> AsSpan() => _chars. Slice(0, _length);  \n \n    public void Write(ReadOnlySpan< char> value)  \n    { \n        if (_length > _chars. Length - value.Length) \n        { \n            throw new InvalidOperationException ("Not enough remaining space" ); \n        } \n \n        value.CopyTo(_chars. Slice(_length));  \n        _length += value. Length; \n    } \n} \nWe have a ref struct SpanWriter  that takes a Span<char>  to its constructor and allow', 's for writing \nto it by copying in additional content and then updating the stored length. The Write  method accepts \na ReadOnlySpan<char> . And we then have a h elper Append  method which is formatting a byte  into \nsome stackalloc ’d temporary space and passing the resulting formatted char s in to Write . \nStraightforward. Except, this doesn’t compile:   \n124 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n error CS8350: This combination of arguments', " to 'SpanWriter.Write(ReadOnlySpan<char>)' is \ndisallowed because it may expose variables referenced by parameter 'value' outside of their \ndeclaration scope  \nWhat do we do? The Write  method doesn’t actually store the value  parameter and won’t ever need \nto, so we  can change the signature of the method to annotate it as scoped : \npublic void Write(scoped ReadOnlySpan< char> value)  \nIf Write  were then to try to store value , the compiler wou", "ld balk:  \nerror CS8352: Cannot use variable 'ReadOnlySpan<char>' in this context b ecause it may \nexpose referenced variables outside of their declaration scope  \nBut as it’s not trying to do so, everything now compiles successfully. You can see examples of how this \nis utilized in the aforementioned dotnet/runtime#71589 . \nThere’s also the other direction: there are some things that are implicitly scoped , like the this  \nreference on a struct.", " Consider this code:  \npublic struct SingleItemList  \n{ \n    private int _value; \n     \n    public ref int this[int i] \n    { \n        get \n        { \n            if (i != 0) throw new IndexOutOfRangeException (); \n             \n            return ref _value; \n        } \n    } \n} \nThis produces a compiler error:  \nerror CS8170: Struct members cannot return 'this' or other instance members by reference  \nEffectively, that’s because this  is implic", 'itly scoped  (even though that keyword wasn’t previously \navailable). What if we want to enable such an item to be returned? Enter [UnscopedRef] . This is rare \nenough in n eed that it doesn’t get its own C# language keyword, but the C# compiler does recognize \nthe new [UnscopedRef]  attribute. It can be put onto relevant parameters but also onto methods and \nproperties, in which case it applies to the this  reference for that me mber. As such, w', 'e can modify our \nprevious code example to be:  \n[UnscopedRef]  \npublic ref int this[int i] \nand now the code will compile successfully. Of course, this also places demands on callers of this \nmethod. For a call site, the compiler sees the [UnscopedRef]  on the member being invoked, and then \nknows that the returned ref might reference something from that struct, and thus assigns to the \nreturned ref the same lifetime as that struct. So, if that ', 'struct were a local living on the stack, the ref \nwould a lso be limited to that same method.   \n125 CHAPTER 10 | Arrays, Strings, and Spans  \n Another impactful span -related change comes in dotnet/runtime#70095  from [@teo -\ntsirpanis](https://github.com/teo -tsirpanis). System.HashCode ’s goal is to pr ovide a fast, easy -to-use \nimplementation for producing high -quality hash codes. In its current incarnation, it incorporates a \nrandom proces', 's -wide seed and is an implementation of the xxHash32 non -cryptographic hash \nalgorithm. In a previous release, HashCode saw the addition of an AddBytes  methods, which accepts a \nReadOnlySpan<byte>  and is useful for incorporating sequences of data that should be part of a type’s \nhash code, e.g. BigInteger.GetHashCode  includes all the data that makes up the BigInteger . The \nxxHash32 algorithm works by accumulating 4 32 -bit unsigned integers', ' and then combining them \ntogether into the hash code; thus if you call HashCode.Add(int) , the first three times you  call it you’re \njust storing the values separately into the instance, and then the fourth time you call it all of those \nvalues are combined into the hash code (and there’s a separate process that incorporates any \nremaining values if the number of 32 -bit va lues added wasn’t an exact multiple of 4). Thus, previously \nAddBytes  ', 'was simply implemented to repeatedly read the next 4 bytes from the input span and call \nAdd(int)  with those bytes as an integer. But those Add calls have overhead. Instead, this PR skips the \nAdd calls and directly handles the accumulation and combining of the 16 bytes. Interestingly, it still has \nto deal with the possibility that previous calls to Add may have left some state queued, which means \n(with the current implementation at least), if', ' there are multiple pieces of state to include in the hash \ncode, say a ReadOnlySpan<byte>  and an additional int, it’s more efficient to add the span first and \nthen the int rather than the other way around. So for example when dotnet/runtime#71274  from \n[@huoyaoyuan](https://github.com/huoyaoyuan) changed BigInteger.GetHashCode  to use \nHashCode.AddBytes , it coded the method to first call AddBytes  with the BigInteger ’s _bits  and then \ncall', ' Add with the _sign . \nprivate byte[] _data = Enumerable.

Why avoid cached arrays? After all, isn’t it desirable to cache an array once and \nreuse it over and over again? It is, if that’s the best option, but sometimes there are better options. For  \nexample, one of the changes took code like:  \nprivate static readonly  char[] s_pathDelims = { ':', '\\\\', '/', '?', '#' }; \n... \nint index = value. IndexOfAny (s_pathDelims);  \nand replaced it with code like:  \nint index = value.

There’s the usability benefit of keeping the tokens being searched close \nto the use site, and the usability benefit of the list being immutable such that some code somewhere \nwon’t accidentally replace a value in the array. But the re are also performance benefits. We don’t need \nan extra field to store the array. We don’t need to allocate the array as', ' part of this type’s static \nconstructor. And loading/using the string is slightly faster.  \nprivate static readonly  char[] s_pathDelims = { \':\', \'\\\\\', \'/\', \'?\', \'#\' }; \nprivate static readonly  string s_value = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" ; \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic int WithArray () => s_value.

This is taking advantage of the ne w C# 11 feature that supports switching on \nReadOnlySpan<char> s just as you can switch on string s, added in dotnet/roslyn#44388  from \n[@YairHalbersta', "dt](https://github.com/YairHalberstadt). dotnet/runtime#68831  also took advantage \nof this in several additional places.  \nOf course, in some cases the arrays are entirely un necessary.

Multiple other PRs similarly removed array allocations. \ndotnet/runtime#60409  removed a single -char array that was cache d to be able to pass it to \nstring.Split  and replaced it with usage of the Split  overload that directly accepts a single char . \nFinally, dotnet/runtime#59670  from [@NewellClark', '](https://github.c om/NewellClark) got rid of even \nmore arrays. We saw earlier how the C# compiler special -cases byte[] s constructed with a constant \nlength and constant elements and that’s immediately cast to a ReadOnlySpan<byte> .

It has two primary modes of \nexecution, one that relies on DFAs (deterministic finite automata) and one that relies on NFAs (non -\ndeterministic finite automata). Both impl ementations provide a very valuable guarantee: processing \ntime is linear in the length of the input. Whereas a backtracking engine (which is what Regex  uses if \nNonBacktracking  isn’t specified) can hit a situation known as “catastrophic backtracking,” w', 'here  \nproblematic expressions combined with problematic input can result in exponential processing in the \nlength of the input, NonBacktracking  guarantees it’ll only ever do an ammortized -constant amount \nof work per character in the input. In the case of a DFA, that constant is very small. With an NFA, that \nconstant can be much larger, based on the complexity of the pattern, but for any given pattern the \nwork is still linear in the length o', 'f the input.  \nA significant number of years of development went into the NonBacktracking  implementation, which \nwas initially added into dotnet/runtime  in dotnet/runtime#60607 . However, the original research and \nimplementation for it actually came from Microsoft Research (MSR), and was available as an \nexperimental package in the form of the Symbolic Regex Matcher (SRM) library published by MSR. \nYou can still see vestiges of this in the cur', 'rent code now in .NET 7, but it’s evolved significantly, in \ntight collaboration between developers on the .NET team and the researchers at MSR (prior to being \nintegrated in dotnet/runtime , it was incubated for over a year in dotnet/runtimelab , where the original \nSRM code was brought in via dotnet/runtimelab#588  from [@veanes](https://github.com/veanes)).  \nThis i mplementation is based on the notion of regular expression derivatives, a conc', 'ept that’s been \naround for decades (the term was originally coined in a paper by Janusz Brzozowski in the 1960s) and \nwhich has been significantly advanced for this implementation . Regex derivatives form the basis for \nhow the automata (think “graph”) used to process input are constructed. The idea at its core is fairly \nsimple: take a regex and process a single character… what is the new regex you get to describe what \nremains after processing', ' that one character? That’s the derivative. For example, given the regex \\w{3}   \n129 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n to match three word characters, if you apply this to the next input character ‘a’, well, that will strip off \nthe first \\w, leaving us with the derivative \\w{2} . Simple , right? How about something more \ncomplicated, like the expression .*(the|he) . What happens if the next character is a t? Well, it’s \npossible that t could be consumed by', ' the .* at the beginning of the pattern, in which case the \nremaining regex would be exa ctly the same as the starting one ( .*(the|he) ), since after matching t \nwe could still match exactly the same input as without the t. But, the t could have also been part of \nmatching the, and applied to the, we’d strip off the t and be left with he, so now our derivative is \n.*(the|he)|he . Then what about the he in the original alternation? t doesn’t matc', 'h h, so the \nderivative would be nothing, which we’ll express here as an empty character class, giving us \n.*(the|he)|he|[] . Of course, as part of an alternati on, that “nothing” at the end is a nop, and so we \ncan simplify the whole derivative to just .*(the|he)|he … done. That was all when applying the \noriginal pattern against a next t. What if it was against an h instead? Following the same logic as for \nthe t, this time we end up with .*(th', 'e|he)|e . And so on. What if we instead start with the h \nderivative and the next character is an e? Then we’re taking the pattern .*(the|he)|e  and applying it \nto e. Against the left side of the alternation, it can be consumed by  the .* (but doesn’t match either t \nor h), and so we just end up with that same subexpression. But against the right side of the \nalternation, e matches e, leaving us with the empty string (): .*(the|he)|() . At the p', 'oint where a \npattern is “nullable” (it ca n match the empty string), that can be considered a match. We can visualize \nthis whole thing as a graph, with transitions for every input character to the derivative that comes \nfrom applying it.   \n130 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n  \n \n131 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n Looks an awful lot like a DFA, doesn’t it? It should. And that’s exactly how NonBacktracking  \nconstructs the DFAs it uses to process input. For every ', 'regex construct (concatenations, alternations, \nloops, etc.) the engine knows how to derive the next regex b ased on the character being evaluated. \nThis application is done lazily, so we have an initial starting state (the original pattern), and then when \nwe evaluate the next character in the input, it looks to see whether there’s already a derivative \navailable f or that transition: if there is, it follows it, and if there isn’t, it dynamicall', 'y/lazily derives the \nnext node in the graph. At its core, that’s how it works.  \nOf course, the devil is in the details and there’s a ton of complication and engineering smarts that go \ninto making the engine efficient. One such example is a tradeoff between memory consumption and \nthroughput. Given the ability to have any char  as input, you could have effectively ~65K transitions \nout of every node (e.g.  every node could need a ~65 K element ', 'table); that would significantly increase \nmemory consumption. However, if you actually had that many transitions, it’s very likely a significant \nmajority of them would point to the same target node. Thus, NonBacktracking  maintains its own \ngroupin gs of characters into what it calls “minterms.” If two characters will have exactly the same \ntransition, they’re part of the same minterm. The transitions are then constructed in terms of \nminterms,', ' with at most one transition per minterm out of a given nod e. When the next input character \nis read, it maps that to a minterm ID, and then finds the appropriate transition for that ID; one \nadditional level of indirection in order to save a potentially huge amount of memory. That mapping is \nhandled via an array bi tmap for ASCII and an efficient data structure known as a Binary Decision \nDiagram (BDD)  for everything above 0x7F.  \nAs noted, t', 'he non -backtracking engine is linear in the length of the  input. But that doesn’t mean it \nalways looks at each input character exactly once. If you call Regex.IsMatch , it does; after all, IsMatch  \nonly needs to determine whether there is a match and doesn’t need to compute any additional \ninformation, such as wher e the match actual starts or ends, any information on captures, etc. Thus, the \nengine can simply employ its automata to walk alo', 'ng the input, transitioning from node to node in \nthe graph until it comes to a final state or runs out of input. Other operation s, however, do require it \nto gather more information. Regex.Match  needs to compute everything, and that can actually entail \nmultiple walks over the input. In the initial implementation, the equivalent of Match  would always take \nthree passes: match forwards  to find the end of a match, then match a reversed -copy o', 'f the pattern in \nreverse from that ending location in order to find where the match actually starts, and then once more \nwalk forwards from that known starting position to find the actual ending posit ion. However, with \ndotnet/runtime#68199  from [@olsaarik](https://github.com/olsaarik), unless captures are required, it \ncan now be done in only two passes: once forward to find the guaranteed ending location of the \nmatch, and then once in rever', 'se to find its starting location. And dotnet/runtime#65129  from \n[@olsaarik](https://github.com/olsaarik) added captures support, which the o riginal implementation \nalso didn’t have. This captures support adds back a third pass, such that once the bounds of the \nmatch are known, the engine runs the forward pass one more time, but this time with an NFA -based \n“simulation” that is able to record “ca pture effects” on transitions. All of this ena', 'bles the non -\nbacktracking implementation to have the exact same semantics as the backtracking engines, always \nproducing the same matches in the same order with the same capture information. The only \ndifference in this regard is, whereas with the backtracking engines capture groups inside of loops will \nstore all values captured in every iteration of the loop, only the last iteration is stored with the non -\nbacktracking implementation. On top', ' of that, there are a f ew constructs the non -backtracking  \n132 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n implementation simply doesn’t support, such that attempting to use any of those will fail when trying \nto construct the Regex , e.g. backreferences and lookarounds.  \nEven after its progress as a standalone library from MSR, more than 100 PRs went into making \nRegexOptions.NonBacktracking  what it is now in .NET 7, including optimizations like \ndotnet/runtime#', '70217  from [@olsaarik](https://github.com/olsaarik) that t ries to streamline the tight \ninner matching loop at the heart of the DFA (e.g.  read the next input character, find the appropriate \ntransition to take, move to the next node, and check information about the node like whether it’s a \nfinal state) and optimiza tions like dotnet/runtime#65637  from [@veanes](https://github.com/veanes) \nthat optimized the NFA mode to avoid superfluous allo', 'cations, caching and reusing list and set \nobjects to make the han dling of the lists of states ammortized allocation -free. \nThere’s one more set of PRs of performance interest for NonBacktracking . The Regex  implementation \nfor taking patterns and turning them into something processable, regardless of which of the multiple \nengines is being used, is essentially a compiler, and as with many compilers, it naturally lends itself to \nrecursive alg', 'orithms. In the case of Regex , those algorithms involve walking around trees of regular \nexpression constructs. Recursion ends up being a  very handy way of expressing these algorithms, but \nrecursion also suffers from the possibility of stack overflow; essentially it’s using stack space as scratch \nspace, and if it ends up using too much, things go badly. One common approach to dealing with t his \nis turning the recursive algorithm into an iter', 'ative one, which typically involves using an explicit stack \nof state rather than the implicit one. The nice thing about this is the amount of state you can store is \nlimited only by how much memory you have , as opposed to being limited by your thread’s stack \nspace. The downsides, however, are that it’s typically much less natural to write the algorithms in this \nmanner, and it typically requires allocating heap space for the stack, which then ', 'leads to additio nal \ncomplications if you want to avoid that allocation, such as various kinds of pooling. \ndotnet/runtime#60385  introduces a different approach for Regex , which is then used by \ndotnet/runtime#60786  from [@olsaarik](https://github.com/olsaarik) specifically in the \nNonBacktracking  implementation. It still uses recursion, and thus benefits from the expressiveness of \nthe recursive algor ithm as well as being able to use stack', ' space and thus avoid additional allocation in \nthe most common cases, but then to avoid stack overflows, it issues explicit checks to ensure we’re \nnot too deep on the stack (.NET has long provided the helpers \nRuntimeH elpers.EnsureSufficientExecutionStack  and \nRuntimeHelpers.TryEnsureSufficientExecutionStack  for this purpose). If it detects it’s too deep \non the stack, it forks off continued execution into another thread. Hitting this condit', 'ion is expensive, \nbut it’s very  rarely if ever actually hit in practice (e.g.  the only time it’s hit in our vast functional tests \nare in the tests explicitly written to stress it), it keeps the code simple, and it keeps the typical cases \nfast. A similar approach is used in other areas o f dotnet/runtime , such as in System.Linq.Expressions.  \nAs was mentioned in my previous blog post about regular expressions, both the backtracking \nimplemen', 'tations and the non -backtracking implementation have their place. The main benefit of the \nnon-backtracking implementation is predictability: because of the linear processing guarantee, once \nyou’ve constructed the regex, you don’t need to worry about malicious inputs causing worst -case \nbehavior in the processing of your potentially susceptible expressions. This doesn’t mean \nRegexOptions.NonBacktracking  is always the fastest; in fact, it’s f', 'requently not. In exchange for \nreduced best -case performance, it provides the best worst -case performa nce, and for some kinds of \napplications, that’s a really worthwhile and valuable tradeoff.   \n133 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n New APIs  \nRegex  gets several new methods in .NET 7, all of which enable improved performance. The simplicity \nof the new APIs likely also misrepresents how much work w as necessary to enable them, in particular \nbecause t', 'he new APIs all support ReadOnlySpan<char>  inputs into the regex engines.  \ndotnet/runtime#65473  brings Regex  into the span -based era of .NET,  overcoming a significant \nlimitation in Regex  since spans were introduced back in .NET Core 2.1. Regex  has historically been \nbased on processing System.String  inputs, and that fact pervades the Regex  design and \nimplementation, including the APIs exposed fo r the extensibility model Regex.Compile', 'ToAssembly  \nrelied on in .NET Framework ( CompileToAssembly  is now obsoleted and has never been functional in \n.NET Core). One subtly that relies on the nature of string  as the input is how match information is \nreturned to callers. Regex.Match  returns a Match  object that represents the first match in the input, \nand that Match  object exposes a NextMatch  method that enables moving to the next match. That \nmeans the Match  object needs to s', 'tore a reference to the input, so tha t it can be fed back into the \nmatching engine as part of such a NextMatch  call. If that input is a string , great, no problem. But if \nthat input is a ReadOnlySpan<char> , that span as a ref struct  can’t be stored on the class Match  \nobject, since ref structs  can only live on the stack and not the heap. That alone would make it a \nchallenge to support spans, but the problem is even more deeply rooted. Al', 'l of the regex engines rely \non a RegexRunner , a base class that stores on it all of the state necessary to fee d into the \nFindFirstChar  and Go methods that compose the actual matching logic for the regular expressions \n(these methods contain all of the core code for performing the match, with FindFirstChar  being an \noptimization to skip past input positions that coul dn’t possibly start a match and then Go performing \nthe actual matching log', 'ic). If you look at the internal RegexInterpreter  type, which is the engine you \nget when you construct a new Regex(...)  without the RegexOptions.Compiled  or \nRegexOptions.NonBacktrack ing flags, it derives from RegexRunner . Similarly, when you use \nRegexOptions.Compiled , it hands off the dynamic methods it reflection emits to a type derived from \nRegexRunner , RegexOptions.NonBacktracking  has a SymbolicRegexRunnerFactory  that produces \nty', 'pes derived from RegexRunner , and so on. Most relevant here, RegexRunner  is public, because the \ntypes generated by the Regex.CompileToAssembly  type (and now the regex source generator) include \nones derived from this RegexRunner . Those FindFirstChar  and Go methods are thus abstract  and \nprotected , and parameterless, because they pick up all the state they need from protected members \non the base class. That includes the string  input to p', 'rocess. So what about spans? We could of \ncourse have just called ToString()  on an input ReadOnlySpan<char> . That would have been \nfunctionally correct, but would have completely defeated the purpose of accepting spans, and worse, \nwould have been so unexpected as to likely cause consuming apps to be worse perf orming than they \nwould have without the APIs. Instead, we needed a new approach and new APIs.  \nFirst, we made FindFirstChar  and Go v', 'irtual instead of abstract. The design that splits these methods \nis largely antiquated, and in particular the forced separati on between a stage of processing where you \nfind the next possible location of a match and then a stage where you actually perform the match at \nthat location doesn’t align well with all engines, like the one used by NonBacktracking  (which initially \nimplemen ted FindFirstChar  as a nop and had all its logic in Go). Then', ' we added a new virtual Scan  \nmethod which, importantly, takes a ReadOnlySpan<char>  as a parameter; the span can’t be exposed \nfrom the base RegexRunner  and must be passed in. We then implemented FindFirstChar  and Go in \nterms of Scan , and made them “just work.” Then, all of the engines are implemented in terms of that  \n134 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n span; they no longer need to access the protected RegexRunner.runtext , RegexRunner.runtextbeg ,', ' \nand RegexRunner.runtextend  members tha t surface the input; they’re just handed the span, already \nsliced to the input region, and process that. One of the neat things about this from a performance \nperspective is it enables the JIT to do a better job at shaving off various overheads, in particul ar \naround bounds checking. When the logic is implemented in terms of string , in addition to the input \nstring itself the engine is also handed the ', 'beginning and end of the region of the input to process \n(since the developer could have called a method like Regex.Match(string input, int beginning, \nint length)  in order to only process a substring). Obviously the engine matching logic is way more \ncomplicated than this, but simplifying, imagine the entirety of the engine was just a loop over the \ninput. With the i nput, beginning, and length, that would look like:  \n[Benchmark]  \n[Arguments ', '("abc", 0, 3)] \npublic void Scan(string input, int beginning, int length) \n{ \n    for (int i = beginning; i < length; i++)  \n    { \n        Check(input[i]);  \n    } \n} \n \n[MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions. AggressiveInlining )] \nprivate void Check(char c) { } \nThat will result in the JIT generating assembly code along the lines of this:  \n; Program.Scan(System.String, Int32, Int32)  \n       sub       rsp,28  \n       cmp       r8d,r9d  \n       jge   ', '    short M00_L01  \n       mov       eax,[rdx+8]  \nM00_L00:  \n       cmp       r8d,eax  \n       jae       short M00_L02  \n       inc       r8d  \n       cmp       r8d,r9d  \n       jl        short M00_L00  \nM00_L01:  \n       add       rsp,28  \n       ret \nM00_L02:  \n       call      CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL  \n       int       3  \n; Total bytes of code 36  \nIn contrast, if we’re dealing with a span, which already factors in the bounds, then we can wr', 'ite a more \ncanonical loop like this:  \n[Benchmark]  \n[Arguments ("abc")] \npublic void Scan(ReadOnl ySpan<char> input)  \n{ \n    for (int i = 0; i < input. Length; i++) \n    { \n        Check(input[i]);  \n    } \n}  \n135 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n  \n[MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions. AggressiveInlining )] \nprivate void Check(char c) { } \nAnd when it comes to compilers, something in a canonical form is really good, because the more \ncommon the shape of the c', 'ode, the more likely it is to be heavily optimized:  \n; Program.Scan(System.ReadOnlySpan`1<Char>)  \n       mov       rax,[rdx]  \n       mov       edx,[rdx+8]  \n       xor       ecx,ecx  \n       test      edx,edx  \n       jle       short M00_L01  \nM00_L00:  \n       mov       r8d,ecx  \n       movsx     r8,word ptr [rax+r8*2]  \n       inc       ecx  \n       cmp       ecx,edx  \n       jl        short M00_L00  \nM00_L01:  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of ', 'code 27  \nSo even without all the othe r benefits that come from operating in terms of span, we immediately get \nlow-level code generation benefits from performing all the logic in terms of spans. While the above \nexample was made up (obviously the matching logic does more than a simple for loop) , here’s a real \nexample. When a regex contains a \\b, as part of evaluating the input against that \\b the backtracking \nengines call a RegexRunner.IsBou', 'ndary  helper method which checks whether the character at the \ncurrent position is a word character and whe ther the character before it is a word character (factoring \nin the bounds of the input as well). Here’s what the IsBoundary  method based on string  looked like \n(the runtext  it’s using is the name of the string  field on RegexRunner  that stores the input):  \n[Benchmark]  \n[Arguments (0, 0, 26)] \npublic bool IsBoundary (int index, int s', 'tartpos, int endpos) \n{ \n    return (index > startpos && IsBoundaryWordChar (runtext[index - 1])) != \n           (index < endpos   && IsBoundaryWordChar (runtext[index]));  \n} \n \n[MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions. NoInlining )] \nprivate bool IsBoundaryWordChar (char c) => false; \nand here’s what the span version looks like:  \n[Benchmark]  \n[Arguments ("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" , 0)] \npublic bool IsBoundary (ReadOnlySpan< char> inputSpan, int inde', 'x) \n{ \n    int indexM1 = index - 1; \n    return ((uint)indexM1 < ( uint)inputSpan.

But in the \nsecond, the JIT can know and trust that the ReadOnlySpan<char> ’s lower bound is 0 and upper bound \n(exclusive) is the span’s Length , and with how the method is constructed, it can then pr', 'ove that the \nspan accesses are always in bound. As such, it doesn’t need to emit any bounds checks in the method, \nand the method then lacks the tell -tale signature of the index out of range throw. You can see more \nexamples of taking advantage of spans now being at the heart of the all of the engines in  \n138 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n dotnet/runtime#66129 , dotnet/runtime#66178 , and dotnet/runtime#72728 , all of which clean up \nunnecessary checks', ' against the bounds that are then always 0 and span.Length . \nOk, so the engine s are now able to be handed span inputs and process them, great, what can we do \nwith that? Well, Regex.IsMatch  is easy: it’s not encumbered by needing to perform multiple matches, \nand thus doesn’t need to worry about how to store that input ReadOnlySpan<ch ar> for the next \nmatch. Similarly, the new Regex.Count , which provides an optimized implementation for count', 'ing \nhow many matches there are in the input, can bypass using Match  or MatchCollection , and thus can \neasily operate over spans as well; dotnet/runtime#64289  added string -based overloads, and \ndotnet/runtime#66026  added span -based overloads. We can optimize Count  further by pas sing \nadditional information into the engines to let them know how much information they actually need to \ncompute. For example, I noted previously that NonBacktra', 'cking  is fairly pay -for-play in how much \nwork it needs to do relative to what information it ne eds to gather. It’s cheapest to just determine \nwhether there is a match, as it can do that in a single forward pass through the input. If it also needs \nto compute the actual starting and ending bounds, that requires another reverse pass through some \nof the  input. And if it then also needs to compute capture information, that requires yet another', ' \nforward pass based on an NFA (even if the other two were DFA -based). Count  needs the bounds \ninformation, as it needs to know where to start looking for the next mat ch, but it doesn’t need the \ncapture information, since none of that capture information is handed back to the caller. \ndotnet/runtime#68242  updates the engines to receive this additional inform ation, such that methods \nlike Count  can be made more efficient.  \nSo, IsMatch  and', ' Count  can work with spans. But we still don’t have a method that lets you actually get \nback that match information. Enter the new EnumerateMatches  method, added by \ndotnet/runtime#67794 . EnumerateMatches  is very similar to Match , except instead of handing back a \nMatch  class instance, it hands back a ref struct  enumerator:  \npublic ref struct ValueMatchEnumerator  \n{ \n    private readonly  Regex _regex;  \n    private readonly  ReadOnlySp', 'an< char> _input;  \n    private ValueMatch _current;  \n    private int _startAt;  \n    private int _prevLen;  \n    ... \n} \nBeing a ref struct , the enumerator is able to store a reference to the input span, and is thus able to \niterate through matches, which are represented by the ValueMatch  ref struct. Notably, today \nValueMatch  doesn’t provide capture information, which also enables it to partake in the optimizations \npreviously me ntioned fo', 'r Count . Even if you have an input string , EnumerateMatches  is thus a way to \nhave ammortized allocation -free enumeration of all matches in the input. In .NET 7, though, there isn’t \na way to have such allocation -free enumeration if you also need a ll the capture data. That’s something \nwe’ll investigate designing in the future if/as needed.  \nTryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition  \nAs noted earlier, the core of all of the engines is a Scan(Re', 'adOnlySpan<char>)  method that accepts \nthe input text to match, co mbines that with positional information from the base instance, and exits  \n139 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n when it either finds the location of the next match or exhausts the input without finding another. For \nthe backtracking engines, the implementation of that method is logically as fol lows:  \nprotected  override  void Scan(ReadOnlySpan< char> inputSpan)  \n{ \n    while (!TryMatchA', 'tCurrentPosition (inputSpan) &&  \n           base.runtextpos  != inputSpan. Length) \n    { \n        base.runtextpos ++; \n    } \n} \nWe try to match the input at the current position, and if we’re successful in doing so, that’s it, we exit. \nIf the current position doesn’t match, however, then if there’s any input remaining we “bump” the \nposition and start the process over. In regex engine terminology, this is often referred to  as a \n“bumpalong l', 'oop.” However, if we actually ran the full matching process at every input character, that \ncould be unnecessarily slow. For many patterns, there’s something about the pattern that would \nenable us to be more thoughtful about where we perfo rm full matches, quickly skipping past locations \nthat couldn’t possibly match, and only spending our time and resources on locations that have a real \nchance of matching. To elevate that concept to a first -c', 'lass one, the backtracking engines’ \n“bumpalong loo p” is typically more like the following (I say “typically” because in some cases the \ncompiled and source generated regexes are able to generate something even better).  \nprotected  override  void Scan(ReadOnlySpan< char> inputSpan)  \n{ \n    while (TryFindNextPossi bleStartingPosition (inputSpan) &&  \n           !TryMatchAtCurrentPosition (inputSpan) &&  \n           base.runtextpos  != inputSpan', '. Length) \n    { \n        base.runtextpos ++; \n    } \n} \nAs with FindFirstChar  previously, that TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition  has th e \nresponsibility of searching as quickly as possible for the next place to match (or determining that \nnothing else could possibly match, in which case it would return false  and the loop would exit). As \nFindFirstChar , and it was embued with multiple ways of  doing its job. In .NET 7, \nTryFindNextPossible', 'StartingPosition  learns many more and improved ways of helping the engine \nbe fast.  \nIn .NET 6, the interpreter engine had effectively two ways of implementing \nTryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition : a Boyer -Moore s ubstring search if the pattern began with a \nstring (potentially case -insensitive) of at least two characters, and a linear scan for a character class \nknown to be the set of all possible chars that could begin a match. For the lat', 'ter case, the interpreter \nhad eight different implementations for matching, based on a combination of whether \nRegexOptions.RightToLeft  was set or not, whether the character class required case -insensitive \ncomparison or not, and whether the character class contained only a single cha racter or more than \none character. Some of these were more optimized than others, e.g.  a left -to-right, case -sensitive, \nsingle -char search would use an Ind', 'exOf(char)  to search for the next location, an optimization \nadded in .NET 5. However, every time this  operation was performed, the engine would need to \nrecompute which case it would be. dotnet/runtime#60822  improved this, introducing an internal  \n140 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n enum of the strategies used by TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition  to find the next opportunity, \nadding a switch  to TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition  to quickly jump', ' to the right strategy, \nand precomputing which strategy to use when the interpreter was c onstructed. This not only made \nthe interpreter’s implementation at match time faster, it made it effectively free (in terms of runtime \noverhead at match time) to add additional strategies.  \ndotnet/runtime#60888  then added the first additional strategy. The implementation was already \ncapable of using IndexOf(char) , but as mentioned previously in this p', 'ost, the implementation of \nIndexOf(ReadOnlySpan<char>)  got way better in .NET 7 in many cases, t o the point where it ends up \nbeing significantly better than Boyer -Moore in all but the most corner of corner cases.

This wasn’t done in the previously \nmentioned PR because of lack of a goo', 'd way to handle case -insensitive matches. However, this PR \nalso special -cased ASCII letters to teach the optimizer how to turn an ASCII case -insensi tive match \ninto a set of both casings of that letter (excluding the few known to be a problem, like i and k, which \ncan both be impacted by the employed culture and which might map case -insensitively to more than \ntwo values). With enough of the common cases  covered, rather than use Boyer -Moo', 're to perform a \ncase-insensitive search, the implementation just uses IndexOfAny(char, char, ...)  to search for \nthe starting set, and the vectorization employed by IndexOfAny  ends up outpacing the old \nimplementation handi ly in real -world cases. This PR goes further than that, such that it doesn’t just \ndiscover the “starting set,” but is able to find all of the character classes that could match a pattern a \nfixed -offset from the beginnin', 'g; that then gives the analyzer the a bility to choose the set that’s \nexpected to be least common and issue a search for it instead of whatever happens to be at the \nbeginning. The PR goes even further, too, motivated in large part by the non -backtracking engine. The \nnon-backtracking engine’s p rototype implementation also used IndexOfAny(char, char, ...)  when \nit arrived at a starting state and was thus able to quickly skip through input tex', 't that wouldn’t have a \nchance of pushing it to the next state. We wanted all of the engines to share as muc h logic as \npossible, in particular around this speed ahead, and so this PR unified the interpreter with the non -\nbacktracking engine to have them share the exact same TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition  \nroutine (which the non -backtracking engine just calls at an appropriate place in its graph traversal \nloop). Since the non -backtrack', "ing engine was already using IndexOfAny  in this manner, initially not \ndoing so popped as a significant regression on a variety of patterns we measure, and this caused us to \ninvest  in using it everywhere.

The “auto ", '-atomicity” analysis \ndiscussed in the previous PR is one form of analysis that walks around this tree looking for \nopportunities to  transform portions of the tree into a behaviorally equivalent alternative that will be \nmore efficient to execute. Several PRs introduced additional such transformations. \ndotnet/runtime#63695 , for example, looks for “empty” and “nothing” nodes in the tree that can be \nremoved. An “empty” node is something that ma', 'tches the empty string, so for example in the \nalternation abc|def||ghi , the third branch of that alternation is em pty. A “nothing” node is \nsomething that can’t match anything, so for example in the concatenation abc(?!)def , that (?!)  in \nmiddle is a negative lookahead around an empty, which can’t possibly match anything, as it’s saying \nthe expression won’t match if it’ s followed by an empty string, which everything is. These constructs \no', 'ften arise as a result of other transformations rather than being something a developer typically \nwrites by hand, just as there are optimizations in the JIT where you might look at them and say “why \non earth is that something a developer would write” but it ends up being a valuable optimization \nanyways because inlining might transform perfectly reasonable code into something that matches the \ntarget pattern. Thus, for example, if you did h ave', ' abc(?!)def , since that concatenation requires the \n(?!)  to match in order to be successful, the concatenation itself can simply be replaced by a \n“nothing.” You can see this easily if you try this with the source generator:  \n[GeneratedRegex (@"abc(?!)def" )]  \n146 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n as it will produce a Scan  method like this (comment and all):  \nprotected  override  void Scan(ReadOnlySpan< char> inputSpan)  \n{ \n    // The pattern never ma', 'tches anything.  \n} \nAnother set of transformations was introduced in dotnet/runtime#59903 , specifically around \nalternations (which beyond loops are the other source of backtracking). This introduced two main \noptimizations. First, it enables rewriting alternations into alternations of alternations, e.g.  transforming \naxy|axz|bxy|bxz  into ax(?:y|z)|bx(?:y|z) , which is then further reduced into ax[yz]|bx[yz] . This \ncan enable the backtrackin', 'g engines to more efficiently process alternations due to fewer branches \nand thus less potential back tracking. The PR also enabled limited reordering of branches in an \nalternation. Generally branches can’t be reordered, as the order can impact exactly what’s matched \nand what’s captured, but if the engine can prove there’s no effect on ordering, then it’s free to \nreorder. One key place that ordering isn’t a factor is if the alternation is ato', 'mic due to it being \nwrapped in an atomic group (and the auto -atomicity analysis will add such groups implicitly in some \nsituations). Reordering the branches then enable s other optimizations, like the one previously \nmentioned from this PR. And then once those optimizations have kicked in, if we’re left with an atomic \nalternation where every branch begins with a different letter, than can enable further optimizations in \nterms of how the alte', 'rnation is lowered; this PR teaches the source generator how to emit a switch  \nstatement, which leads to both more efficient and more readable code. (The detection of whether \nnodes in the tree are atomic, and other such properties such as  performing captures or introducing \nbacktracking, turned out to be valuable enough that dotnet/runtime#65734  added dedicated support \nfor this.)  \nCode generation  \nThe .NET 7 regex implementation has no few', 'er than four engines: the interpreter (what you get if you \ndon’t explicitly choose another engine), the compiler (what you get with RegexOptions.Compiled ), \nthe non -backtracking engine (what you get with RegexOptions.NonBacktracking ), and the sour ce \ngenerator (what you get with [GeneratedRegex(...)] ). The interpreter and the non -backtracking \nengine don’t require any kind of code generation; they’re both based on creating in -memory data ', '\nstructures that represent how to match input against the patter n. The other two, though, both \ngenerate code specific to the pattern; the generated code is code attempting to mimick what you \nmight write if you weren’t using Regex  at all and were instead writing code to perform a similar match \ndirectly. The source gener ator spits out C# that’s compiled directly into your assembly, and the \ncompiler spits out IL at run -time via reflection em', 'it. The fact that these are generating code specific to \nthe pattern means there’s a ton of opportunity to optimize.  \ndotnet/runtime#59186  provided the initial implementation of the source generator. This was a direct \nport of the compiler, effectively a line -by-line translation of IL into C#; the result is C# a kin to what \nyou’d get if you were to run the generated IL through a decompiler like ILSpy . A bunch of PRs then \nproceeded to iterat', 'e on and tweak the source generator, but the biggest improvements came  from \nchanges that changed the compiler and the source generator together. Prior to .NET 5, the compiler \nspit out IL that was very similar to what the interpreter would do. The interpreter is handed a series of \ninstructions that it walks through one by one  and interprets, and the compiler, handed that same  \n147 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n series of instructions, would just emit', ' the IL for processing each. It had some opportunity for being \nmore efficient, e.g.  loop unrolling, but a lot of value was left on the table. In .NET 5, an alternate  path \nwas added in support of patterns without backtracking; this code path was based on being handed \nthe parsed node tree rather than being based on the series of instructions, and that higher -level form \nenabled the compiler to derive more insights about the pattern that it co', 'uld then use to generate \nmore efficient code. In .NET 7, support for all regex features were incrementally added in, over the \ncourse of multiple PRs, in particular dotnet /runtime#60385  for backtracking single char loops, \ndotnet/runtime#61698  for backtracking single char lazy loops, dotnet/runtime# 61784  for other \nbacktracking lazy loops, and dotnet/runtime#61906  for other backtracking loops as well as back \nreferences and conditionals. A', 't that point, the only features missing were suppor t for \nRegexOptions.RightToLeft  and lookbehinds (which are implemented in terms of right -to-left), and \nwe decided based on relatively little use of these features that we needn’t keep around the old \ncompiler code just to enable them. So, dotnet/runtime#62318  deleted the old implementation. But, \neven though these features are relatively rare, it’s a lot easier to tell a story that “all patt', 'erns are \nsupported” than one that requires special callou ts and exceptions, so dotnet/runtime#66127  and \ndotnet/runtime#66280  added full lookbehind and RightToLeft  support such that ther e were no \ntakebacks. At this point, both the compiler and source generator now supported everything the \ncompiler previously did, but now with the more modernized code generation. This code generation is \nin turn what enables many of the optimizations previ', 'o usly discussed, e.g.  it provides the opportunity \nto use APIs like LastIndexOf  as part of backtracking, which would have been near impossible with the \nprevious approach.  \nOne of the great things about the source generator emitting idiomatic C# is it makes it  easy to iterate. \nEvery time you put in a pattern and see what the generator emits, it’s like being asked to do a code \nreview of someone else’s code, and you very frequently see somet', 'hing “new” worthy of comment, or \nin this case, improving the generator to  address the issue. And so a bunch of PRs were originated \nbased on reviewing what the generator emitted and then tweaking the generator to do better (and \nsince the compiler was effectively entirely rewritten along with the source generator, they maintain t he \nsame structure, and it’s easy to port improvements from one to the other). For example, \ndotnet/runtime#68846  a', 'nd dotnet/runti me#69198  tweaked how some comparisons were being \nperformed in order for them to convey enough information to the JIT that it can eliminate some \nsubsequent bounds checking, and dotnet/runtime#6 8490  recognized a variety of conditions being \nemitted that could never happen in some situations observable statically and was able to elide all that \ncode gen. It also became obvious that some patterns didn’t need the full expressivity', ' of the scan loop, \nand a more compact and customized Scan  implementation could be used. dotnet/runtime#68560  \ndoes that, such that, for example, a simple pattern like hello  won’t emit a loop at all and will instead  \nhave a simpler Scan  implementation like:  \nprotected  override  void Scan(ReadOnlySpan< char> inputSpan)  \n{ \n    if (TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition (inputSpan))  \n    { \n        // The search in TryFindNextPossibleStarting', 'Position performed the entire match.  \n        int start = base.runtextpos ; \n        int end = base.runtextpos  = start + 5; \n        base.Capture(0, start, end);  \n    } \n}  \n148 CHAPTER 11 | Regex  \n The compiler and source generator were also updated to take adv antage of newer features. \ndotnet/runtime#63277 , for example, teaches the source generator how to determine if unsafe  code is \nallowed, and if it is, it emits a [SkipLocalsInit]  fo', 'r the core log ic; the matching routine can result in \nmany locals being emitted, and SkipLocalsInit  can make it cheaper to call the function due to less \nzero’ing being necessary. Then there’s the issue of where the code is generated; we want helper \nfunctions (like the \\w IsWordChar  helper introduced in dotnet/runtime#62620 ) that can be shared \namongst multiple generated regexes, and we want to be able to share the exact same regex \nimplemen', 'tation if the same pa ttern/options/timeout combination are used in multiple places in the \nsame assembly ( dotnet/runtime#66747 ), but doing so then exposes this implementation detail to user \ncode in the same assembl y. To still be able to get the perf benefits of such code sharing while \navoiding the resulting complications, dotnet/runtime#66432  and then dotnet/runtime#71765  teaches \nthe source generator to use the new file-local types  feat', 'ures in C# 11 ( dotnet/roslyn#62375 ). \nOne last  and interesting code generation aspect is in optimizations around character class matching. \nMatching character classes, whether ones explicitly written by the developer or ones implicitly created \nby the engine (e.g.  as part of finding the set of all chara cters that can begin the expression), can be \none of the more time -consuming aspects of matching; if you imagine having to evaluate this log', 'ic for \nevery character in the input, then how many instructions needs to be executed as part of matching a \ncharacter class directly correlates to how long it takes to perform the overall match. We thus spend \nsome time trying to ensure we generate optimal matching code for as many categories of character \nclasses as possible. dotnet/runtime#67365 , for example, improved a bunch of cases found to be \ncommon in real -world use, like specially -re', 'cognizing sets like [\\d\\D], [\\s\\S], and [\\w\\W] as meaning \n“match anything” (just as is the case for . in RegexOptions.Singl eline  mode), in which case existing \noptimizations around the handling of “match anything” can kick in.  \nprivate static readonly  string s_haystack = new string(\'a\', 1_000_000); \nprivate Regex _regex = new Regex(@"([\\s\\S]*)", RegexOptions.

The PR also entirely removed at least one  regex usage that was just \nas doable as a cheaper IndexOf . dotnet/runtime#68766  also removed a use of \nRegexOptions.CultureInvariant .

LINQ is a productivity feature that practically \nevery .NET developer uses.

But sometimes \nperformance improvements come about from new APIs that can be used in place of previous ones in \ncertain situations to further improve performance. One such example of that comes from ne', 'w APIs \nintroduced in dotnet/runtime#70525  from [@deeprobin](https://github.com/deeprobin) which were \nthen improved in dotnet/runtime#71564 . One of the most popular methods in LINQ is \nEnumerable.OrderBy  (and its inverse OrderByDescending ), which enables creating a sorted copy of \nthe input enumerable. To do so, the caller passes a Func<TSource,TKey>  predicate to OrderBy  which \nOrderBy  uses to extract the co mparison key for each item. Ho', 'wever, it’s relatively common to want to \nsort items with themselves as the keys; this is, after all, the default for methods like Array.Sort , and in \nsuch cases callers of OrderBy  end up passing in an identity function, e.g. OrderBy(x => x) . To \neliminate that cruft, .NET 7 introduces the new Order  and OrderDescending  methods, which, in the \nspirit of pairs like Distinct  and DistinctBy , perform that same sorting operation, just with an im', 'plicit \nx => x  done on behalf of the caller.  But beyond performance, a nice benefit of this is the \nimplementation then knows that the keys will all be the same as the inputs, and it no longer needs to \ninvoke the callback for each item to retrieve its key nor allocate a new array to store those keys.  Thus \nif you find yourself using LINQ and reaching for OrderBy(x => x) , consider instead using Order()  \nand reaping the (primarily allocation)', ' benefits:  \n[Params(1024)] \npublic int Length { get; set; } \n \nprivate int[] _arr;  \n \n[GlobalSetup]  \npublic void Setup() => _arr = Enumerable.

While \n.NET 7 doesn’t have any single changes on that scale, it does have a significant number of \nimprovements that measurably “move the needle,” and in variety of ways.  \nOne form of performance imp', 'rovement that also masquerades as a reliability improvement is \nincreasing responsiveness to cancellation requests. The faster something can be canceled, the sooner \nthe system is able to give back valuable resourc es in use, and the sooner things waiting for that \noperation to complete are able to be unblocked. There have been several improvements of this ilk in \n.NET 7.  \nIn some cases, it comes from adding cancelable overloads where things wer', 'en’t previously cancelabl e \nat all. That’s the case for dotnet/runtime#61898  from [@bgrainger](https://github.com/bgrainger), \nwhich added new cancelable overloads of TextReader.ReadLineAsync  and \nTextReader.ReadToEndAsy nc, and that includes overrides of these methods on StreamReader  and \nStringReader ; dotnet/runtime#64301  from [@bgrainger](https://github.com/bgrainger) then \noverrode these methods (and others missing overrides) on the Nul', 'lStreamReader  type returned from \nTextReader.Null  and StreamReader.Null  (interestingly, these were defined as two different types, \nunnecessarily, and so this PR also unified on just having both use the StreamReader  variant, as i t \nsatisfies the required types of both). You can see this put to good use in dotnet/runtime#66492  from \n[@lateapexearlyspeed](https://github.com/lateapexearlyspeed), which adds a new \nFile.ReadLinesAsync  method. T', 'his produces an IAsyncEnumerable<string>  of the lines in the file, \nis based on a simple loop around the new StreamReader.ReadLineAsync  overloa d, and is thus itself \nfully cancelable.  \nFrom my perspective, though, a more interesting form of this is when an existing overload is \npurportedly cancelable but isn’t actually. For example, the base Stream.ReadAsync  method just wraps \nthe Stream.BeginRead /EndRead  methods, which aren’t cancelable, ', 'so if a Stream -derived type doesn’t \noverride ReadAsync , attempts to cancel a call to its ReadAsync  will be minimally effective. It does an \nup-front check for cancellation, such that if cancellation was requested prio r to the call being made, it \nwill be immediately canceled, but after that check the supplied CancellationToken  is effectively \nignored. Over time we’ve tried to stamp out all remaining such cases, but a few stragglers have \nre', 'mained. One pernicious case has been with pipes. For this discussion, there are two relevant kinds of \npipes, anonymous and named, which are represented in .NET as pairs of streams: \nAnonymousPipeClientStream /AnonymousPipeServerStream  and \nNamedPipeClientStream /NamedPipeServerStream . Also, on Windows, the OS makes a distinction \nbetween handles opened for synchronous I/O from handles opened for overlapped I/O (aka \nasynchronous I/O), and this', ' is reflected in the .NET API: you can open a named pipe for synchronous \nor overlapped I/O based on the  PipeOptions.Asynchronous  option specified at construction. And, on  \n160 CHAPTER 14 | File I/O  \n Unix, named pipes, contrary to their naming, are actually implemented on top of Unix domain sockets. \nNow some history:  \n• .NET Framework 4.8: No cancellation support. The pipe Stream -derived types didn’t even \noverride ReadAsync  or WriteAsyn', 'c , so all they got was the default up -front check for \ncancellation and then the token was ignored.  \n• .NET Core 1.0: On Windows, with a named pipe opened for asynchronous I/O, cancellation was \nfully supported. The implementation would register with the CancellationToken , and upon a \ncancellation request, would use CancelIoEx  for the NativeOverlapped*  associated with the \nasynchronous operation. On Unix, with named pipes implemented in ter', 'ms of sockets, if the pipe  \nwas opened with PipeOptions.Asynchronous , the implementation would simulate cancellation \nvia polling: rather than simply issuing the Socket.ReceiveAsync /Socket.SendAsync  (which \nwasn’t cancelable at the time), it would queue a work item to the ThreadPool , and that work \nitem would run a polling loop, making Socket.Poll  calls with a small timeout, checking the \ntoken, and then looping around to do it again until ', 'either the Poll  indicated the operation \nwould succeed or cancellation was requested. On both Window s and Unix, other than a named \npipe opened with Asynchronous , after the operation was initated, cancellation was a nop.  \n• .NET Core 2.1: On Unix, the implementation was improved to avoid the polling loop, but it still \nlacked a truly cancelable Socket.Receive Async /Socket.SendAsync . Instead, by this point \nSocket.ReceiveAsync  supported zer', 'o -byte reads, where a caller could pass a zero -length buffer \nto ReceiveAsync  and use that as notification for data being available to consume without \nactually consuming it. The  Unix implementation for asynchronous named pipe streams then \nchanged to issue zero -byte reads, and would await  a Task.WhenAny  of both that operation’s \ntask and a task that would be completed when cancellation was requested. Better, but still far \nfrom idea l. \n•', ' .NET Core 3.0: On Unix, Socket  got truly cancelable ReceiveAsync  and SendAsync  methods, \nwhich asynchronous named pipes were updated to utilize. At this point, the Windows and Unix \nimplementations were effectively on par with regards to cancellation; bot h good for \nasynchronous named pipes, and just posing for everything else.  \n• .NET 5: On Unix, SafeSocketHandle  was exposed and it became possible to create a Socket  for \nan arbitrary sup', 'plied SafeSocketHandle , which enabled creating a Socket  that actually referred \nto an anonymous pipe. This in tern enabled every PipeStream  on Unix to be implemented in \nterms of Socket , which enabled ReceiveAsync /SendAsync  to be fully cancelable for both \nanonymous and named pipe s, regardless of how they were opened.  \nSo by .NET 5, the problem was addressed on Unix, but still an issue on Windows. Until now. In .NET 7, \nwe’ve made the res', 't of the operations fully cancelable on Windows as well, thanks to \ndotnet/runtime#72503  (and a subsequent tweak in dotnet/runtime#72612 ). Windows doesn’t support \noverlapped I/O for anonymous pipes today, so for anonymous pipe s and for named pipes opened for \nsynchronous I/O, the Windows implementation would just delegate to the base Stream  \nimplementation, which would queue a work item to the ThreadPool  to invoke the synchronous \ncounterpa', 'rt, just on another thread. Instead, the implementations now queue that work item, but \ninstead of just calling the synchronous method, it does some pre - and post - work that registers for \ncancellation, passing in the thread ID of the thread that’s about to perform the I/O. If cancellation is \nreque sted, the implementation then uses CancelSynchronousIo  to interrupt it. There’s a race \ncondition here, in that the moment the thread registers fo', 'r cancellation, cancellation could be \nrequested, such that CancelSynchronousIo  could be called before the opera tion is actually initiated.  \n161 CHAPTER 14 | File I/O  \n So, there’s a small spin loop employed, where if cancellation is requested between the time \nregistration occurs and the time the synchronous I/O is actually performed, the cancellation thread \nwill spin until the I/O is initiated , but this condition is expected to be exceedi', 'ngly rare. There’s also a \nrace condition on the other side, that of CancelSynchronousIo  being requested after the I/O has \nalready completed; to address that race, the implementation relies on the guarantees mad e by \nCancellationTokenRegistration.Dispose , which promises that the associated callback will either \nnever be invoked or will already have fully completed executing by the time Dispose  returns. Not only \ndoes this implementation comp', 'lete the puzzle such that  all asynchronous read/write operations on \nboth anonymous and named pipes on both Windows and Unix are cancelable, it also actually \nimproves normal throughput.  \nprivate Stream _server;  \nprivate Stream _client;  \nprivate byte[] _buffer = new byte[1]; \nprivate CancellationTokenSource _cts = new CancellationTokenSource (); \n \n[Params(false, true)] \npublic bool Cancelable { get; set; } \n \n[Params(false, true)] \npublic bo', 'ol Named { get; set; } \n \n[GlobalSetup]  \npublic void Setup() \n{ \n    if (Named) \n    { \n        string name = Guid.

The code had been performing a stat  call in order to determine up front wheth', 'er the \nsource was actually a directory, in which case the operation would error out. Instead, the PR simply \ntries to open the source file, which it would need to do an yway for the copy operation, and then it \nonly performs that stat  if opening the file fails. If opening the file succeeds, the code was already \nperforming an fstat  to gather data on the file, such as whether it was seekable; with this change, it \nnow also ex tracts from the re', 'sults of that single fstat  the source file size, which it then threads \nthrough to the core copy routine, which itself is then able to avoid an fstat  syscall it had been \nperforming in order to get the size. Saving those syscalls is great, in particular for very small files \nwhere the overhead of setting up the copy can actually be more expensive than the actual copy of the \nbytes. But the biggest benefit of this PR is that it takes advantage o', 'f IOCTL-FICLONERANGE  on Linux. \nSome Linux file sys tems, like XFS and Btrfs, support “copy -on-write,” which means that rather than \ncopying all of the data to a new file, the file system simply notes that there are two different files \npointing to the same data, sharing the underlying storage. This makes the  “copy” super fast, since \nnothing actually needs to be copied and instead the file system just needs to update some \nbookkeeping; plus, ', 'less space is consumed on disk, since there’s just a single store of the data. The file \nsystem then only needs to actuall y copy data that’s overwritten in one of the files. This PR uses ioctl  \nand FICLONE  to perform the copy as copy -on-write if the source and destination file system are the \nsame and the file system supports the operation. In a similar vein, dotnet/runtime#64264  from \n[@tmds](https://github.com/tmds) further improves File.C', 'opy /FileInfo.CopyTo  by utilizing \ncopy_file_range  on Linux if it’s supported (and only if it’s a new enough kerne l that it addresses  \n163 CHAPTER 14 | File I/O  \n some issues the function had in previous releases). Unlike a typical read/write loop that reads the data \nfrom the source and then writes it to the destination, copy_file_range  is implemented to stay \nentirely in kernel mode, without havi ng to transition to user space for each re', 'ad and write.  \nAnother example of avoiding syscalls comes for the File.WriteXx  and File.AppendXx  methods when \non Unix. The implementation of these methods opens a FileStream  or a SafeFileHandle  directly, \nand it was specifying FileOptions.SequentialScan . SequentialScan  is primarily relevant for reading \ndata from a file, and hints to OS caching to expect data to be read from the file sequentially rather \nthan randomly. However, these writ', 'e/append methods don’t read, the y only write, and the \nimplementation of FileOptions.SequentialScan  on Unix requires an additional syscall via \nposix_fadvise  (passing in POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL ); thus, we’re paying for a syscall and not \nbenefiting from it. This situation is akin to the famou s Henny Youngman joke: “The patient says, \n‘Doctor, it hurts when I do this’; the doctor says, ‘Then don’t do that!’.” Here, too, the answer is “don’t \ndo', ' that,” and so dotnet/runtime#59247  from  [@tmds](https://github.com/tmds) simply stops passing \nSequentialScan  in places where it won’t help but may hurt.  \nDirectory handling has seen reduced syscalls across the directory lifecycle, especially on Unix. \ndotnet/runtime#58799  from [@tmds](https://github.com/tmds) speeds up directory creation on Unix. \nPreviously, the implementation of directory creation would first check to see if the director', 'y already \nexisted, which involves a syscall. In  the expected minority case where it already existed the code could \nearly exit out. But in the expected more common case where the directory didn’t exist, it would then \nparse the file path to find all of the directories in it, walk up the directory list un til it found one that \ndid exist, and then try to create all of the subdirectories back down through the target one. However, \nthe expected mo', 'st common case is the parent directories already exist and the child directory doesn’t, \nin which case we’re still pa ying for all that parsing when we could have just created the target \ndirectory. This PR addresses that by changing the up -front existence check to instead simply try to \nmkdir  the target directory; if it succeeds, great, we’re done, and if it fails, the err or code from the \nfailure can be used instead of the existence check to', ' know whether mkdir  failed because it had no \nwork to do. dotnet/runtime#61777  then takes this a step further and avoids st ring allocations while \ncreating directories by using stack memory for the paths temporarily needed to pass to mkdir . \ndotnet/runtime#63675  then improves the performance of moving directories, o n both Unix and \nWindows, removing several syscalls. The shared code for Directory.Move  and DirectorInfo.MoveTo  \nwas doing ex', 'plicit directory existence checks for the source and destination locations, but on \nWindows the Win32 API called to perform the move d oes such checks itself, so they’re not needed \npreemptively. On Unix, we can similarly avoid the existence check for the source directory, as the \nrename  function called will similarly simply fail if the source doesn’t exist (with an appropriate error \nthat l et’s us deduce what went wrong so the right exception ', 'can be thrown), and for the destination, \nthe code had been issuing separate existence checks for whether the destination existed as a directory \nor as a file, but a single stat  call suffices for both.  \nprivate string _path1; \nprivate string _path2; \n \n[GlobalSetup]  \npublic void Setup() \n{ \n    _path1 = Path.

When \nMemoryMappedFile.CreateFromFile  was called, one', ' of the first things it would do is call File.Exists  \nto determine w hether the specified file already exists; that’s because later in the method as part of \ndealing with errors and exceptions, the implementation needs to know whether to delete the file that \nmight then exist; the implementation constructs a FileStream , and d oing might will the specified file \ninto existence. However, that only happens for some FileMode  values, which is confi', 'gurable via an \nargument passed by callers of CreateFromFile . The common and default value of FileMode  is \nFileMode.Open , which requires tha t the file exist such that constructing the FileStream  will throw if it \ndoesn’t. That means we only actually need to call File.Exists  if the FileMode  is something other \nthan Open  or CreateNew , which means we can trivially avoid the extra system call in the  majority case. \ndotnet/runtime#63790  als', 'o helps here, in two ways. First, throughout the CreateFromFile  operation, \nthe implementation might access the FileStream ’s Length  multiple times, but e ach call results in a \nsyscall to read the underlying length of the file. We can instead read it once and use that one value for \nall of the various checks performed. Second, .NET 6 introduced the File.OpenHandle  method which \nenables opening a file handle / file descriptor directly into a S', 'afeFileHandle , rather than having to go \nthrough FileStream  to do so. The use of the FileStream  in MemoryMappedFile  is actually quite \nminimal, and so it makes sense to just use the SafeFileHandle  directly rather than also co nstructing \nthe superfluous FileStream  and its supporting state. This helps to reduce allocations.  \nFinally, there’s dotnet/runtime#63794 , which recognizes that a MemoryMappedViewAccessor  or \nMemoryMappedViewStream ', ' opened for read -only access can’t have been written to. Sounds obvious, \nbut the practical implication of this is that closing either needn’t bother flushing, since that view \ncouldn’t have changed any data in the implementation, and flus hing a view can be relatively \nexpensive, especially for larger views. Thus, a simple change to avoid flushing if the view isn’t writable \ncan yield a measurable improvement to MemoryMappedViewAccessor /Memory', 'MappedviewStream ’s \nDispose .  \n165 CHAPTER 14 | File I/O  \n private string _path; \n \n[GlobalSetup]  \npublic void Setup() \n{ \n    _path = Path.

It also makes the same SequentialScan  change as mentio', 'ned earlier. While this case is about \nreading (whereas the previous change saw SequentialScan  being complete overhead with no \nbenefit), ReadAllBytes{Async}  is very frequently used to read small er files where the overhead of the \nadditional syscall can measure up to 10% of the total cost (and for larger files, modern kernels are \npretty good about caching even without a sequentiality hint, so there’s little downside measured \nthere).  \nAnothe', 'r such change is dotnet/runtime#68662 , which improved Path.Join ’s handling of null or \nempty path segments. Path.Join  has overloads that accept string s and overloads that accept \nReadOnlyS pan<char> s, but all of the overloads produce string s. The string -based overloads just \nwrapped each string in a span and delegated to the span -based overloads. However, in the event that \nthe join operation is a nop (e.g.  there are two path segments an', 'd the second is empty so the join \nshould just return the first), the span -based implementation still needs to create a new string (there’s \nno way for the ReadOnlySpan<char> -based overloads to extract a string from the span). As such, the \nstring -based overloads c an do a little bit better in the case of one of them being null or empty; they \ncan do the same thing the Path.Combine  overloads do, which is to have the M argument overload \ndeleg', 'ate to the M -1 argument overload, filtering out a null or empty, and in the ba se case of the \noverload with two arguments, if a segment is null or empty, the other (or empty) can just be returned \ndirectly.  \nBeyond that, there are a multitude of allocation -focused PRs, such as dotnet/runtime#69335  from \n[@pedrobsaila](https://github.com/pedrobsaila) which adds a fast -path based on stack allocation to \nthe internal ReadLink  helper that’s us', 'ed on Unix anywhere we need to follow symlinks, or \ndotnet/runtime#68752  that updates NamedPipeClientStream.ConnectAsync  to remove a delegate \nallocation (by passing state into a Task.Factory.StartNew  call explicitly), or dotnet/runtime#69412  \nwhich adds an optimized Read(Span<byte>)  override to the Stream  returned from \nAssembly.GetManifestResourceStream . \nBut my personal favorite improvement in this area come from dotnet/runtime#69272 , ', 'which adds a \nfew new helpers to Stream : \npublic void ReadExactly (byte[] buffer, int offset, int count); \npublic void ReadExactly (Span<byte> buffer);  \n \npublic ValueTask ReadExactlyAsync (byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken \ncancellationToken = default); \npublic ValueTask ReadExactlyAsync (Memory< byte> buffer, CancellationToken cancellationToken \n= default); \n \npublic int ReadAtLeast (Span<byte> buffer, int minimumBytes, ', 'bool throwOnEndOfStream = \ntrue); \npublic ValueTask< int> ReadAtLeastAsync (Memory< byte> buffer, int minimumBytes, bool \nthrowOnEndOfStream = true, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default); \nIn fairness, these are more about usability than they are about performance, but in this case there’s  a \ntight correlation between the two. It’s very common to write these helpers one’s self (the \naforementioned PR deleted many open -coded loops for t', 'his functionality from across the core \nlibraries) as the functionality is greatly needed, and it’s unfortunat ely easy to get them wrong in ways  \n167 CHAPTER 14 | File I/O  \n that negatively impact performance, such as by using a Stream.ReadAsync  overload that needs to \nallocate a returned Task<int>  or reading fewer bytes than is allowed as part of a read call. These \nimplementations are correct  and efficient.   \n168 CHAPTER 15 | Compression', '  \n CHAPTER  15 \nCompression  \n.NET Core 2.1 added support for the Brotli  compression algorithm, surfacing it in two ways: \nBrotliStream  and the pair of BrotliEncoder /BrotliDecoder  structs that BrotliStream  is itself built \non top of. For the most part, these types just provide wrappers around a native C implementation \nfrom google/brotli , and so while the .NET layer has the opportunity to improve how data is moved \naround, managed allocati', 'on, and so on, the speed and qual ity of the compression itself are largely at \nthe mercy of the C implementation and the intricacies of the Brotli algorithm.  \nAs with many compression algorithms, Brotli provides a knob that allows for a quintessential tradeoff \nto be made between compression  speed (how fast data can be compressed) and compression \nquality/ratio (how small can the compressed output be made). The hand -wavy idea is the more time', ' \nthe algorithm spends looking for opportunity, the more space can be saved. Many algorithms expose \nthis as a numerical dial, in Brotli’s case going from 0 (fastest speed, least compression) to 11 (spend as \nmuch time as is needed to minimize the output size). But while BrotliEncoder  surfaces that same \nrange, BrotliStream ’s surface area is simpler: most use j ust specifies that compression should be \nperformed (e.g. new BrotliStream(destinati', 'on, CompressionMode.Compress) ) and the only knob \navailable is via the CompressionLevel  enum (e.g. new BrotliStream(destination, \nCompressionLevel.Fastest) ), which provides ju st a few options: CompressionLevel.NoCompression , \nCompressionLevel.Fastest , CompressionLevel.Optimal , and CompressionLevel.SmallestSize . \nThis means the BrotliStream  implementation needs to select a default value when no \nCompressionLevel  is specified and needs to', ' map CompressionLevel  to an underlying numerical \nvalue when one is.  \nFor better or worse (and I’m about to argue “much worse”), the native C implementation its elf defines \nthe default to be 11 ( google/brotli#encode.h ), and so that’s what BrotliStream  has ended up using \nwhen no CompressionLevel  is explicitly specified. Further, the CompressionLevel.Optimal  enum \nvalue is poorly named. It’s intended to represent a good default that’s a ba', 'lanced tradeoff between \nspeed and quality; that’s exactly what it means for DeflateStream , GZipStream , and ZLibStream . But \nfor BrotliStream , as the default it similarly got translated to mean the underlying native library’s \ndefault, which is 11. This means that when constructing a BrotliStream  with either \nCompressionMode.Compress  or CompressionLevel. Optimal , rather than getting a nice balanced \ndefault, you’re getting the dial turned ', 'all the way up to 11.  \nIs that so bad? Maybe compression quality is the most important thing? For example, reducing the \nsize of data can make it faster to then transmit it over a wire, and with a slow connection, size then \nmeaningfully translates into end -to-end throughput.  \nThe problem is just how much this extra effort costs. Compression speed and ratio are highly \ndependent on the data being compressed, so take this example  with a small ', 'grain of salt as it’s not \nentirely representative of all use, but it’s good enough for our purposes.

In \nprevious releases, a lot of effort was focused on the lower layers of the networking stack, e.g. .NET 5 \nsaw a significant investment in improving the performance of sockets on Linux. In .NET 7, much of the \neffort is above sockets.  \nThat said, there were some interesting performance improvements in sockets itself for .NET 7. One of \nthe more inte', 'resting is dotnet/runtime#64770 , which revamped how some synchronization is handled \ninside of SocketsAsyncEventArgs . As background, in the ear ly days of networking in .NET Framework, \nasynchrony was enabled via Begin /End methods (the “APM” pattern). This pattern is not only \ncomplicated to use well, it’s relatively inefficient, resulting in allocation for every single operation \nperformed (at a min imum for the IAsyncResult  object that’s re', 'turned from the BeginXx  method). To \nhelp make networking operations more efficient, SocketsAsyncEventArgs  was introduced. \nSocketsAsyncEventArgs  is a reusable class you allocate to hold all of the state associated w ith \nasynchronous operations: allocate one, pass it to various async methods (e.g. ReceiveAsync ), and \nthen completion events are raised on the SocketAsyncEventArgs  instance when the operation \ncompletes. It can be quite efficie', 'nt when used correctly, but it’ s also complicated to use correctly. In \nsubsequent releases, Task -based and ValueTask -based APIs were released; these have the efficiency \nof SocketAsyncEventArgs  and the ease -of-use of async/await , and are the recommended starting \npoint for all Socket -based asynchronous programming today. They have the efficiency of \nSocketAsyncEventArgs  becaus e they’re actually implemented as a thin veneer on top of it ', 'under the \ncovers, and so while most code these days isn’t written to use SocketAsyncEventArgs  directly, it’s still \nvery relevant from a performance perspective.  \nSocketAsyncEventArgs  on Windows is  implemented to use winsock and overlapped I/O. When you \ncall an async method like ValueTask<Socket> Socket.AcceptAsync(CancellationToken) , that grabs \nan internal SocketAsyncEventArgs  and issues an AcceptAsync  on it, which in turn gets a \nNati', 'veOverlapped*  from the ThreadPoolBoundHandle  associated with the socket, and uses it to issue \nthe native AcceptEx  call. When that handle is initially created, we set the \nFILE_SKIP_COMPLETION_PORT_ON_SUCCESS  completion notification mode on the socket; use of this \nwas int roduced in earlier releases of .NET Core, and it enables a significant number of socket \noperations, in particular sends and receives, to complete synchronously, which in t', 'urn saves \nunnecessary trips through the thread pool, unnecessary unwinding of async s tate machines, and so \non. But it also causes a condundrum. There are some operations we want to perform associated with \nasynchronous operation but that have additional overhead, such as registering for the cancellation of \nthose operations, and we don’t wan t to pay the cost of doing them if the operation is going to \ncomplete synchronously. That means we rea', 'lly want to delay performing such registration until after \nwe’ve made the native call and discovered the operation didn’t complete synchronously… but at t hat \npoint we’ve already initiated the operation, so if it doesn’t  complete synchronously, then we’re now in  \n174 CHAPTER 16 | Networking  \n a potential race condition, where our code that’s still setting up the asynchronous operation is racing \nwith it potentially completing in a callback  ', 'on another thread. Fun. SocketAsyncEventArgs  handled \nthis race condition with a spin lock; the theory was that contention would be incredibly rare, as the \nvast majority cases would either be the operation completing synchronously (in which case there’s no  \nother thread involved) or asynchronously with enough of a delay that the small amount of additional \nwork performed by the initiating thread would have long ago completed by the time the \na', 'synchronous operation completed. And for the most part, that was tru e. However, it turns out that \nit’s actually much more common than expected for certain kinds of operations, like Accepts. Accepts \nend up almost always completing asynchronously, but if there’s already a pending connection, \ncompleting asynchronously almost immediately, which then induces this race condition to happen \nmore frequently and results in more contention on the spin ', 'locks. Contention on a spin lock is \nsomething you really want to avoid. And in fact, for a particular benchmark, this spin lock showed up \nas the cause for an almost 300% slowdown in requests -per-second (RPS) for a benchmark that used a \ndedicated connection per request (e.g.  with every response setting “Connection: close”). \ndotnet/runtime#64770  changed the synchronization mechanism to no longer involve a spin lock; \ninstead, it maintains a ', 'simple gate implemented as an Interlocked.CompareExchange . If the initiating \nthread gets to the gate first, from that point on the operation is considered asynchronous and any \nadditional work is handled by the completing callback. Conversely, if the callback gets to the gate first, \nthe initiating thread treats the operation as if it completed synchronously. This not only avoids one of \nthe threa ds spinning while waiting for the other to make', ' forward progress, it also increases the \nnumber of operations that end up being handled as synchronous, which in turn reduces other costs \n(e.g. the code await ing the task returned from this operation doesn’t n eed to hook up a callback and \nexit, and can instead itself continue executing synchronously). The impact of this is difficult to come \nup with a microbenchmark for, but it can have meaningful impact for loaded Windows servers that \nend ', 'up accepting significa nt numbers of connections in steady state.  \nA more -easily quantifiable change around sockets is dotnet/runtime#71090 , which improves the \nperformance of SocketAddress.Equals . A SocketAddress  is the serialized form of an EndPoint , with \na byte[]  containing the sequence of bytes that represent the address. Its Equals  method, used to \ndetermine whether to SocketAddress  instances are the same, looped over that byte[]  ', 'byte-by-byte. \nNot only is such code  gratuitous when there are now helpers available like SequenceEqual  for \ncomparing spans, doing it byte -by-byte is also much less efficient than the vectorized implementation \nin SequenceEqual .

This represents a \nsignificant  portion of the time required to establish a new connection. For a ', 'client that might \ndisconnect from a server and then reconnect later, as is fairly common in distributed applications, TLS \nresumption allows a client and server to essentially pick up where they left off, with the client and/or \nserver storing some amount of information about recent connections and using that information to \nresume. Windows SChannel provides default support for TLS resumption, and thus the Windows \nimplementation of SslStream  (', 'which is built on SChannel) has long had support for TLS resumption. \nBut OpenSSL’s model requires additional code to enable TLS resumption, and such code wasn’t \npresent in the Linux implementation of SslStream . With dotnet/runtime#57079  and \ndotnet/runtime#63030 , .NET 7 adds server -side support for TLS resumption (using the variant that \ndoesn’t  require storing recent connection state  on the server), and with dotnet/runtime#64369 , .NET 7', ' \nadds client -side support (which does require storing additional state).

When a client \nhandshakes with the server', ' and the server shares its certificate, a client that cares about validating it’s \ntalking to exactly who it intended to talk to needs to validate that certificate. In the days of yore, such \nvalidation was done with certificate revocation lists (CRL), where periodically the client would \ndownload a giant list of certificates known to be revoked. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is \na newer protocol and mechanism that enabl es a client t', 'o get real -time information about a certificate; \nwhile the client handshakes with the server and the server sends the client its certificate, the client \nthen connects to an “OCSP responder” and sends it a request to determine whether the certi ficate is \nconsidered good. OCSP has multiple issues of its own, however. In particular, it places a significant \nload on these OCSP responder servers, with every client making a real -time request to it', ' about every \ncertificate encountered, and also potential ly significantly increasing the time it takes the client to \nestablish a connection. OCSP stapling offers a solution to this. Rather than a client issuing a request to  \n178 CHAPTER 16 | Networking  \n the OCSP responder, the server itself contacts the OCSP responder and gets a signed ticke t from the \nOCSP responder stating that the server’s certificate is good and will be for some period ', 'of time. When \na client handshakes with the server, the server can then “staple” (include) this signed ticket as part of \nits response to the client, giving t he validation to the client directly rather than the client needing to \nmake a separate roundtrip to the OCSP responder. This reduces overheads for everyone involved. \ndotnet/runtime#67011  adds support for OCSP stapling to SslStream  client usage on Linux, with \ndotnet/runtime#69833  addin', 'g the Linux server -side counterpart, and dotnet/runtime#71570  adds \nclient -side support for Windows.  \nThe aforementioned changes are primarily about the performance of opening a connection. \nAdditional work has been done to improve that further in other ways. dotnet/runtime#69527  gets rid \nof allocations associated with several SafeHandle  instances that were being created unnecessarily on \nLinux as part of establishing a TLS connection. Thi', 's highlights the benefits of doing profiling  on \nmultiple platforms, as while these SafeHandle s were necessary in the Windows implementation, they \nwere fairly meaningless in the Linux implementation (due to differences between SChannel and \nOpenSSL), and were only brought along for the ride because of  how the platform -abstraction layer \n(PAL) was defined to reuse most of the SslStream  code across platforms. And dotnet/runtime#68188  \navoids', ' several collections allocated as part of the TLS han dshake. This one is particularly interesting as \nit’s come up multiple times in the past in various libraries. Imagine you have a lazily initialized \nproperty like this:  \nprivate List<T>? _items;  \npublic List<T> Items => _items ??= new List<T>();  \nAnd then some code in the same implementation comes along and wants to read the contents of \nthese items. That code might look like:  \nif (Items.', 'Count > 0) { ... }  \nbut the very act of accessing Items  just to check its count forces the collection into existence (with a  0 \nCount ). If the code instead checks:  \nif (_items is List<T> items && items. Count > 0) { ... }  \nIt can save that unnecessary collection allocation. The approach is made even simpler with C# pattern \nmatching:  \nif (_items is { Count: > 0 }) items) { ... }  \nThis is one of those things that’s incredibly obvious once ', 'you “see” it and realize what’s happening, \nbut you often miss until it jumps out at you in a profiler.  \ndotnet/runtime#69098  is another go od example of how profiling can lead to insights about \nallocations that can be removed. Application -Layer Protocol Negotation (ALPN) allows code \nestablishing a TLS connection to piggy -back on the roundtrips that are being used for the TLS \nhandshake anyway to negotiate some higher -level protocol that w', 'ill end up being used as well. A very \ncommon use -case, for example, is for an HTTPS client/server to negotiate which version of HTTP \nshould be used. This information is exposed from SslStream  as an SslApplicati onProtocol  struct \nreturned from its NegotiatedApplicationProtocol  property, but as the actual negotiated protocol \ncan be arbitrary data, SslApplicationProtocol  just wraps a byte[] . The implementation had been  \n179 CHAPTER 16 | N', 'etworking  \n dutifully allocating a byte[]  to hold the bytes  passed around as part of ALPN, since we need such a \nbyte[]  to store in the SslApplicationProtocol . But while the byte data can be arbitrary, in practice \nby far the most common byte sequences are equivalent to “http/1.1” for HTTP/1.1, “h2” for HTTP/2, \nand “h3” for HTTP/3. Thus, it makes sense to special -case those values and use a reusable cached \nbyte[]  singleton when one of th', 'ose values is needed. If SslApplicationProtocol  exposed the \nunderlying byte[]  directly to consumers, we’d be hesitant to use such si ngletons, as doing so would \nmean that if code wrote into the byte[]  it would potentially be changing the value for other \nconsumers in the same process. However, SslApplicationProtocol  exposes it as a \nReadOnlyMemory<byte> , which is only mutable via unsafe c ode (using the \nMemoryMarshal.TryGetArray  method),', ' and once you’re employing unsafe code to do “bad” things," \nall bets are off anyway. dotnet/runtime#63674  also removes allocations related to A LPN, in this case \navoiding the need for a byte[]  allocation on Linux when setting the negotiated protocol on a client \nSslStream . It uses stack memory instead of an array allocation for protocols up to 256 bytes in length, \nwhich is way larger than any in known use, and thus doesn’t bother to do anyt', 'hing fancy for the \nfallback path, which will never be used in practice. And dotnet/runtime#69103  further avoids ALPN -\nrelated allocations and work on Windows by entirely skipping some unnecessary code paths: various \nmethods can be invoked multiple times during a TLS handshake,  but even though the ALPN -related \nwork only needed to happen once the first time, the code wasn’t special -casing it and was instead \nrepeating the work over and over', '.  \nEverything discussed thus far was about establishing connections. What about the performan ce of \nreading and writing on that connection? Improvements have been made there, too, in particular \naround memory management and asynchrony. But first we need some context.  \nWhen async/await  were first introduced, Task  and Task<TResult>  were the only game i n town; while \nthe pattern -based mechanism the compiler supports for arbitrary “task -like', '” types enabled async  \nmethods to return other types, in practice it was only tasks (which also followed our guidance). We \nsoon realized, however, that a significant num ber of calls to a significant number of commonly -used \nasync APIs would actually complete synchronously. Consider, for example, a method like \nMemoryStream.ReadAsync : MemoryStream  is backed entirely by an in -memory buffer, so even though \nthe operation is “as ync,” every ca', 'll to it completes synchronously, as the operation can be performed \nwithout doing any potentially long -running I/O. Or consider FileStream.ReadAsync . By default \nFileStream  employs its own internal buffer. If you issue a call to FileStream.Rea dAsync  with your \nown buffer and ask for only, say, 16 bytes, under the covers FileStream.ReadAsync  will issue the \nactual native call with its own much larger buffer, which by default is 4K. The firs', 't time you issue your \n16-byte read, actual I/O will be req uired and the operation is likely to complete asynchronously. But \nthe next 255 calls you make could simply end up draining the remainder of the data read into that 4K \nbuffer, in which case 255 of the 256 “async” operations actually complete synchronously. If the \nmethod returns a Task<int> , every one of those 255 synchronously -completing calls could still end \nup allocating a Task<in', 't> , just to hand back the int that’s already known. Various techniques were \ndevised to minimize this, e.g.  if the int is one of a few well -known values (e.g. -1 through 8), then the \nasync method infrastructure will hand back a pre -allocated and cached Task<int>  instance for that \nvalue, and various stream implementations (including FileStream ) would cache the previously -\nreturned Task<int>  and hand it back for the next call as well if t', 'he next call yielded exactly the same \nnumber of bytes. But those optimizations don’t fully mitigate the issue. Instead, we introduced the \nValueTask<TResult>  struct and provided the necessary “builder” t o allow async  methods to return  \n180 CHAPTER 16 | Networking  \n them. ValueTask<TResult>  was simply a discrimated union between a TResult  and Task<TResult> . If \nan async method completed asynchronously (or if it failed synchronously), well', ', it would simply \nallocate the Task<TResult>  as it otherwise would have and return that task wrapped in a \nValueTask<TResult> . But if the method actually completed synchronously and successfully, it would \ncreate a ValueTask<TResult>  that just wrapped the resulting TResult , which then eliminates all \nallocat ion overhead for the synchronously -completing case. Yay, everyone’s happy. Well, almost \neveryone. For really hot paths, especially th', 'ose lower down in the stack that many other code paths \nbuild on top of, it can also be beneficial to avoid the allocations even for the asynchronously \ncompleting case. To address that, .NET Core 2.1 saw the introduction of the \nIValueTaskSource<TResult>  interface along with enabling ValueTask<TResult>  to wrap an instance \nof that interface in addition to a TResult  or a Task<TRes ult>  (at which point it also became \nmeaningful to introduce a', ' non -generic ValueTask  and the associated IValueTaskSource ). Someone \ncan implement this interface with whatever behaviors they want, although we codified the typical \nimplementation of the core as ync logic into the ManualResetValueTaskSourceCore  helper struct, \nwhich is typically embedded into some object, with the interface methods delegating to \ncorresponding helpers on the struct. Why would someone want to do this? Most commonly, it’s to', ' be \nable t o reuse the same instance implementing this interface over and over and over. So, for example, \nSocket  exposes a ValueTask<int> ReceiveAsync  method, and it caches a single instance of an \nIValueTaskSource<int>  implementation for use with such receives. As lo ng as you only ever have \none receive pending on a given socket at a time (which is the 99.999% case), every ReceiveAsync  call \nwill either return a ValueTask<int>  wrapped ar', 'ound an int value or a ValueTask<int>  wrapped \naround that reusable IValueTaskSource<int> , making all use of ReceiveAsync  ammortized \nallocation -free (there is another instance used for SendAsync , such that you can have a concurrent \nread and write on the socket and still avoid allocations). However, implementing this suppor t is still \nnon-trivial, and can be super hard when dealing with an operation that’s composed of multiple \nsuboperatio', 'ns, which is exactly where async/await  shine. Thus, C# 10 added support for overriding \nthe default builder that’s used on an individual asyn c method (e.g.  such that someone could provide \ntheir own builder for a ValueTask<int> -returning method instead of the one that allocates Task<int>  \ninstances for asynchronous completion) and .NET 6 included the new \nPoolingAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder  and PoolingAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder<>  types. Wi', 'th \nthose, an async  method like:  \npublic async ValueTask< int> ReadAsync (Memory< byte> buffer) { ... }  \ncan be changed to be:  \n[AsyncMethodBuilder (typeof(PoolingAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder<>))]  \npublic async ValueTask< int> ReadAsync (Memory< byte> buffer) { ... }  \nwhich will cause the C# compiler to emit the implementation of this method using \nPoolingAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder<int>  instead of the default \nAsyncValueTaskMethodBuilder<i', 'nt> . The implementation of \nPoolingAsyncVa lueTaskMethodBuilder<TResult>  is true to its name; it employs pooling to avoid \nmost  of the allocation asynchronous completion would otherwise experience (I say “most” because \nthe pooling by design tries to balance all the various costs involved and may sti ll sometimes allocate), \nand makes it easy for methods implemented with async /await  to reap those benefits. So, if this was \nall introduced in ', 'the last release, why am I talking about it now? Pooling isn’t free. There are various  \n181 CHAPTER 16 | Networking  \n tradeoffs involved in its us age, and while it can make microbenchmarks look really good, it can also \nnegatively impact real -world usage, e.g.  by increasing the cost of garbage collections that do occur by \nincreasing the number of Gen2 to Gen0 references that exist. As such, while the  functionality is \nvaluable, we’ve been ', 'methodical in where and how we use it, choosing to do so more slowly and only \nemploying it after sufficient analysis deems it’s worthwhile.  \nSuch is the case with SslStream . With dotnet/runtime#69418 , two core and hot async  methods on \nSslStream ’s read path were annotated to use pooling.

I find this one \nparticularly interesting, as it highlights a new and powerful C# 11 and .NET 7 feature: static abstract \nmembers in interfaces. Ssl', 'Stream , as with every Stream , exposes both synchronous and asynchronous \nmethods for reading and writing. And as you may be aware, the code within SslStream  for \nimplementing reads and writes is not particularly small. Thus, we really want to avoid having to \ndupli cate all of the code paths, once for synchronous work and once for asynchronous work, when in \nreality the only place that bifurcation is needed is at the leaves where calls into th', 'e underlying Stream  \nare made to perform the actual I/O. Historically, we’ve had two different mechanisms we’ve employed \nin dotnet/runtime  for handling such unification. One is to make all methods async , but with an \nadditional bool useAsync  parameter that gets fed through the cal l chain, then branching based on it \nat the leaves, e.g.  \npublic static void Work(Stream s) =>  \n    A(s, useAsyunc: false).GetAwaiter ().GetResult (); // GetResu', 'lt() to propagate any \nexceptions  \n \npublic static Task WorkAsync (Stream S) =>  \n    A(s, useAsync: true); \n \ninternal  static async Task A(Stream s, bool useAsync)  \n{ \n    ... \n    await B(s, useAsync);  \n    ... \n} \n \nprivate static async Task B(Stream s, bool useAsync)  \n{ \n    ... \n    int bytesRead = useAsync ?  \n        await s. ReadAsync (buffer) :  \n        s.Read(buffer. Span); \n    ... \n} \nThis way most of the logic and code is share', 'd, and when useAsync is false, everything completes \nsynchronously and so we don’t pay for allocation that might otherwise be associated with the async -\nness. The other approach is similar in spirit, but instead of a bool  parameter, taking advantage of \ngeneric specialization and interface -implementing structs. Consider an interface like:  \ninterface  IReader \n{ \n    ValueTask< int> ReadAsync (Stream s, Memory< byte> buffer);  \n}  \n183 CHAPTER', ' 16 | Networking  \n We can then declare tw o implementations of this interface:  \nstruct SyncReader : IReader  \n{ \n    public ValueTask< int> ReadAsync (Stream s, Memory< byte> buffer) =>  \n        new ValueTask< int>(s.Read(buffer. Span)); \n} \n \nstruct AsyncReader : IReader  \n{ \n    public ValueTask< int> ReadAsync (Stream s, Memory< byte> buffer) =>  \n        s.ReadAsync (buffer);  \n} \nThen we can redeclare our earlier example as:  \npublic stat', 'ic void Work(Stream s) =>  \n    A(stream, default(SyncReader)). GetAwaiter ().GetResult (); // to propagate any exceptions  \n \npublic static Task WorkAsync (Stream S) =>  \n    A(s, default(AsyncReader));  \n \ninternal  static async Task A<TReader>(Stream s, TReader reader) where TReader : IReader  \n{ \n    ... \n    await B(s, reader);  \n    ... \n} \n \nprivate static async Task B<TReader>(Stream s, TReader reader)  where TReader : IReader  \n{ \n    ..', '. \n    int bytesRead = await reader. ReadAsync (s, buffer);  \n    ... \n} \nNote that the generic constraint on the TReader  parameter here allows the implementation to invoke \nthe interface methods, and passing the structs as a generic avoids boxing. One code path supporting \nboth sync and async implementations.  \nThis latter generic approach is how SslStream  has historically handled the unification of its sync and \nasync implementations. It gets', ' better in .NET 7 with C# 11 now that we have static abstract methods \nin interfaces. We can instead declare our interface as (note the static abstract  addition):  \ninterface  IReader \n{ \n    static abstract  ValueTask< int> ReadAsync (Stream s, Memory< byte> buffer);  \n} \nour types as (note the static  addition):  \nstruct SyncReader : IReader  \n{ \n    public static ValueTask< int> ReadAsync (Stream s, Memory< byte> buffer) =>  \n        new Valu', 'eTask< int>(s.Read(buffer. Span)); \n} \n \nstruct AsyncReader : IReader   \n184 CHAPTER 16 | Networking  \n { \n    public static ValueTask<int> ReadAsync (Stream s, Memory< byte> buffer) =>  \n        s.ReadAsync (buffer);  \n} \nand our consuming methods as (note the removal of the parameter and the switch to calling static \nmethods on the type parameter):  \npublic static void Work(Stream s) =>  \n    A<SyncReader>(stream). GetAwaiter ().GetResult (); /', '/ to propagate any exceptions  \n \npublic static Task WorkAsync (Stream S) =>  \n    A<AsyncReader>(s);  \n \ninternal  static async Task A<TReader>(Stream s) where TReader : IReader  \n{ \n    ... \n    await B<TReader>(s);  \n    ... \n} \n \nprivate static async Task B<TReader>(Stream s) where TReader : IReader  \n{ \n    ... \n    int bytesRead = await TReader. ReadAsync (s, buffer);  \n    ... \n} \nNot only is this cleaner, but from a performance perspectiv', 'e we no longer need to pass around the  \ndummy generic parameter, which is general goodness, but for an async method it’s particularly \nbeneficial because the state machine type ends up storing all parameters as fields, which means every \nparameter can increase the amount of allocation incurred by  an async method if the method ends up \ncompleting asynchronously. dotnet/runtime#65239  flipped SslStream  (and NegotiateStream ) to \nfollow this appr', 'oach. It’s also used in multiple other places now throughout dotnet/runtime. \ndotnet/runtime#69278  from [@teo -tsirpanis](https://github.com/teo -tsirpanis) changed the \nRandomAccess  class’ implementation for Windows and the ThreadPool ’s mech anism for invoking work \nitems to use the same approach. Further, dotnet/runtime#63546  did the same in the Regex  \nimplementation, and in particular in the new RegexOptions.NonBacktracking  implementatio', 'n, as a \nway to abstract over DFA and NFA -based operations using the same code (this technique was since \nfurther utilized in NonBacktracking , such as by dotnet/runtime#71234  from \n[@olsaarik](https://github.com/olsaarik)). And potentially most impactfully, dotnet/runtime#73768  did \nso with IndexOfAny  to abstract away the differences between IndexOfAny  and IndexOfAnyExcept  \n(also for the Last  variants). With the introduction of the {Last}', 'IndexOfAnyExcept  variations \npreviously mentioned, we now have four different variants of IndexOfAny  with essentially the same \nfunctionality: searching forward or  backwards, and with equality or inequality. While more challenging \nto try to unify the directional aspect, this PR utilized this same kind of generic specialization to hide \nbehind an interface the ability to negate the comparison; the core implementations  of these methods \ncan th', 'en be implemented once and passed either a Negate  or DontNegate  implementation of the \ninterface. The net result is not only that the new Except  varieties immediately gained all of the \noptimizations of the non -Except  varieties, but a lso the goal of trying to make everything consistent \nresulted in finding places where we were missing optimization opportunities in existing methods \n(gaps that the PR also rectified).   \n185 CHAPTER 16 | Netw', 'orking  \n private static readonly  string s_haystack = new \nHttpClient ().GetStringAs ync("https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661 -0.txt").Result; \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic int LastIndexOfAny () => s_haystack.

Most of the folks focusing on networking in .NET 7 wer', 'e focused on \ntaking the preview support for HTTP/3 that shipped in .NET 6 and making it a first -class supported \nfeature in .NET 7. That included functional improve ments, reliability and correctness fixes, and \nperformance improvements, such that HTTP/3 can now be used via HttpClient  on both Windows \nand Linux (it depends on an underlying QUIC implementation in the msquic component, which isn’t \ncurrently available for macOS). However, there ', 'were significant improvements throughout the HTTP \nstack, beyond HTTP/3.  \nOne aspect of HttpClient  that cuts across all versions of HTTP is support for handling and \nrepresenting headers. While significant improvements went into previou s releases to trim down the \nsize of the data structures used to store header information, further work on this front was done for \n.NET 7. dotnet/runtime#62981 , for example, improves the data s tructure used t', 'o store headers. One of \nthe things HttpHeaders  needs to deal with is that there’s no defined limit to the number of headers \nthat can be sent with an HTTP request or response (though in order to mitigate possible denial of \nservice attacks, th e implementation has a configurable limit for how many bytes of headers are \naccepted from the server), and thus it needs to be able to handle an arbitrary number of them and to \ndo so with efficient acce', 'ss. As such, for the longest time HttpHeaders  has used  a Dictionary<,>  to \nprovide O(1)  lookup into these headers. However, while it’s valid to have large numbers of headers, \nit’s most common to only have a handful, and for only a few items, the overheads involved in a hash \ntable like Dictionary<>  can be more than just storing the elements in an array and doing an O(N)  \nlookup by doing a linear search through all the elements (algorithmic', ' complexity ignores the \n“constants” involved, so for a small N, an O(N)  algorithm might be much faster and lighterweight than \nan O(1) ). This PR takes advantage of that and teaches HttpHeaders  how to use either an array or a \ndictionary; for common numbers of headers (the current threshold is 64), it just uses an array, and in \nthe rare case where that threshold is exceeded, it grad uates into a dictionary. This reduces the \nallocation in Htt', 'pHeader  in all but the most niche cases while also making it faster for lookups.  \nAnother header -related size reduction comes in dotne t/runtime#64105 . The internal representation of \nheaders involves a HeaderDescriptor  that enables “known headers” (headers defined in the HTTP \nspecifications or that we’re otherwise aware of and want to optimize) to share common data, e.g.  if a \nresponse hea der matches one of these known headers, we can ju', 'st use the header name string \nsingleton rather than allocating a new string for that header each time we receive it. This \nHeaderDescriptor  accomodated both known headers and custom headers by having two fiel ds, one \nfor known header data (which would be null for custom headers) and one for the header name. \nInstead, this PR employs a relatively -common technique of having a single object  field that then \nstores either the known header inform', 'ation or the name, sin ce the known header information itself \nincludes the name, and thus we don’t need the duplication. At the expense of a type check when we  \n186 CHAPTER 16 | Networking  \n need to look up information from that field, we cut the number of fields in half. And while this \nHeaderDescriptor  is itself a struct, it’s stored in header collections, and thus by cutting the size of the \nHeaderDescriptor  in half, we can significantly ', 'reduce the size of those collections, especially when \nmany custom headers are involved.  \nprivate readonly  string[] _strings = new[] { "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" , "Access-\nControl-Allow-Origin", "Cache-Control" , "Connection" , "Date", "Server"  }; \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic HttpResponseHeaders GetHeaders () \n{ \n    var headers = new HttpResponseMessage ().Headers; \n    foreach (string s in _strings)  \n    { \n        headers.

The initial design and \nimplementation of this type were overly flexible, with a mechanism for custom validation of values, \nwhich entailed multip le fields for storing things like an Action<>  callback to use for validation. But as \nit turns out in practice, that validation was only used for one specific consumer, and so rather than \nmaking everyone pay for the extra space th', 'at wasn’t typically used, t he validation was instead \nextracted out to just the call sites it was required.  \nA more focused allocation reduction comes in dotnet/runtime#63641 . The shared internal utility \nmethod HttpRulePa rser.GetHostLength  was using string.Substring  in order to hand back the \nparsed host information, but only some of the callers needed this. Rather than making everyone pay \nfor something that not everyone needed, this logi', 'c was moved into only the call sites  that needed it.  \nOther small allocation improvements were also made outside of headers. For example, when new \nHTTP/1 and HTTP/2 connections are created, the implementation queues a work item to the thread \npool to handle the actual creation, primarily to es cape locks that might be held higher in the call \nstack. To do so, it used Task.Run . And while normally Task.Run  is a fine thing to use, in this case ', 'there \nwere two issues: the resulting Task  was being ignored, such that any unexpected exceptions would \njust be eaten, and the lambda being passed to Task.Run  was closing over this  and a local, which \nmeans the C# compiler will have generated code to allocate both a “display class” (an object to store \nthe state being passed in) for the closure and then also a del egate to a method on that display class. \nInstead, dotnet/runtime#68750  switch', 'es it to use ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem , using the \noverload that takes a generic TState , and passing in a tuple o f all required state in order to avoid \nboth superfluous allocations.   \n187 CHAPTER 16 | Networking  \n Folks using HTTP often need to go through a proxy server, and in .NET the ability to go through an \nHTTP proxy is represented via the IWebProxy  interface; it has three members, GetProxy  for getting the \nUri of the proxy to us', 'e for a given destination Uri, the IsBypassed  method which says whether a \ngiven Uri should go through a proxy or not, and then a Credentials  property to be used when \naccessing the target proxy. The canonical implementati on of IWebProxy  provided in the core libraries \nis the aptly named WebProxy . WebProxy  is fairly simple: you give it a proxy Uri, and then calls to \nGetProxy  return that proxy Uri if the destination isn’t to be bypassed. W', 'hether a Uri should be \nbypassed is de termined by two things (assuming a non -null proxy Uri was provided): did the \nconstructor of the WebProxy  specify that “local” destinations should be bypassed (and if so, is this \ndestination local), or does this destination address match any of any number o f regular expressions \nprovided. As it turns out, this latter aspect has been relatively slow and allocation -heavy in all previous \nreleases of .NET,', ' for two reasons: every call to check whether an address was bypassed was recreating \na Regex  instance for eve ry supplied regular expression, and every call to check whether an address \nwas bypassed was deriving a new string  from the Uri to use to match against the Regex . In .NET 7, \nboth of those issues have been fixed, yielding significant improvements if you rely on this regular \nexpression functionality. dotnet/runtime#73803  from \n[@oneh', 'ourlate](https://gith ub.com/onehourlate) changed the handling of the collection of these \nRegex  instances. The problem was that WebProxy  exposes an ArrayList  (this type goes back to the \nbeginning of .NET and was created pre -generics), which the consumer could modify, and so WebProxy  \nhad to assume the collection was modified between uses and addressed that by simply creating new \nRegex  instances on every use; not good. Instead, this PR cr', 'eates a custom ArrayList -derived type \nthat can track all relevant mutations, and then only if the collection is changed (which is incredibly \nrare, bordering on never) do the Regex  instances need to be recreated. And dotnet/runtime#73807  \ntakes advantage of stack allocation and the MemoryExtensions.TryWrite  method with string \ninterpolation to format the text into stack memory, avoiding the string allocation. This, combined with \nthe new Reg', 'ex.IsMatch(ReadOnlySpan<char>)  overload that enables us to match against that \nstackalloc ’d span, make s that aspect of the operation allocation -free as well. Altogether, drastic \nimprovements:  \nprivate WebProxy _proxy = new WebProxy ("http://doesntexist" , BypassOnLocal: false, new[] { \n@"\\.microsoft.com" , @"\\.dot.net" , @"\\.bing.com"  }); \nprivate Uri _destinatio n = new \nUri("https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.webproxy" ); \n', " \n[Benchmark]  \npublic bool IsBypassed () => _proxy.

New features in .NET 7 include support for customizing \ncontrac ts, polymorphic serialization , support for required members', ' , support for DateOnly / TimeOnly , \nsupport for IAsyncEnumerable<T>  and JsonDocument  in source generation, and support for \nconfiguring MaxDepth in JsonWriterOptions . However, there have also been new features specifically \nfocused on performance, and other changes about improving performance of JSON handling in a \nvariety of  scenarios.  \nOne of the biggest performance pitfalls we’ve seen developers face with System.Text.Json  has to do \nwi', 'th how the library caches data. In order to achieve good serialization and deserialization \nperformance when the source generator isn’t used, System.Text.Json  uses reflection emit to \ngenerate custom code for reading/writing members of the types being processed. Instead of then \nhaving to pay reflection invoke costs on every access, the library incurs a much larger one -time cost \nper type to perform this code generation, but then all subsequent', ' handling of these types is very \nfast… assuming the generated code is available for use. These generated handlers need to be stored \nsomewhere, and the location that’s used for storing them is them is JsonSeriali zerOptions . The \nidea was intended to be that developers would instantiate an options instance once and pass it \naround to all of their serialization/deserialization calls; thus, state like these generated handlers could \nbe cached on ', 'them. And that works wel l when developers follow the recommended model. But when \nthey don’t, performance falls off a cliff, and hard. Instead of “just” paying for the reflection invoke \ncosts, each use of a new JsonSerializerOptions  ends up re -generating via reflection emit those \nhandlers, skyrocketing the cost of serialization and deserialization. A super simple benchmark makes \nthis obvious:  \nprivate JsonSerializerOptions _options = new J', 'sonSerializerOptions (); \nprivate MyAmazingClass _instance = new MyAmazingClass (); \n \n[Benchmark (Baseline = true)] \npublic string ImplicitOptions () => JsonSerializer.

The source generator emits helpers for \nperforming the seriali zation/deserialization work, and these are then invoked by Json', 'Serializer  via \ndelegates (as part of abstracting away all the different implementation strategies for how to get and \nset members on the types being serialized and deserialized). Previously, the se helpers were being \nemitted as static methods, which in turn meant that the delegates were being created to static \nmethods. Delegates to instance methods are a bit faster to invoke than delegates to static methods, \nso this PR made a simple few -lin', 'e chang e for the source generator to emit these as instance methods \ninstead.  \nYet another for JsonSerializer  comes in dotnet/runtime#73338 , which improves allocation with how \nit utilizes Utf8JsonWrite r. Utf8JsonWriter  is a class, and every time JsonSerializer  would write \nout JSON, it would allocate a new Utf8JsonWriter  instance. In turn, Utf8JsonWriter  needs \nsomething to write to, and although the serializer was using an IBufferWrite', 'r  implementation th at \npooled the underlying byte[]  instances employed, the implementation of IBufferWriter  itself is a \nclass that JsonSerializer  would allocate. A typical Serialize  call would then end up allocating a \nfew extra objects and an extra couple of hundred bytes jus t for these helper data structures. To \naddress that, this PR takes advantage of [ThreadStatic] , which can be put onto static fields to make \nthem per -thread rathe', 'r than per -process. From whatever thread is performing the (synchronous)  \n192 CHAPTER 17 | JSON  \n Serialize  operation, i t then ensures the current thread has a Utf8JsonWriter  and IBufferWriter  \ninstance it can use, and uses them; for the most part this is straightforward, but it needs to ensure that \nthe serialization operation itself doesn’t try to recursively serialize, in which case these objects could \nend up being used erroneously whi', 'le already in use. It also needs to make sure that the pooled \nIBufferWriter  doesn’t hold on to any of its byte[] s while it’s not being used. That instance gets its \narrays from ArrayPool<T> , and we want those arrays to be usable in the meantime by anyone else \nmaking use of the pool, not sequestered off in this cached IBufferWriter  implementation. This \noptimization is also only really meaningful for small object graphs being serialized, and', ' only applies to \nthe synchronous operations (asynchronous operations would require a more complicated pooling \nmechanism, since the operation isn’t tied to a specific thread, and the overhead of such complication \nwould likely outweigh the modest gain this optimiz ation provides).  \nprivate byte[] _data = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic string SerializeToString () => JsonSerializer.

Thankf ully, System.Xml gets a bit of performance \nlove in .NET 7, in particular around reducing allocation on some commonly used code paths.  \nSometimes a performance fix is as easy as changing a single number. Th', 'at’s the case with \ndotnet/runtime#63459  from [@chrisdcmoore](https://github.com/chrisdcmoore), which addresses a \nlong-standing issue with the asynchronous methods on the popular XmlReader . When XmlReader  was \noriginally written, whoever develope d it chose a fairly common buffer size to be used for read \noperations, namely 4K or 8K char s depending on various conditions. When XmlReader  later gained \nasynchronous reading functionality, for w', 'hatever reason a much, much larger buffer size of 64K char s \nwas selected (presumably in hopes of minimizing the number of asynchronous operations that would \nneed to be employed, but the actual rationale is lost to history). A key problem with such a buffer size, \nbeyond it leading to a lot of allocation, is the alloc ation it produces typically ends up on the Large \nObject Heap (LOH). By default, under the expectation that really large objects', ' are long -lived, objects \ngreater than 85K bytes are allocated into the LOH, which is treated as part of Gen 2, and that makes \nsuch allocation if not long-lived even more expensive in terms of overall impact on the system. Well, \n64K char s is 128K bytes, which puts it squarely above that threshold. This PR lowers the size from 64K \nchar s to 32K char s, putting it below the threshold (and generally reducing allocation pressure, how \nmuch memor', 'y needs to be zero’d, etc). While it’s still a very large allocation, and in the future we \ncould look at pooling the buffer or employing a smaller one (e.g.  no different from what’s done for \nthe synchronous APIs), this simple one -number change alone makes a substantial difference for \nshorter input documents (while not perceivably negatively impacting larger ones).  \nprivate readonly  XmlReaderSettings _settings = new XmlReaderSettings { Asyn', 'c  = true }; \nprivate MemoryStream _stream;  \n \n[Params(10, 1_000_000)] \npublic int ItemCount;  \n \n[GlobalSetup]  \npublic void Setup() \n{ \n    _stream = new MemoryStream (); \n    using XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.

This included using a \nReadOn', 'lySpan<byte>  initialized from an RVA static instead of a large byte[]  array that would need to \nbe allocated. And dotn et/runtime#60057  from [@kronic](https://github.com/kronic), which converted \n~400 string  creations in the System.Private.Xml  assembly to use interpolated strings. Many of \nthese cases were stylistic, converting something like string1 + ":" + string2  into \n$"{string1}:{string2}" ; I say stylistic here because the C# compiler', ' will generate the exact same \ncode for both of those, a call to string.Concat(string1, ":", string2) , given that there’s a \nConcat  overload that accepts three strings. However, some of the cha nges do impact allocation. For \nexample, the private XmlTextWriter.GeneratePrefix  method had the code:  \nreturn "d" + _top.ToString ("d", CultureInfo. InvariantCulture ) \n     + "p" + temp.ToString ("d", CultureInfo. InvariantCulture ); \nwhere _top  and', ' temp  are both ints. This will result in allocating two temporary strings and then \nconcatenating those with the two constant strings. Instead, the PR changed it to:  \nreturn string.Create(CultureInfo. InvariantCulture , $"d{_top:d}p{temp:d}" ); \nwhich while shorter i s also more efficient, avoiding the intermediate string allocations, as the custom \ninterpolated string handler used by string.Create  will format those into a pooled buffer rather', ' than \nallocating intermediate temporaries.  \nXmlSerializer  is also quite popular  and also gets a (small) allocation reduction, in particular for \ndeserialization. XmlSerializer  has two modes for generating serialization/deserialization routines: \nusing reflection emit to dynamically generate IL at run -time that are tuned to the specific  shape of the \ntypes being serialized/deserialized, and the XML Serializer Generator Tool  (sgen), which g', 'enerates a \n.dll containing the same s upport, just ahead -of-time (a sort -of precursor to the Roslyn source  \n195 CHAPTER 18 | XML  \n generators we love today). In both cases, when deserializing, the generated code wants to track which \nproperties of the object being deserialized have already been set, and to do that, it  uses a bool[]  as a \nbit array. Every time an object is deserialized, it allocates a bool[]  with enough elements to track \n', 'every member of the type. But in common usage, the vast majority of types being deserialized only \nhave a relatively small number of pro perties, which means we can easily use stack memory to track \nthis information rather than heap memory. That’s what dotnet/runtime#66914  does. It updates both \nof the code generators to stackall oc into a Span<bool>  for less than or equal to 32 values, and \notherwise fall back to the old approach of heap -allo', 'cating the bool[]  (which can also then be stored \ninto a Span<bool>  so that the subsequent code paths simply use a span instead of an array). Y ou can \nsee this quite easily in the .NET Object Allocation Tracking tool in Visual Studio.

These PRs don’t change any code materially, but instead cons olidate all of \nthe various cryptography -related assemblies in the core libraries into a single \nSystem.Security.Cryptography  assembly. When .NET Core was first envisioned, a goal was to make \nit extremely modular, and large swaths of code were teased apart t o create many smaller assemblies. \nFor example, cryptographic functionality was split between \nSystem.Security.Cr', 'yptography.Algorithms.dll , System.Security.Cryptography.Cng.dll , \nSystem.Security.Cryptography.Csp.dll , System.Security.Cryptography.Encoding.dll , \nSystem.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl.dll , System.Security.Cryptography.Primitives.dll , \nand System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.dll . You can see this if you look in your \nshared framework folder for a previous release, e.g.  here’s mine for .NET 6 : \n \nThese PRs move all of that code ', 'into a single System.Security.Cryptography.dll  assembly. This has \nseveral benefits. First, crypto is used in a huge number of applications, and most apps would end up \n \n199 CHAPTER 19 | Cryptography  \n requiring multiple (or even most) of these assemblies . Every assembly that’s loaded adds overhead. \nSecond, a variety of helper files had to be compiled into each assembly, leading to overall larger \namount of compiled code to be distributed. A', 'nd third, we weren’t able to implement everything as \noptimal as we’ d have otherwise liked due to functionality in one assembly not exposed to another \n(and we avoid using InternalsVisibleTo  as it hampers maintainability and impedes other analysis \nand optimizations). Now in .NET 7, the shared framework looks more like this:  \n \nInteresting, you still see a bunch of assemblies there, but all except for \nSystem.Security.Cryptography.dll  are tin', 'y; that’s because these are simple facades. Because we \nneed to support binaries built for .NET 6 and earlier running on .NET 7, we need to  be able to handle \nbinaries that refer to types in these assemblies, but in .NET 7, those types actually live in \nSystem.Security.Cryptography.dll . .NET provides a solution for this in the form of the \n[TypeForwardedTo(...)]  attribute, which enables one asse mbly to say “hey, if you’re looking for type \nX,', ' it now lives over there.” And if you crack open one of these assemblies in a tool like ILSpy , you can \nsee they’re essentially empty except for a bunch o f these attributes:  \n \n200 CHAPTER 19 | Cryptography  \n  \nIn addition to the startup and maintenance wins this provides, this has also enabled further \nsubsequent optimization. For example, there’s a lot of object cloning that goes on in the innards of \nthis library. Various objects are used ', 't o wrap native handles to OS cryptographic resources, and to \nhandle lifetime semantics and ownership appropriately, there are many cases where a native handle is \nduplicated and then wrapped in one or more new managed objects. In some cases, however, the \noriginal resource is then destroyed because it’s no longer needed, and the whole operation could \nhave been made more efficient if the original resource just had its ownership transferred to t', 'he new \nobjects rather than being duplicated and destroyed. This kind  of ownership transfer typically is hard to \ndo between assemblies as it generally requires public API that’s not focused on such usage patterns, \nbut with internals access, this can be overcome. dotnet/runtime#72120  does this, for example, to \nreduce allocation of various resources inside the RSACng , DSACng , ECDsaCng , and ECDiffieHellmanCng  \npublic types.  \nIn terms of ac', 'tual code improvements, there are many. One category of improvements is around \n“one-shot” operations. With many forms of data processing, all of the data needn’t be processed in \none operation. A block of data can be processed, then another, then another, until finally there’s no \nmore data to be processed. In such usage, there’s often  some kind of state carried over from the \nprocessing of one block to the processing of the next, and then the ', 'processing of the last block is \nspecial as it needn’t carry over anything and instead needs to perform whatever work is required to \nend the whole operation, e.g.  outputting any final footer or checksum that might be required as part \nof the format. Thus, APIs that are able to handle arbitrary number of blocks of data are often a bit \nmore expensive in one way, shape, or form than APIs that only suppor t a single input; this latter \ncategory is', ' known as “one shot” operations, because they do everything in “one shot.” In some cases, \none-shot operations can be significantly cheaper, and in other cases they merely avoid some \nallocations that would have been necessary to transfer state from the processing of one block of data \nto the next. dotnet/runtime#58270  from [@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones) and \ndotnet/runtime#65725  from [@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones) both impr', 'oved the \nperformance of various one -shot operations on “symmetric” cryptograhic algorithms (algorithms that \nuse the same key information to both encrypt an d decrypt), like AES. The former does so by \nrefactoring the implementations to avoid some reset work that’s not necessary in the case of one -\nshots because the relevant state is about to go away, anyway, and that in turns also allows the \nimplementation to s tore less of certain kinds of ', 'state.

As has been seen in many other PRs referenced throughout this post, using \nstackalloc  is a very effective way to get rid o f array allocations in many situations. It’s used \neffectively in multiple crypto PRs to avoid either temporary or pooled array allocations, such as \nin dotnet/runtime#64584  from [@vcsjones](htt ps://github.com/vcsjones), dotnet/runtime#69831  \nfrom [@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsj', 'ones), dotnet/runtime#70173  from \n[@vcsjo nes](https://github.com/vcsjones), dotnet/runtime#69812  from \n[@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones), and dotnet/runtime#69448  from \n[@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones). Sometimes this is used when calling an API that has \nmultiple overloads, including one taking an array and one taking a span. Othertimes it’s used \nwith P/Invokes that often just pass out a small amount of data.  Sometimes it’s ', 'used to avoid \ntemporary array allocations, and sometimes it’s used in places where pooling was used \npreviously, but the data is often small enough to avoid even the overheads of pooling.  \n• Avoiding double copies . Most of the crypto APIs that accept byte[] s and store them end up \nmaking defensive copies of those arrays rather than storing the original. This is fairly common \nthroughout .NET, but it’s especially common in the crypto stack, wh', 'ere the ability to trust the \ndata is as you expect it (a nd validate it) is paramount. In some cases, though, code ends up \nallocating a temporary byte[]  just to pass data into one of these APIs that copies and re -\nallocates, anyway. dotnet/runtime#71 102 from [@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones), \ndotnet/runtime#69024  from [@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones), dotnet/ru ntime#71015  \nfrom [@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones), and', ' dotnet/runtime#69534  from \n[@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones) deal with that duplication in some cases by extracting \na span to the original data instead of creating a temporary byte[] ; when that span is passed into \nthe target API, the target API still makes a copy, but we’ve avoided the first one and thus cut the \narray allocation for these operations effectively in half. dotnet/runtime#71888  from \n[@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjo', 'nes) is a variation on this theme, improving the internals of  \n202 CHAPTER 19 | Cryptography  \n Rfc2898DeriveBytes  to supports spans such that its constructors that accep t spans can then do \nthe more efficient thing.  \n• Replacing O(1)  data structures . O(1)  lookup data structures like Dictionary<,>  and \nHashSet<>  are the lifeblood of most applications and services, but sometimes algorithmic \ncomplexity is misleading. Yes, these provide ve', 'ry efficient searching, but there’s still overhead \nassociated with computing a hash code, mapping that hash code to a location in  the data \nstructure, and so on. If there’s only ever a handful of items (i.e.  the N in the complexity is really, \nreally small), it can be much faster to just do a linear search, and if N is sufficiently small, a data \nstructure may not even be needed at all : the search can just be open -coded as a waterfall of \nif', '/elseif/else constructs. That’s the case in a PR like dotnet/runtime#71341  from \n[@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones), where the 99.9 99% case involves just five strings \n(names of hash algorithms); it’s cheaper to just compare against each than it is do a \nHashSet<>.Contains , especially since the JIT now unrolls and vectorizes the comparison against \nthe constant string names.  \n• Simply avoid ing unnecessary work . The best optimizations ', 'are ones where you simply stop \ndoing work you don’t have to do. dotnet/runtime#68553  from \n[@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones) is a good exampl e of this. This code was performing a \nhash of some data in order to determine the length of resulting hashes for that particular \nconfiguration, but we actually know ahead of time exactly how long a hash for a given algorithm \nis going to be, and we already have in this code a cascading if/elseif/', 'else that’s checking for each \nknown algorithm, so we can instead just hardcode the length for each. dotnet/runtime#70589  \nfrom [@vcsjones](https://github .com/vcsjones) is another good example, in the same spirit of \nthe ownership transfer example mentioned earlier (but this one didn’t previously span assembly \nboundaries). Rather than in several places taking an X509Extension , serializing it to a byte[] , \nand passing that temporary byte[]  t', 'o something else that in turn makes a defensive copy, we \ncan instead provide an internal pathway for ownership transfer, bypassing all of the middle \nstages. Another good one is dotnet/runtime#70618  from \n[@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones), as it’s an example of how it pays to really understand \nyour dependencies. The implementation of symmetric encryption on macOS uses the \nCommonCrypto library. One of the fun ctions it exposes is CCCryp', 'torFinal , which is used at the \nend of the encryption/decryption process. However, there are several cases called out in the \ndocs where it’s unnecessary (“superfluous,” according to the docs), and so our dutifully calling it \neven in those situations is wasteful. The fix? Stop doing unnecessary work.  \n• New APIs . A bunch of new APIs were introduced for cryptography in .NET 7. Most are focused \non easing scenarios that were difficult to do cor', 'rectly before, like dotnet/runtime#66509  from \n[@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones) that provides an X500DistinguishedNameBuilder . But \nsome are focused squarely on performance. dotnet/runtime#57835  from \n[@vcsjones](https://github.com/vcsjones), for example, exposes a new RawDataMemory  property \non X509Certificate2 . Whereas the existing RawData  property returns a new byte[]  on every \ncall (again a defensive copy to avoid havi ng to de', 'al with the possiblity that the consumer \nmucked with the raw data), this new RawDataMemory  returns a ReadOnlyMemory<byte>  around \nthe internal byte[] . Since the only way to access and mutate that underlying byte[]  via a \nReadOnlyMemory<byte>  is via u nsafe interop code (namely via the \nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.MemoryMarshal  type), it doesn’t create a defensive copy and \nenables accessing this data freely without additional allocation', '.   \n203 CHAPTER 20 | Diagnostics  \n CHAPTER  20 \nDiagnostics  \nLet’s turn our attention to System.Diagnostics, which encompasses types ranging from process \nmanagement to tracing.  \nThe Process  class is used for a variety of purposes, including querying information about running \nprocesses, interacting with other processes (e.g.  being notified of their exiting), and launching \nprocesses. The performance of querying for information in particula', 'r ha d some notable improvements \nin .NET 7. Process  provides several APIs for querying for process information, one of the most \ncommon being Process.GetProcessesByName : apps that know the name of the process they’re \ninterested in can pass that to GetProcessesBy Name  and get back a Process[]  containing a Process  \nfor each. It turns out that previous releases of .NET were loading the full information (e.g.  all of its \nthreads) about every ', 'Process  on the machine in order to filter down to just those with the target \nname. dotnet/runtime#68705  fixes that by only loading the name for a process rather than all of the \ninformation for it. While this helps a bit with throughput, it helps a ton with allocation:  \n[Benchmark]  \npublic void GetProcessesByName () \n{ \n    foreach (Process p in Process. GetProcessesByName ("dotnet.exe" )) \n        p.Dispose(); \n} \nMethod  Runtime  Mean  Rat', 'io  Allocated  Alloc Ratio  \nGetProcessesByName  .NET 6.0  2.287 ms  1.00 447.86 KB  1.000  \nGetProcessesByName  .NET 7.0  2.086 ms  0.90 2.14 KB  0.005  \nAccessing various pieces of information from a Process  has also improved. If you load a Process  \nobject via the Process.GetProcesses  or Process.GetProcessesByName  methods, by design they load \nall information about the Process  being retrieved; internally their state will be populated such ', 'that \nsubsequent accesses to members of the Process  instance will be very fast. But, if you access a \nProcess  via Process.GetProces sById  or Process.GetCurrentProcess  (which is effectively \nGetProcessById  for the current process’ id), no information other than the process’ ID is \nprepopulated, and the state for the Process  instance is queried on -demand. In most cases, accessing \na single member of one of those lazy -loaded Process  instanc', 'es triggers loading all of the data for it, \nas the information is all available as part of the same native operation, e.g.  on Windows using \nNtQuerySystemInformation  and on Linux reading from /proc/pid/stat  and /proc/pid/status . But \nin some cases we can be more fine -grained about it, using APIs that serve up a subset of the data \nmuch more quickly. dotnet/runtime#59672  from [@SteveD unn](https://github.com/SteveDunn) \nprovides one such op', 'timization, using the QueryFullProcessImageName  on Windows to read the \nprocess name in response to Process.ProcessName  being used. If all you care about reading is the  \n204 CHAPTER 20 | Diagnostics  \n process’ name, it’s a huge boost in throughput, and even if you subsequently go on to read additional \nstate from the Process  and force it to load everything else, accessing the process name is so fast that \nit doesn’t add meaningful overhead t', 'o the all -up operation. This is visible in this  benchmark:  \n[Benchmark]  \npublic string GetCurrentProcessName () \n{ \n    using Process current = Process. GetCurrentProcess (); \n    return current. ProcessName ; \n} \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic string GetCurrentProcessNameAndWorkingSet () \n{ \n    using Process current = Process .GetCurrentProcess (); \n    return $"{current.ProcessName} {current.WorkingSet64}" ; \n} \nMethod  Runtime  Mean  Ratio  Alloc', 'ated  Alloc Ratio  \nGetCurrentProcessName  .NET 6.0  3,070.54 us  1.00 3954 B  1.00 \nGetCurrentProcessName  .NET 7.0  32.30 us  0.01 456 B  0.12 \n      \nGetCurrentProcessNameAndWorkingSet  .NET 6.0  3,055.70 us  1.00 4010 B  1.00 \nGetCurrentProcessNameAndWorkingSet  .NET 7.0  3,149.92 us  1.03 4186 B  1.04 \nInterestingly, this PR had a small deficiency we didn’t initially catch, which is that the \nQueryFullProcessImageName  API we switched to did', 'n’t work in the case of elevated/privileged \nprocesses. To accomodate those, dotnet/runtime#70073  from \n[@schuettecarsten](https://github.com/schuettecarsten) updated the code to keep both the new and \nold implementations, starting with the new one and then only falling back to the old if operating on \nan incomp atible process.  \nSeveral additional PRs helped out the Process  class. When launching processes with Process.Start  \non Unix, the impl', 'ementation was using Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes  as part of argument handling, \nresulting in a temporary array being allocated per a rgument; dotnet/runtime#71279  removes that \nper-argument allocation, instead using Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCount  to determine how large a \nspace is needed and then using the Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes  overload that accepts a span to encode \ndirectly into the native memory already being allocated. dotnet/runtime#71136  simpl', 'ifies and \nstreamlines the code involved in getting the “short name” of  a process on Windows for use in \ncomparing process names. And dotnet/runtime#45690  replaces a custom cache with use of \nArrayPool  in the Windows implementation of getting all process informatio n, enabling effective reuse \nof the array that ends up being used rather than having it sequestered off in the Process  \nimplementation forever.  \nAnother area of performance invest', 'ment has been in DiagnosticSource , and in particular around \nenumerating through data from Activity  instances. This work translates into faster integration and \ninteroperability via OpenTelemetry , in order to be able to export data from .NET Activity  information \nfaster. dotnet/runtime#67 012 from [@CodeBlanch](https://github.com/CodeBlanch), for example, \nimproved the performance of the internal DiagLinkedList<T>.DiagEnumerator  type that’s ', 'the  \n205 CHAPTER 20 | Diagnostics  \n enumerator returned when enumerating Activity.Links  and Activity.Events  by avoiding a copy \nof each  T value:  \nprivate readonly  Activity _activity;  \n \npublic Program() \n{ \n    using ActivitySource activitySource = new ActivitySource ("Perf7Source" ); \n    ActivitySource.

Stopwatch  is a simple type that’s very handy \nfor getting precise measurements and is thus used all over the place. But for folks that are really cost -\nsensitive, the fact that Stop', 'watch  is a class can be prohibitive, e.g.  writing:  \nStopwatch sw = Stopwatch. StartNew (); \n...; \nTimeSpan elapsed = sw. Elapsed; \nis easy, but allocates a new object just to measure.  To address this, Stopwatch  has for years exposed \nthe static GetTimestamp()  method which avoids that allocation, but consuming and translating the \nresulting long  value is complicated, requiring a formula involving using Stopwatch.Frequency  and \nTimeSpan.Tic', ' ksPerSecond  in the right incantation. To make this pattern easy, dotnet/runtime#66372  \nadds a static GetElapsedTime  method that handles that conversion, such that someone who wants \nthat last mi le of performance can write:  \nlong timestamp = Stopwatch.

After all, \nexceptions are by their very nature meant to be “exceptional” (in the “rare” sense), and thus wouldn’t \ntypically contribute to fast -path performance. Which  is a good thing, because fast -paths that throw \nexceptions in the common case are no longer fast: throwing exceptions is quite expensive.  \nInstead, one of the things we do concern ourselves with is how to minimize the impac', 't of checking for \nexceptional cond itions: the actual exception throwing may be unexpected and slow, but it’s super \ncommon to need to check for those unexpected conditions, and that checking should be very fast. We \nalso want such checking to minimally impact binary size, especially if we’re  going to have many such \nchecks all over the place, in generic code for which we end up with many copies due to generic \nspecialization, in functions that', ' might be inlined, and so on. Further, we don’t want such checks to \nimpede other optimizations; for exa mple, if I have a small function that wants to do some argument \nvalidation and would otherwise be inlineable, I likely don’t want the presence of exception throwing to \ninvalidate the possibility of inlining.  \nBecause of all of that, high -performance librari es often come up with custom “throw helpers” they use \nto achieve their goals. Ther', 'e are a variety of patterns for this. Sometimes a library will just define its \nown static method that handles constructing and throwing an exception, and then call sites do t he \ncondition check and delegate to the method if throwing is needed:  \nif (arg is null) \n    ThrowArgumentNullException (nameof(arg)); \n... \n[DoesNotReturn]  \nprivate static void ThrowArgumentNullException (string arg) => \n    throw new ArgumentNullException (arg); \nThis k', 'eeps the IL associated with the throwing out of the calling function, minimizing the impact of \nthe throw. That’s particularly valuable when additional work is needed to construct the exception, e.g.  \nprivate static void ThrowArgumentNullException (string arg) => \n    throw new ArgumentNullException (arg, SR. SomeResourceMessage ); \nOther times, libraries will encapsulate both the checking and throwing. This is exactly what the \nArgumentNullExce', 'ption.ThrowIfNull method that was adde d in .NET 6 does:  \npublic static void ThrowIfNull ([NotNull] object? argument, \n[CallerArgumentExpression ("argument" )] string? paramName = null) \n{ \n    if (argument is null) \n        Throw(paramName);  \n} \n  \n209 CHAPTER 21 | Exceptions  \n [DoesNotReturn]  \ninternal  static void Throw(string? paramName) => throw new \nArgumentNullException (paramName);  \nWith that, callers benefit from the concise call si', 'te:  \npublic void M(string arg) \n{ \n    ArgumentNullException. ThrowIfNull (arg); \n    ... \n} \nthe IL remains concise, and the assembly generated for the JIT will include the streamlined condition \ncheck from the inlined ThrowIfNull  but won’t inline the Throw  helper, resulting in effectively the same \ncode as if you’d written the previously shown manu al version with ThrowArgumentNullException  \nyourself. Nice.  \nWhenever we introduce new publi', 'c APIs in .NET, I’m particularly keen on seeing them used as widely \nas possible. Doing so serves multiple purposes, including helping to validate that the new API is \nusable and fully addresses the intended scenarios, and including the rest of the codebase benefiting \nfrom whatever that API is meant to provide, whether it be a performance improvement or just a \nreduction in routinely written code. In the case of ArgumentN ullException.ThrowIfNul', 'l , however, I \npurposefully put on the brakes. We used it in .NET 6 in several dozen call sites, but primarily just in \nplace of custom ThrowIfNull -like helpers that had sprung up in various libraries around the runtime, \neffectively de duplicating them. What we didn’t do, however, was replace the literally thousands of null \nchecks we have with calls to ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull . Why? Because the new !! C# \nfeature was right around th', 'e corner, destined for C# 11.  \nFor those unaware,  the !! feature enabled putting !! onto parameter names in member signatures, \ne.g. \npublic void Process(string name!!) \n{ \n    ... \n} \nThe C# compiler then compiled that as equivalent to:  \npublic void Process(string name) \n{ \n    ArgumentNullException. ThrowIfNull (name); \n} \n(albeit using its own ThrowIfNull  helper injected as internal into the assembly). Armed with the new \nfeature, dotnet/r', 'untime#64720  and dotnet/runtime#65108  rolled out use of !! across \ndotnet/runtime , replacing ~25,000 lines of code with ~5000 lines that used !!. But, what’s t he line \nfrom Kung Fu Panda, “One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it”? The presence of \nthat initial PR kicked off an unprecedented debate about the !! feature, with many folks liking the \nconcept but a myriad of different opinions about  exactly how it should be e', 'xposed, and in the end, \nthe only common ground was to cut the feature. In response, dotnet/runtime#68178  undid all usage \nof !!, replacing most of it with ArgumentNul lException.ThrowIfNull . There are now ~5000 uses of \nArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull  across dotnet/runtime , making it one of our most popular  \n210 CHAPTER 21 | Exceptions  \n APIs internally. Interestingly, while we expected a peanut -buttery effect of slight perf improvement', 's in \nmany places, our performance auto -analysis system flagged several performance improvements (e.g. \ndotnet/perf -autofiling -issues#3531 ) as stemming from these changes, in particular because it enabled \nthe JIT’s inlining heuristics to flag more methods for inlining.  \nWith the success of ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull  and along with its significant roll -out in \n.NET 7, .NET 7 also sees th e introduction of several more such throw hel', 'pers. dotnet/runtime#61633 , \nfor example, adds an overload of ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull  that works with pointers. \ndotnet/runtime#64357  adds the new ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty  helper as well as \nusing it in several hundred places. And dotnet/runtime#58684  from  \n[@Bibletoon](https://github.com/Bibletoon) adds the new ObjectDisposedException.ThrowIf  helper \n(tweaked by dotnet/runtime#71544  to help ensure it’s inlineable), ', 'which is then used at over a \nhundred additional call sites by dotnet/runtime#71546 .  \n211 CHAPTER 22 | Registry  \n CHAPTER  22 \nRegistry  \nOn Windows, the Registry is a database provided by the OS for applications and the system itself to \nload and store configuration settings. Practically every application accesses the registry. I just tried a \nsimple console app : \nConsole. WriteLine ("Hello, world" ); \nbuilt it as release, and then ran the r', 'esulting .exe. That execution alone triggered 64 RegQueryValue  \noperations (as visible via SysInternals’ Process Monitor  tool). The core .NET libraries even access the \nregistry for a variety of purposes, such as for gathering data for TimeZoneInfo , gathering data for \nvarious calendars like HijriCalendar  and JapaneseCalendar , or for serving up environment var iables \nas part of Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(EnvironmentVariableTarget)  ', 'with \nEnvironmentVariableTarget.User  or EnvironmentVariableTarget.Machine . \nIt’s thus beneficial to streamline access to registry data on Windows, in particular for reducing \noverheads in startup paths where the registry is frequently accessed. dotnet/runtime#66918  does just \nthat. Previously, calling RegistryKey.GetValue  would make a call to RegQueryValueEx  with a null \nbuffer; this tells the RegQueryValueEx  method that the caller wants to', ' know how big a buffer is \nrequired in order to store the value for the key. The imp lementation would then allocate a buffer of \nthe appropriate size and call RegQueryValueEx  again, and for values that are to be returned as strings, \nwould then allocate a string based on the data in that buffer. This PR instead recognizes that the vast \nmajo rity of data returned from calls to the registry is relatively small. It starts with a stackalloc ’d \nbu', 'ffer of 512 bytes, and uses that buffer as part of the initial call to RegQueryValueEx . If the buffer \nwas sufficiently large, we no longer have to make a second system call to retrieve the actual data: we \nalready got it. If the buffer was too small, we rent an ArrayPool  buffer of sufficient size and use that \npooled buffer for the subsequent RegQueryValueEx  call. Except in situations where we actually need \nto return a byte[]  array to the c', 'aller (e.g.  the type of the key is REG_BINARY ), this avoids the need for \nthe allocated byte[] . And for keys that return strings (e.g.  the type of the key is REG_SZ ), previously \nthe old implementation would have allocated a t emporary char[]  to use as the buffer passed to \nRegQueryValueEx , but we can instead just reinterpret cast (e.g. MemoryMarshal.Cast ) the original \nbuffer (whether a stackalloc ’d span or the rented buffer as a Span<c', 'har> ), and use that to construct \nthe resulti ng string.  \nprivate static readonly  RegistryKey s_netFramework = \nRegistry.

It means the developers working on C# don’t need \nto be solely responsible for highlighting every possible thing you might want to diagnose in your \ncode. Instead, library authors can write their own analyzers, ship them either i', 'n dedicated nuget \npackages or as side -by-side in nuget packages with APIs, and those analyzers augment the compiler’s \nown analysis to h elp developers write better code. We ship a large number of analyzer rules in the \n.NET SDK, many of which are focused on performance, and we augment that set with more and more \nanalyzers every release. We also work to apply more and more of those rules aga inst our own \ncodebases in every release. .NET 7 is ', 'no exception.  \nOne of my favorite new analyzers was added in dotnet/roslyn -analyzers#5594  from \n[@NewellClark](https://github.com/N ewellClark) (and tweaked in dotnet/roslyn -analyzers#5972 ). In \nmy .NET 6 performance  post, I t alked about some of the overheads possible when types aren’t sealed:  \n• Virtual calls are more expensive than regular non -virtual invocation and generally can’t be \ninlined, since the JIT doesn’t know what is the ac', 'tual type of the instance and thus the actual  \ntarget of the invocation (at least not without assistance from PGO). But if the JIT can see that a \nvirtual method is being invoked on a sealed type, it can devirtualize the call and potentially even \ninline it.  \n• If a type check (e.g. something is typeof(Som eType) ) is performed where SomeType  is sealed, \nthat check can be implemented along the lines of something is not null && \nsomething.GetTy', 'pe() == typeof(SomeType) . In contrast, if SomeType  is not sealed, the check is \ngoing to be more along the lines of CastHelpers.IsInstanceOfClass(typeof(SomeType), \nsomething) , where IsInstanceOfClass  is a non -trivial (and today non -inlined) call into a JIT \nhelper method in Corelib that not only checks for null and for direct equality with the specified \ntype, but also linearl y walks the parent hierarchy of the type of the object being te', 'sted to see if it \nmight derive from the specified type.  \n• Arrays in .NET are covariant, which means if types B and C both derive from type A, you can have \na variable typed as A[] that’s storing a  B[]. Since C derives from A, it’s valid to treat a C as an A, \nbut if the A[] is actually a B[], storing a C into that array would mean storing a C into a B[], \nwhich is invalid. Thus, every time you store an object reference into an array of refere', 'nce type s, \nadditional validation may need to be performed to ensure the reference being written is \ncompatible with the concrete type of the array in question. But, if A in this example were sealed, \nnothing could derive from it, so storing objects into it doesn’t r equire such covariance checks.  \n• Spans shift this covariance check to their constructor; rather than performing the covariance \ncheck on every write into the array, the check is p', 'erformed when a span is being constructed \nfrom an array, such that if you try to  create a new Span<A>(bArray) , the ctor will throw an \nexception. If A is sealed, the JIT is able to elide such a check as well.   \n214 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n It effectively would be impossible for an analyzer to be able to safely recommend sealing public types. \nAfter all, it has no kno wledge of the type’s purpose, how it’s intended to be used, and whether any', 'one \noutside of the assembly containing the type actually derives from it. But internal and private types are \nanother story. An analyzer can actually see every possible type that cou ld be deriving from a private \ntype, since the analyzer has access to the whole compilation unit containing that type, and it needn’t \nworry about compatibility because anything that could derive from such a type necessarily must also \nbe non -public and would  be r', 'ecompiled right along with the base type. Further, with the exception of \nassemblies annotated as InternalsVisibleTo, an analyzer can have the same insight into internal types. \nThus, this PR adds CA1852, an analyzer that flags in non -InternalsVisibleTo  assemblies all private and \ninternal types that aren’t sealed and that have no types deriving from them and recommends they be \nsealed. (Due to some current limitations in the infrastructure aro', 'und fixers and how this analyzer had \nto be written in order to be able to see all of the types in the assembly, the analyzer for CA1852 \ndoesn’t show up in Visual Studio. It can, however, be applied using the dotnet format  tool. And if \nyou bump up the level of the rule from info to warning or error, it’ll show up as pa rt of builds as well.)  \nIn .NET 6, we sealed over 2300 types, but even with that, this analyzer ended up finding more to seal', '. \ndotnet/runtime#59941  from [@NewellClark](https://github.com/Newell Clark) sealed another ~70 \ntypes, and dotnet/runtime#68268  which enabled the rule as an warning in dotnet/runtime  (which \nbuilds with warning s-as-errors) sealed another ~100 types. As a larger example of the rule in use, \nASP.NET hadn’t done much in the way of sealing types in previous releases, but with CA1852 now in \nthe .NET SDK, dotnet/aspnetcore#41457  enabled the anal', 'yzer and sealed more than ~1100 types.  \nAnother new analyzer, CA1854, was added in dotnet/roslyn -analyzers#4851  from \n[@CollinAlpert](https://github.com/CollinAlpert) and then enabled in dotnet/runtime#70157 . This \nanalyzer looks for the surprisingly common pattern where a Dictionary<TKey, TValue> ’s \nContainsKey  is used to determine whether a dictionary contains a particular entry, and then if it does, \nthe dictionary’s indexer is used to r', 'etrieve the value associated with the key, e.g.  \nif (_dictionary. ContainsKey (key)) \n{ \n    var value = _dictionary[key];  \n    Use(value);  \n} \nDictionary’s TryGetValue  method already combines both of these operations, both looking up the \nkey and retrieving its value if it exists, doing so as a single operation:  \nif (_dictionary. TryGetValue (key, out var value)) \n{ \n     Use(value);  \n} \nA benefit of this, in addition to arguably being sim', 'pler, is that it’s also faster. While Dictionary<TKey, \nTValue>  provides very fast lookups, and while the performance of those lookups has gotten faster \nover time , doing fast work is still more expensive than doing no work, and if we can do one lookup \ninstead of two, that can result in a meaningful performance boost, in particular if it’s being performed \non a fast path. And we can see from this simple benchmark tha t looks up a word in a dic', 'tionary that, \nfor this operation, making distinct calls to ContainsKey  and the indexer does indeed double the cost \nof using the dictionary, almost exactly:   \n215 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n private readonly  Dictionary< string, int> _counts = Regex. Matches( \n    new \nHttpClient ().GetStringAsync ("https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt" ).Result, \n@"\\b\\w+\\b") \n    .Cast<Match>()  \n    .GroupBy(word => word.

It seems \nit’s fairly natural for developers to only call Remove  on a dictionary once they’re sure the dictionary \ncontains the thing being removed; maybe they think Remove  will t hrow an exception if the specified \nkey doesn’t exist. However, Remove  actually allows this as a first -class scenario, with its return Boolean  \nvalue indicating whether the key was in the dictionary (and thus successfully removed) or not. An \nexa', 'mple of this comes from dotnet/runtime#68724 , where CA1853 was enabled for dotnet/runtime. \nThe EventPipeEventDispatcher  type’s RemoveEventListener  method had code like this:  \nif (m_subscriptions. ContainsKey (listener))  \n{ \n    m_subscriptions. Remove(listener);  \n} \nwhich the analyzer flagged and which it’s auto -fixer replaced with just:  \nm_subscriptions. Remove(listener);  \nNice and simple. And faster, since as with the TryGetValue case', ', t his is now doing a single dictionary \nlookup rather than two. :::{custom -style=Figure} \n \n217 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n  ::: \nAnother nice analyzer added in dotnet/roslyn -analyzers#5907  and dotnet/roslyn -analyzers#5910  is \nCA1851, which looks for code that iterates through some kinds of enumerables multiple times. \nEnumerating an enumerator, whether directly or via helper methods like those in LINQ, c an have non -\ntrivial cost. Calling ', 'GetEnumerator typically allocates an enumerator object, and every item yielded \ntypically involves two interface calls, one to MoveNext and one to Current. If something can be done \nvia a single pass over the enumerable rath er than multiple passes, that can save such costs. In some \ncases, seeing places this analyzer fires can also inspire changes that avoid any use of enumerators. For \nexample, dotnet/runtime#6729 2 enabled CA1851 for dotnet/ru', 'ntime , and in doing so, it fixed several \ndiagnostics issued by the analyzer (even in a code base that’s already fairly stringent about \nenumerator and LINQ usage). As an exam ple, this is a function in \nSystem.ComponentModel.Composition that was flagged by the analyzer:  \nprivate void InitializeTypeCatalog (IEnumerable<Type> types)  \n{ \n    foreach (Type type in types) \n    { \n        if (type == null) \n        { \n            throw ExceptionBui', 'lder. CreateContainsNullElement (nameof(types));  \n        } \n        else if (type.Assembly .ReflectionOnly ) \n        { \n            throw new ArgumentException (SR.Format(SR.Argument_ElementReflectionOnlyType , \nnameof(types)), nameof(types));  \n        } \n    } \n \n    _types = types. ToArray(); \n} \nThe method’s purpose is to convert the enumerable into an array to be stored, but also to validate \nthat the contents are all non -null and non -“', 'ReflectionOnly.” To achieve that, the method is first using \na foreach to  iterate through the enumerable, validating each element along the way, and then once \nit’s done so, it calls ToArray() to convert the enumerable into an array. There are multiple problems \n \n218 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n with this. First, it’s incurring the expense of interating through t he enumerable twice, once for the \nforeach and once for the ToArray() , which interna', 'lly needs to enumerate it if it can’t do something \nspecial like cast to ICollection<Type>  and CopyTo  the data out of it. Second, it’s possible the caller’s \nIEnumerable<Type>  changes on each iteration, so any validation done in the first iteration isn’t \nactually ensuring there aren’t nulls in the resulting array, for example. Since the expectation of the \nmethod is that all inputs are valid and we don’t need to optimize for the  failure case', 's, the better \napproach is to first call ToArray()  and then validate the contents of that array, which is exactly what \nthat PR fixes it to do:  \nprivate void InitializeTypeCatalog (IEnumerable<Type> types)  \n{ \n    Type[] arr = types. ToArray(); \n    foreach (Type type in arr) \n    { \n        if (type == null) \n        { \n            throw ExceptionBuilder. CreateContainsNullElement (nameof(types));  \n        } \n \n        if (type.Assembly .Ref', 'lectionOnly ) \n        { \n            throw new ArgumentException (SR.Format(SR.Argument_ElementReflectionOnlyType , \nnameof(types)), nameof(types));  \n        } \n    } \n \n \n    _types = arr;  \n} \nWith that, we only ever iterate it once (and possibly 0 times if ToArray  can special -case it, and bonus, \nwe validate on  the copy rather than on the mutable original.  \nYet another helpful analyzer is the new CA1850 introduced in dotnet/roslyn -analy', 'zers#4797  from \n[@wzchua](https://github.com/wzchua). It u sed to be that if you wanted to cryptographically hash \nsome data in .NET, you would create an instance of a hash algorithm and call its ComputeHash \nmethod, e.g.  \npublic byte[] Hash(byte[] data)  \n{ \n    using (SHA256 h = SHA256. Create()) \n    { \n        return h.ComputeHash (data); \n    } \n} \nHowever, .NET 5 introduced new “one -shot” hashing methods, which obviates the need to creat', 'e a \nnew HashAlgorithm  instance, providing a static method that performs the whole operation.  \npublic byte[] Hash(byte[] data)  \n{ \n    return SHA256.HashData (data); \n} \nCA1850 finds occurrences of the former pattern and recommends changing them to the latter.   \n219 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n The result is not only simpler, it’s also faster:  \nprivate readonly  byte[] _data = RandomNumberGenerator. GetBytes (128); \n \n[Benchmark (Baseline = tru', 'e)] \npublic byte[] Hash1() \n{ \n    using (SHA256 h = SHA256. Create()) \n    { \n        return h.ComputeHash (_data);  \n    } \n} \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic byte[] Hash2() \n{ \n    return SHA256.HashData (_data);  \n} \nMethod  Mean  Ratio  Allocated  Alloc Ratio  \nHash1  1,212.9 ns  1.00 240 B  1.00 \nHash2  950.8 ns  0.78 56 B 0.23 \n \nThe .NET 7 SDK also includes new analyzers around [GeneratedRegex(...)]  (dotnet/runtime#68976 ) \nand the already mentio', 'ned ones for LibraryImport, all of which help to move your code forwards to \nmore modern patterns that have better performance characteristics.  \n \n220 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n  \nThis release also saw dotnet/runtime  turn on a bunch of additional IDEXXXX code style rules and \nmake a huge number of code changes in response. Most of the resulting changes are purely about \nsimplifying the c ode, but in almost every case some portion of the changes ', 'also have a functional and \nperformance impact.  \nLet’s start with IDE0200, which is about removing unnecessary lambdas. Consider a setup like this:  \npublic class C \n{ \n    public void CallSite () => M(i => Work(i)); \n \n    public void M(Action< int> action) { }  \n    private static void Work(int value) { }  \n} \nHere we have a method CallSite  that’s invoking a method M and passing a lambda to it. Method M \naccepts an Action<int> , and the call ', 'site is pass ing a lambda that takes the supplied Int32  and \npasses it off to some static functionality. For this code, the C# compiler is going to generate \nsomething along the lines of this:  \npublic class C \n{ \n    [CompilerGenerated]  \n    private sealed class <>c \n    { \n        public static readonly  <>c <>9 = new <>c(); \n \n        public static Action<int> <>9__0_0; \n \n        internal  void <CallSite> b__0_0(int i) => Work(i); \n    } \n ', '\n    public void CallSite () => M(<>c.<>9__0_0 ??= new \nAction<int>(<>c.<> 9.<CallSite>b__ 0_0)); \n \n    public void M(Action< int> action) { }  \n    private static void Work(int value) { }  \n} \nThe most important aspect of this is that <>9__0_0  field the compiler emitted. That field is a cache for \nthe delegate created in CallSite . The firs t time CallSite  is invoked, it’ll allocate a new delegate for \nthe lambda and store it into that field.', ' For all subsequent invocations, however, it’ll find the field is \n \n221 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n non-null and will just reuse the same delegate. Thus, this lambda only ever results in a single \nallocat ion for the whole process (ignoring any race conditions on the initial lazy initialization such that \nmultiple threads all racing to initialize the field might end up producing a few additional unnecessary \nallocations). It’s important to recogni', 'ze this cach ing only happens because the lambda doesn’t access \nany instance state and doesn’t close over any locals; if it did either of those things, such caching \nwouldn’t happen. Secondarily, it’s interesting to note the pattern the compiler uses for the lambda \nitself. Note that generated <CallSite>b__0_0  method is generated as an instance method, and the \ncall site refers to that method of a singleton instance that’s used to initialize a ', '<>9 field. That’s done \nbecause delegates to static methods use something called a “shuffle thunk” to move arguments into \nthe right place for the target method invocation, making delegates to statics ever so slightly more \nexpensive to invoke than delegates to instance methods.  \nprivate Action _instance = new C().InstanceMethod ; \nprivate Action _static = C. StaticMethod ; \n \n[Benchmark (Baseline = true)] \npublic void InvokeInstance () => _inst', 'ance (); \n \n[Benchmark]  \npublic void InvokeStatic () => _static();     \n \nprivate sealed class C \n{ \n    public static void StaticMethod () { } \n    public void InstanceMethod () { } \n} \nMethod  Mean  Ratio  \nInvokeInstance  0.8858 ns  1.00 \nInvokeStatic  1.3979 ns  1.58 \nSo, the compiler is able to cache references to lambdas, great. What about method groups, i.e.  where \nyou just name the method directly? Previously, if changed my code to:  \np', 'ublic class C \n{ \n    public void CallSite () => M(Work); \n \n    public void M(Action< int> action) { }  \n    private static void Work(int value) { }  \n} \nthe compiler would generate the equivalent of:  \npublic class C \n{ \n    public void CallSite () => M(new Action<int>(Work));  \n \n    public void M(Action< int> action) { }  \n    private static void Work(int value) { }  \n}  \n222 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n which has the unfortunate effect of alloc', 'ating a new delegate on every invocation, even though we’re \nstill dealing with the exact same static method. Thanks to dotnet/roslyn#58288  from \n[@pawche n](https://github.com/pawchen), the compiler will now generate the equivalent of:  \npublic class C \n{ \n    [CompilerGenerated]  \n    private static class <>O \n    { \n        public static Action<int> <0>__Work;  \n    } \n \n    public void CallSite () => M(<>O.<0>__Work ??= new Action<int>(Work)', ');  \n \n    public void M(Action< int> action) { }  \n    private static void Work(int value) { }  \n} \nNote we again have a caching field that’s used to enable allocating the delegate once and caching it. \nThat me ans that places where code was using a lambda to enable this caching can now switch back to \nthe cleaner and simpler method group way of expressing the desired functionality. There is the \ninteresting difference to be cognizant of that si', 'nce we don’t have a lambda which required the \ncompiler emitting a new method for, we’re still creating a delegate directly to the static method. \nHowever, the minor difference in thunk overhead is typically made up for by the fact that we don’t \nhave a second method to invoke; in the common case where the static helper being invoked isn’t \ninlinable (because it’s not super tiny, because it has exception handling, etc.), we previously would \nhave', ' incurred the cost of the delegate invocation plus the non -inlinable method call, and n ow we just \nhave the cost of an ever -so-slightly more expensive delegate invocation; on the whole, it’s typically a \nwash.  \nAnd that brings us to IDE0200, which recognizes lambda expressions that can be removed. \ndotnet/runtime#71011  enabled the analyzer for dotnet/runtime , resulting in more than 100 call sites \nchanging accordingly. However, IDE0200 does', ' more than just this mostly stylistic chang e. It also \nrecognizes some patterns that can make a more substantial impact. Consider this code that was \nchanged as part of that PR:  \nAction disposeAction;  \nIDisposable? disposable = null; \n... \nif (disposable != null) \n{ \n    disposeAction = () => disposable. Dispose(); \n} \nThat delegate closes over the disposable  local, which means this method needs to allocate a display \nclass. But IDE0200 recog', 'nizes that instead of closing over disposable , we can create the delegate \ndirectly to the Dispose method:  \nAction disposeA ction; \nIDisposable? disposable = null; \n... \nif (disposable != null) \n{  \n223 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n     disposeAction = disposable. Dispose; \n} \nWe still get a delegate allocation, but we avoid the display class allocation, and as a bonus we save on \nthe additional metadata required for the  synthesized display class ', 'and method generated for the \nlambda.  \nIDE0020 is another good example of an analyzer that is primarily focused on making code cleaner, \nmore maintainable, more modern, but that can also lead to removing overhead from many different  \nplaces. The analyzer looks for code performing unnecessary duplicative casts and recommends using \nC# pattern matching syntax instead. For example, dotnet/runtime#70523  enabled the analyzer an d \nswitched more tha', 'n 250 locations from code like:  \nif (value is SqlDouble)  \n{ \n    SqlDouble i = (SqlDouble)value;  \n    return CompareTo (i); \n} \nto instead be like:  \nif (value is SqlDouble i)  \n{ \n    return CompareTo (i); \n} \nIn addition to being cleaner, this ends up saving a cast operation, which can add measurable \noverhead if the JIT is unable to remove it:  \nprivate object _value = new List<string>(); \n \n[Benchmark (Baseline = true)] \npublic List<string', '> WithCast () \n{ \n    object value = _value;  \n    return value is List<string> ?

This analyzer typically \nmanifests as rec', 'ommending changing snippets like:  \nreturn _value != null ? _value. Property  : null; \ninto code that’s instead like:   \n224 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n return _value?. Property ; \nNice, concise, and primarily about cleaning up the code and making it simpler and more maintainable \nby utilizing newer C# syntax. However, there is also a small performance advantage in some situations \nas well. For example, conside r this snippet:  \npublic class C \n{ \n', '    private C _value;  \n     \n    public int? Get1() => _value != null ? _value. Prop : null; \n    public int? Get2() => _value?. Prop; \n     \n    public int Prop => 42; \n} \nThe C# compiler lowers these expressions to the equivalent of this:  \npublic Nullable< int> Get1() \n{ \n    if (_value == null) return null; \n    return _value.Prop; \n} \n \npublic Nullable< int> Get2() \n{ \n    C value = _value;  \n    if (value == null) return null; \n    return ', 'value.Prop; \n} \nfor which the JIT then genera tes: \n; Program.Get1()  \n       push      rax  \n       mov       rdx,[rcx+8]  \n       test      rdx,rdx  \n       jne       short M00_L00  \n       xor       eax,eax  \n       add       rsp,8  \n       ret \nM00_L00:  \n       cmp       [rdx],dl  \n       mov       dword ptr [rsp+4] ,2A \n       mov       byte ptr [rsp],1  \n       mov       rax,[rsp]  \n       add       rsp,8  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of cod', 'e 40  \n \n; Program.Get2()  \n       push      rax  \n       mov       rax,[rcx+8]  \n       test      rax,rax  \n       jne       short M00_L00  \n       xor       eax,eax  \n       add       rsp,8  \n       ret \nM00_L00:   \n225 CHAPTER 23 | Analyzers  \n        mov       dword ptr [rsp+4],2A  \n       mov       byte ptr [rsp],1  \n       mov       rax,[rsp]  \n       add       rsp,8  \n       ret \n; Total bytes of code 38  \nNote how the Get1  variant has an', ' extra  cmp instruction ( cmp [rdx],dl ) in the otherwise identical \nassembly to Get2  (other than register selection).

There can be some small \nadditional cost associated with', ' passing addi tional parameters (the overhead of reading the values at \nthe call site, putting them into the right register or stack location, etc., and also the metadata size \nassociated with the additional parameter information), but the larger benefit comes from auditi ng all \nof the cited violations and finding places where work is simply being performed unnecessarily. For \nexample, that PR made some updates to the TimeZoneInfo  type’s implem', 'entation for Unix.
