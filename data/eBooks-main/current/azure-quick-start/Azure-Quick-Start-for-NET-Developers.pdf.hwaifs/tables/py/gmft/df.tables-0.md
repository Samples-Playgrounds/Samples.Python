|  8 | Equally important, when you use cloud resources, you can scale back your             | services and  |
|  9 | resources when there is no longer high demand. This allows you to scale up and       | down          |

| 12 | In addition to massive scalability, off-the-shelf intelligent services, and          | pay-per-use   |
| 13 | efficiency, the cloud offers increased security. The cloud is used by millions of    | people,       |
| 14 | 24x7, worldwide. Of course, it is also attacked by many people. Reputable and        | nan           |
| 15 | experienced cloud providers like Microsoft recognize the usage patterns of           | normal users  |
| 16 | and those of malicious actors. This means we know how to protect against both        | the           |
| 17 | most common and most unique attacks out there. Intelligent monitoring tools,         | machine       |
| 18 | learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence give cloud providers the ability to | detect        |
| 19 | attacks in real time and stop them in their tracks.                                  | nan           |
