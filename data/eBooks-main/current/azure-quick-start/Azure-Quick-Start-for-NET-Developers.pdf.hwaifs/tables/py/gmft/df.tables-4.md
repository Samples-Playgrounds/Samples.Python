|  0 | big data and data analytics. These are not typical stores that you use with your   | nan        |
|  1 | application, but rather stores that you use for data analytics and reporting.      | nan        |
|  2 | Azure provides two data stores that are very suitable for storing large amounts of | data       |
|  3 | for data analytics purposes: the Azure SQL Data Warehouse and the Azure Data       | Lake       |
|  4 | Store.                                                                             | nan        |
|  5 | Each of these can hold petabytes of data. In fact, Azure Data Lake Store doesn’t   | even       |
|  6 | have limits on the amount of data and the file sizes that you can store.           | nan        |
|  7 | You use Azure SQL Data Warehouse when you know the questions that you want         | to         |
|  8 | answer with data analytics. You define a data schema that determines what your     | data       |
|  9 | will look like and how it can be used.                                             | nan        |
| 10 | You use Azure Data Lake Store when you don’t know the questions that you want      | to         |
| 11 | answer yet. You do not have to define a data schema for the Data Lake Store. You   | store      |
| 12 | data in its native format.                                                         | nan        |
| 13 | You can work with each of these data stores with tools in Visual Studio. And you   | can use    |
| 14 | any SQL tool, like SQL Server Management Studio, to work with Azure SQL Data       | nan        |
| 15 | Warehouse. You can even create eye-popping business intelligence dashboards        | and        |
| 16 | reports as a non-developer in Power BI.                                            | nan        |
| 17 | Additionally, you can use the Azure Management SDK for .NET to perform             | management |
| 18 | operations on these services. You can, for instance, create a new Data Lake Store  | nan        |
