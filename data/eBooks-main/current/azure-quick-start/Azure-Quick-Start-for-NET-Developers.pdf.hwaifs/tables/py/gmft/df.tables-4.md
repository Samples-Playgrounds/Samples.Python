|  1 | provides are very storing large for data the Azure SQL Data Warehouse and the Azure Data                                         | Lake       |

|  5 | You use Azure SQL Data Warehouse when know the questions that want                                                               | to         |
|  6 | you you answer with data analytics. You define a data schema that determines what your                                           | data       |
|  7 | will look like and how it can be used.                                                                                           | nan        |
|  8 | You use Azure Data Lake Store when you don’t know the questions that you want                                                    | to         |
|  9 | answer yet. You do not have to define a data schema for the Data Lake Store. You                                                 | store      |
| 10 | data in its native format.                                                                                                       | nan        |
| 11 | You can work with each of these data stores with tools in Visual Studio. And you                                                 | can use    |
| 12 | any SQL tool, like SQL Server Management Studio, to work with Azure SQL Data                                                     | nan        |
