These range from', 'the mundane—such as adding search functionality to your application or spinning up', 'a new SQL database to connect to your recent .NET app—to more exotic projects', 'such as implementing continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)', 'workflows. You also can automatically tune your database or set up push notifications', 'to mobile devices, easily and quickly. These are just a few examples of some common', 'projects that developers have repeatedly had to create for themselves but that are', 'now available as a service. And you can use these services with little effort—almost', 'like flipping a light switch! You can then focus on the pieces of your application that', 'make it unique—the features that provide real added value for your users.', 'Besides services, Azure offers compute resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs),', 'containers, databases, web app services, and mobile services. You can use these to host', 'applications or to provide a complete infrastructure for your users, most of which you', 'can do through Visual Studio.', 'The power of the cloud is that services and resources are incredibly robust and resilient.', 'It is very unlikely that they will fail to run, because the cloud is smart and self-healing.', 'With  Azure,  there  are  datacenters  all  over  the  world,  filled  with  tens  of  thousands  of', 'servers.

You can’t', 'do that with on-premises resources unless you’re prepared to spend enormous sums of', 'money on capital equipment which would remain largely idle and staff to administer it', 'all. You can scale globally without having to build data centers around the world by', 'putting your services anywhere in the world eliminating latency and providing a high-', 'performance experience to your users, regardless of where they are. It also means that', 'you can keep your data where you need it to be, observing data residency', 'requirements.', 'Equally important, when you use cloud resources, you can scale back your services and', 'resources when there is no longer high demand. This allows you to scale up and down', 'even during the course of a normal day keeping applications economical and', 'performant.', 'In addition to massive scalability, off-the-shelf intelligent services, and pay-per-use', 'efficiency, the cloud offers increased security.
