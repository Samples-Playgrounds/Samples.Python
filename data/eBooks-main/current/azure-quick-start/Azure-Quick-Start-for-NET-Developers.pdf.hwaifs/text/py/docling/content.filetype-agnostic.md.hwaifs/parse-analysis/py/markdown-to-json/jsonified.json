There are some obvious differences, like file size limitations and the lack of geo-redundant scaling.

Ideally, you would do these things continuously, whenever somebody commits new work.\n\nAzure DevOps, can help with that. It is an application lifecycle management system that manages your work items and sprints, stores and manages your source code, builds your code, and deploys it to wherever you want. The best part is, it is very easy to set up.\n\nYou can put your source code in DevOps and manage it using the TFS or Git protocols. Once you start committing changes, you can have those built by a simple build pipeline that executes something like a Visual Studio build, just like you would on your local development computer. You can create such a pipeline by just adding tasks in the DevOps portal, like in Figure 9 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverview\n\nBoards\n\nRepos\n\nPipelines da Builds\n\n['Releases']\n\nOI% Library\n\n\u2022 Task groups\n\n** Deployment groups\n\nTest Plans\n\nArtifacts\n\nProject settings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can set your build up to compile your code and run your unit tests every time somebody commits. This is continuous integration.\n\nAnd once the build is done, it can kick off a release pipeline that deploys your code to environments including development, test, staging, and production. You can deploy your code to anywhere: to on-premises resources or to the cloud. You can even have permissions gates that require somebody like a product owner to approve the deployment to production, putting them in control.\n\nYou create a release pipeline in the same way as you create a build pipeline\u2014by adding tasks in the Azure DevOps portal, like in Figure 10 .\n\nDownload and read the free e-book about DevOps for a\n\nAzure DevOps\n\nAzureCamp2019 / Pipelines\n\nGet started with Azure DevOps\n\nFigure 10: Azure DevOps Release Pipeline\n\nAzureCamp2019\n\nA\n\n99\n\n\u2022 Builds\n\nIS Library\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAzure DevOps is a powerful tool that every .NET developer should have in their arsenal.
