<h3>Azure for .NET developers</h3>
<p>If you are a .NET developer or architect who wants to get started with Microsoft Azure,</p>
<p>this book is for you! Written by developers for developers in the .NET ecosystem, this</p>
<p>guide will show you how to get started with Azure and which services you can use to run</p>
<p>your .NET applications and store your data in a more efficient and secure way.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, let’s take a moment to see what the cloud, and Microsoft Azure in</p>
<p>particular, can do for you.</p>
<h4>What can Azure do for you?</h4>
<p>Azure provides services that can help you accomplish many things. These range from</p>
<p>the mundane—such as adding search functionality to your application or spinning up</p>
<p>a new SQL database to connect to your recent .NET app—to more exotic projects</p>
<p>such as implementing continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)</p>
<p>workflows. You also can automatically tune your database or set up push notifications</p>
<p>to mobile devices, easily and quickly. These are just a few examples of some common</p>
<p>projects that developers have repeatedly had to create for themselves but that are</p>
<p>now available as a service. And you can use these services with little effort—almost</p>
<p>like flipping a light switch! You can then focus on the pieces of your application that</p>
<p>make it unique—the features that provide real added value for your users.</p>
<p>Besides services, Azure offers compute resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs),</p>
<p>containers, databases, web app services, and mobile services. You can use these to host</p>
<p>applications or to provide a complete infrastructure for your users, most of which you</p>
<p>can do through Visual Studio.</p>
<p>The power of the cloud is that services and resources are incredibly robust and resilient.</p>
<p>It is very unlikely that they will fail to run, because the cloud is smart and self-healing.</p>
<p>With Azure, there are datacenters all over the world, filled with tens of thousands of</p>
<p>servers. If one server fails, another takes over. If an entire datacenter were to fail (a highly</p>
<p>unlikely scenario), another would take over. All this is possible because of the massive</p>
<p>scale of the cloud.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 5</p>
<p>One of the most compelling arguments in favor of the cloud is that you can scale up</p>
<p>your services and resources almost infinitely, with just a few clicks of a button. You can’t</p>
<p>do that with on-premises resources unless you’re prepared to spend enormous sums of</p>
<p>money on capital equipment which would remain largely idle and staff to administer it</p>
<p>all. You can scale globally without having to build data centers around the world by</p>
<p>putting your services anywhere in the world eliminating latency and providing a high<br />
performance experience to your users, regardless of where they are. It also means that</p>
<p>you can keep your data where you need it to be, observing data residency</p>
<p>requirements.</p>
<p>Equally important, when you use cloud resources, you can scale back your services and</p>
<p>resources when there is no longer high demand. This allows you to scale up and down</p>
<p>even during the course of a normal day keeping applications economical and</p>
<p>performant.</p>
<p>In addition to massive scalability, off-the-shelf intelligent services, and pay-per-use</p>
<p>efficiency, the cloud offers increased security. The cloud is used by millions of people,</p>
<p>24x7, worldwide. Of course, it is also attacked by many people. Reputable and</p>
<p>experienced cloud providers like Microsoft recognize the usage patterns of normal users</p>
<p>and those of malicious actors. This means we know how to protect against both the</p>
<p>most common and most unique attacks out there. Intelligent monitoring tools, machine</p>
<p>learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence give cloud providers the ability to detect</p>
<p>attacks in real time and stop them in their tracks.</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/trusted-cloud/">Decades of experience in security</a> and massive-scale traffic, combined with top industry</p>
<p>security expertise, make the cloud a much more secure environment than any on<br />
premises datacenter.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with Azure services</h3>
<p>Let’s explore some of the services that you can use for running your applications in</p>
<p>Azure, storing your data in Azure, and securing your application with Azure.</p>
<h4>Running your .NET applications in Azure</h4>
<p>One of the first decisions that you need to make when you start with Azure is which</p>
<p>service(s) to use to run your applications in Azure. There are many options. Let’s start by</p>
<p>laying out which Azure services are most suitable for which application types in Table 1.</p>

<h4>Azure App Services</h4>
<p>One of the easiest and most powerful ways to host your applications in Azure is in Azure</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/">App Service. Azure App Service is a group of services that takes care of hosting your</a></p>
<p>application and abstracting away the complexities of the operating system and</p>
<p>infrastructure. They are highly available by default and will stay up and running for at</p>
<p>least <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/app-service/v1_4/">99.95%</a> of the time.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 7</p>
<p>They share powerful features like automatic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and</p>
<p>easy authentication and authorization. They also allow you to debug your application</p>
<p>while it is running in production (with the Snapshot Debugger) and work very well with</p>
<p>Application Insights, which you can use to monitor every aspect of your app, from</p>
<p>performance to usage.</p>
<h4>There are several different types of App Service apps.</h4>
<p><strong>Azure Web Apps</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/">Running a .NET web application in Azure is very easy in Azure Web Apps. Web Apps act</a></p>
<p>as a web server as a service, like <a href="https://www.iis.net/">IIS. And you can simply deploy your ASP.NET or</a></p>
<p>ASP.NET Core application with Visual Studio to Web Apps and run it. These can be</p>
<p>websites, APIs, or any other HTTP-driven application including Node.js, Python and Java</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-scale">Once your application runs in an App Service web app, you can scale it up or down, add</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview">easy authentication, use</a> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-staged-publishing">deployment slots, enable</a> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-continuous-deployment">continuous deployment, and use any</a></p>
<p>of the other App Service features. By default, your application is available on the</p>
<p>internet, without you needing to set up a domain name or configure DNS settings,</p>
<p>although you can do that.</p>
<p><strong>Containers on App Services</strong></p>
<p>Developers who want the power of App Services but need to maintain a higher level of</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/">control over their environments can also run containers. Both Linux and Windows</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container">containers are supported. You can deploy your own containers from the Azure</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/">Container Registry, a private Docker registry or public containers from the Docker Hub.</a></p>
<p>This allows you to run a wide range of pre-configured applications from WordPress to</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-multi-container">Redis which can be deployed either as single containers or as part of a multi-container</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-multi-container">application. Windows container support also helps you migrate existing ASP.NET apps</a></p>
<p>and WCF services that need access to the Windows OS, install custom components, or</p>
<p>use the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 8</p>
<p><strong>Azure Mobile Apps</strong></p>
<p>If you are building mobile applications, you will need a back end that the mobile app</p>
<p>connects to. Usually, this is some sort of API that your app can use to retrieve and store</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/mobile/">data. Azure Mobile Apps</a> provides you with such a back end. You can write it in C# or</p>
<p>use any of the Quickstart applications.</p>
<p>A mobile back end that runs in Azure Mobile Apps provides unique capabilities. For</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-offline-data-sync">instance, you can use offline sync, which enables the mobile app to continue working</a></p>
<p>when there is no connection to the back end and sync changes once the connection is</p>
<p>restored. And with push notifications you can send notifications to the mobile apps</p>
<p>using C# code, regardless of the platform it runs on (iOS, Android, Windows). In addition</p>
<p>to these unique features, Mobile Apps shares all the other features of Azure App Service.</p>
<h4>Azure Functions (also known as serverless compute)</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview">Azure Function apps</a> enable you to create Azure Functions in C# and many other</p>
<p>languages in Visual Studio and other IDEs and editors. Each Functions app contains one</p>
<p>or more Azure Functions and provides integration with authentication and deployment</p>
<p>slots.</p>
<p>The Azure Functions that run in Azure Function apps are small pieces of code that you</p>
<p>write, without you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or about scaling.</p>
<p>Many refer to this deployment model as Functions as a Service (FaaS).</p>
<p>Function applications can be simply triggered by a wide variety of events originating</p>
<p>both inside and outside of Azure. HTTP triggers allow web requests to be served by a</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-grid">function app. Event Grid</a> events can trigger Azure Functions when changes are made to</p>
<p>Azure resources such as the container registry and virtual machines.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 9</p>
<p>Here is an example: You write an Azure Functions app that executes every time a new</p>
<p>image file is uploaded to Azure Storage. You then take that image, rename it, and</p>
<p>output it to another Azure Storage account.</p>
<p>This is very easy to do. You just write the code to rename the image. Azure Functions</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings">takes care of getting the input image when the function is triggered. And it takes care of</a></p>
<p>writing the image to the other storage account. It takes care of all the plumbing, and</p>
<p>you just write the code.</p>
<p>Azure Functions even <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale">handles scaling for you. So it doesn’t matter if there are 1,000</a></p>
<p>images that trigger the function at the same time. Azure Functions transparently spins up</p>
<p>more functions to deal with it and they go away when the code is done executing.</p>
<p>Because of this, you only pay for the code that you execute, not for a service that runs all</p>
<p>the time, waiting to be triggered.</p>
<p>Azure Functions are great for executing small pieces of code that perform one or two</p>
<p>steps on an input and an output. If you want to perform more steps of a larger process,</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview">you can use Durable Functions.</a></p>
<p>Durable Functions provide a stateful experience on top of a series of Azure Functions.</p>
<p>They enable complex patterns such as scatter/gather and function chaining. A Durable</p>
<p>Function orchestration may be as simple as coupling together two functions, one after</p>
<p>another, or as complex as coordinating tens of thousands of function calls over weeks.</p>
<h4>Azure Logic Apps</h4>
<p>Durable Functions are a fantastic orchestration tool for developers who are comfortable</p>
<p>with writing every step of the process inside a series of Functions. For those looking for</p>
<p>a lower code solution Logic Applications may be better. With Azure Logic Apps, you can</p>
<p>orchestrate a process just by weaving API calls together in a visual designer in Visual</p>
<p>Studio or the Azure portal. Visual Studio offers a specific Logic Apps project template to</p>
<p>get started.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 10</p>
<p>A logic app has a trigger, just like an Azure function does. This can be an outside trigger,</p>
<p>like when a new blob is added, or a certain text is tweeted. Or it can be a manual trigger</p>
<p>or a trigger on a schedule such as every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Once triggered, a logic app takes its input and calls APIs with it to complete a process.</p>
<p>You just click this together by choosing APIs from a large list of available ones and</p>
<p>choosing the input and output for those APIs. Azure Functions can also be used for APIs</p>
<p>in a logic app. And you can use your own ASP.NET Core APIs.</p>
<p>Just like Azure functions, logic apps scale automatically, you just create the process. It will trigger as<br />
many times as it is needed and always executes the complete process and has reliability features, like<br />
retry policies, built in. And because it only runs when it is triggered, you only pay for when it runs—you<br />
don’t pay for owning it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions work very well with the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/">Azure Event Grid service. Event Grid allows you to</a><br />
subscribe to events, like when something happens in your application, and to push that information as an event that can<br />
trigger a Logic App or an Azure Function.</p>
<h4>Azure Virtual Machines</h4>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/">A very different way of running your application is by taking advantage of Azure Virtual</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/">Machines. This is an easy way to get started, because you can lift-and-shift existing</a></p>
<p>applications from virtual machines that you run in your datacenter to VMs that run in</p>
<p>Azure. There are many predefined VM images that you can use, like Windows Server</p>
<p>2019 that runs IIS and has ASP.NET installed and preconfigured on it. You can even</p>
<p>bring your own software licenses if you already have one (like for SQL Server).</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 11</p>
<p>Running your application in a VM doesn’t provide you the features like zero-downtime</p>
<p>deployments and easy authentication. You are also responsible for patching the</p>
<p>operating system and for making sure that antivirus software is up to date.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it does provide you with the ability to easily scale your VM to a</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/">bigger size or automatically scale it down when it isn’t used that much. Virtual Machine</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/">Scale Sets allow for scaling out VMs to a large number of nodes and load balancing</a></p>
<p>work between them. And it offers you the reliability of running something in Azure. It is</p>
<p>very unlikely that your VM will stop running, and Microsoft guarantees this uptime with</p>
<p>a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_6/">comprehensive SLA.</a></p>
<p>And if you’re not ready to run your production VMs in Azure you can still take</p>
<p>advantage of streamlined DevOps and testing with Azure DevTest Labs.</p>
<h4>A word about microservices and containers</h4>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/containers/">You can run your applications in containers, which are very lightweight and start and</a></p>
<p>stop in seconds. Containers isolate your application and its dependencies in a way that</p>
<p>guarantees that you’ll never run into library version conflicts. They can be based on</p>
<p>numerous popular Linux distributions or Windows Server so no matter the platform your</p>
<p>application uses it can run in a container.</p>
<p>A popular approach for containers is to use them to run a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices">microservices architecture.</a></p>
<p>This means that you create many small, isolated, services that each have their own</p>
<p>function and each have separate development and deployment lifecycles. Containers</p>
<p>can also be used to lift and shift existing applications to run at scale in the cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices">Azure provides several services to support running a microservices architecture in</a></p>
<p>containers. Running the increasingly popular orchestration engine Kubernetes, Azure</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes">Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides a powerful tool to run anything from a handful of</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-fabric/">containers to hundreds of thousands of them. AKS can all run and orchestrate</a></p>
<p>containers. Orchestration of containers is quite different from orchestrating a process,</p>
<p>like Logic Apps does. Orchestrating containers means that you manage their lifecycles.</p>
<p>Provision new ones, scale up or down, manage failures, and so on.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 12</p>
<h4>Which frameworks and technologies can you use in which Azure service?</h4>
<p>Now that you know what the options are for running your application in Azure, it is</p>
<p>extremely useful to know which version of .NET you can run in these services and what</p>
<p>kind of containers they support. Table 2 explains this by showing which framework and</p>
<p>container types you can use in which services in Azure.</p>

<h4>Azure SQL Database</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-2017">If you are familiar with .NET, you will likely be familiar with SQL Server. In Azure, you can</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/">run your SQL Server workload in Azure SQL Database. This is SQL Server in the cloud. It</a></p>
<p>is the same thing that you run on-premises but it offers a lot of advantages.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-transact-sql-information">You can do (almost)</a> everything with it that you can do with on-premises SQL Server.</p>
<p>And, in fact, new SQL Server features are incorporated in Azure SQL Database first and</p>
<p>later in the on-premises SQL Server.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download?view=sql-server-2017">You can use Azure SQL Databases with your favorite tools, like Azure Data Studio,</a> Server</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-resources-server-explorer-browse-manage">Explorer</a> and <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/ssdt/">SQL Server Data Tools in Visual Studio and SQL Server Management</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms">Studio.</a></p>
<p>Because they run in the cloud, Azure SQL Databases are fully managed, scalable, and</p>
<p>high performing. They are automatically backed up and have many advanced features,</p>
<p>such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-click Geo-replication</strong>, which replicates data to other geographical regions in</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-geo-replication-transact-sql">real time, incredibly easily. (Get started with geo-replication.)</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic data masking</strong>, which masks sensitive data for certain users at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-dynamic-data-masking-get-started">(Get started with dynamic data masking.)</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Auditing</strong>, which provides a complete audit trail of all the actions that happen to the</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auditing">data. (Get started with Azure SQL Database auditing.)</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic database tuning</strong>, which monitors the performance of your database and</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automatic-tuning">tunes it automatically. (Get started with Azure SQL Database automatic tuning.)</a></p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 15</p>
<p>In addition to all these features, Azure SQL Databases are exceptionally reliable by</p>
<p>default. Without configuring anything, transaction log backups are made every 5-10</p>
<p>minutes and differential backups every 12 hours. These backups are stored three times</p>
<p>in the local datacenter and three times in another datacenter. And you can restore</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups#how-long-do-you-keep-my-backups">backups from 35 days ago, depending on the pricing tier</a> that you use.</p>
<p>It is very easy to use Azure SQL Databases from a .NET application. You can, for instance,</p>
<p>use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/">Entity Framework</a> (or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/">Entity Framework Core) to access the database and write</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-connectivity-issues">and read data to and from it. For the most part</a> accessing data programmatically is no</p>
<p>different from accessing data in an on-premises SQL Server.</p>
<h4>Azure Cosmos DB</h4>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/">Azure Cosmos DB</a> is a new kind of database that is globally distributed and cloud native.</p>
<p>Here are some of its key features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/roadmap/azure-cosmos-db-sla-99-999-percent-read-availability-at-global-scale/">A 99.99% SLA</a></strong> <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/roadmap/azure-cosmos-db-sla-99-999-percent-read-availability-at-global-scale/">(99.999% for read operations) that includes low latencies (less than 10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ms on reads; less than 15 ms on writes).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geo-replication</strong>, which replicates data to other geographical regions in real time</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally">(How to distribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB).</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels">Tunable data consistency levels</a></strong> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels">, so you can choose data consistency, enabling a</a></li>
</ul>
<p>truly globally distributed data system. You can, for instance, choose <strong>strong</strong></p>
<p><strong>consistency</strong>, <strong>eventual consistency</strong>, or <strong>session consistency</strong> .</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic management</strong>, which sends users to the data replica to which they are closest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limitless global scale</strong> . You pay only for the throughput and storage that you need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic indexing of data</strong> . No need to maintain or tune the database anymore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to all these features, Cosmos DB offers different APIs with which you can</p>
<p>store and retrieve data, including SQL, Gremlin, MongoDB, Azure Table Storage, and</p>
<p>Apache Cassandra. Different APIs handle data in different ways. You can use documents</p>
<p>as data as well as unstructured tables, graphs, and blobs. You use the API that fits your</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 16</p>
<p>needs, and Cosmos DB takes care of the rest. If your application already uses one of</p>
<p>these protocols switching to Cosmos DB is as simple as changing a connection string.</p>
<p>You benefit from cloud-grade performance, scalability, and reliability, and still use the</p>
<p>programming model to which you’re accustomed.</p>
<p>You can use Cosmos DB from .NET Framework and .NET Core. For example, you can use</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB">its SQL API through the NuGet package Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB</a> or</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core">Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core</a> (for .NET Core).</p>
<h4>Azure Storage</h4>
<p>With <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/">Azure Storage, one of the most fundamental services in Azure, you can store data</a></p>
<p>in different forms. It is easy to use, fast, and inexpensive. Azure Storage offers several</p>
<p>types of storage that you can use for different scenarios. All these storage types share</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption">common features like encryption for data at rest, security through shared access</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1">signatures, and</a> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security">firewalls and virtual networks.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy">Azure Storage is also very reliable. By default, data is replicated three times within the</a></p>
<p>datacenter. You can also choose geo-replicated storage, which, in addition to the three</p>
<p>local replicas, replicates the data three times to another datacenter. You can create your</p>
<p>application in such a manner that it reads from this geo-replicated data, which is close</p>
<p>to your users, so that it is geographically high performing.</p>
<p>You can use Azure Storage from your .NET Framework and .NET Core applications by</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/">using the WindowsAzure.Storage NuGet package and referencing the specific API that</a></p>
<p>you need, like <strong>Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob</strong> (for Blob storage) in a using</p>
<p>statement in your code.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 17</p>
<h4>Let’s explore the different types of Azure Storage:</h4>
<p><strong>File Storage</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/">Azure File storage</a> uses the SMB protocol, which makes it very suitable for lifting and</p>
<p>shifting your file server into the cloud. When you have files in Azure Files, you can mount</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/mount-azure-file-storage">an Azure file share to a VM or even to your own Windows machine, to use as external</a></p>
<p>storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/unmanaged-disks/">Azure Disk Storage is a</a> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-decide-blobs-files-disks">similar service to Azure File but is dedicated to a single machine.</a></p>
<p>It is available in four different performance levels from Standard HDD to Ultra SSD. The</p>
<p>high performance tiers are suitable for heavy I/O workloads such as running SAP HANA</p>
<p>or complex analytical models.</p>
<p><strong>Table Storage</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/tables/">Azure Table storage</a> is an inexpensive and extremely fast NoSQL key-value store that</p>
<p>you can use to store data in flexible tables. A table can contain one row describing an</p>
<p>order and another row describing customer information. You don’t need to define a</p>
<p>data schema. This makes Table Storage very flexible.</p>
<p><strong>Blob Storage</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/">You can use Azure Blob storage to store large unstructured data—literally, blobs of data.</a></p>
<p>This can be video, image, audio, text, or even virtual hard drive (VHD) files for VMs.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers">Blob tiers to reduce your storage costs. By default, blobs are</a></p>
<p>written to the <strong>hot tier</strong>, which means that they are written and read very fast. You can</p>
<p>also put blobs in the <strong>cool tier</strong> if you have data that is infrequently accessed and stored</p>
<p>for at least 30 days. The <strong>cool tier</strong> is less expensive than the <strong>hot tier</strong> . And finally, you can</p>
<p>store blobs in the <strong>archive tier</strong>, that is the least expensive. The <strong>archive tier</strong> is for data</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 18</p>
<p>that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days. Reading data from the archive</p>
<p>tier can take hours. Blob tiering is a great way to save costs if you are storing large</p>
<p>amounts of data.</p>
<p><strong>Queue Storage</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/queues/">Azure Queue storage</a> is an unusual type of storage in that it is used to store small</p>
<p>messages of data, but its main purpose is to serve as a queue. You put messages on the</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/queues/">queue and other processes pick it up. This pattern</a> decouples the message sender from</p>
<p>the message processor and results in performance and reliability benefits. Azure Queue</p>
<p>storage is similar to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms711472(v=vs.85).aspx">Microsoft Message Queuing that you can find in Windows.</a></p>
<p><strong>|Note</strong> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-how-to-use-topics-subscriptions">: Azure Service Bus Topics and Queues also provide queuing mechanisms, with slightly different properties than Azure Storage</a><br />
queues.</p>
<h4>Azure Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB</h4>
<p>As a .NET developer, you encounter many different open-source database types in your</p>
<p>job. Some of them can now be used in a managed version in Azure.</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/mysql/">Azure provides MySQL, PostgreSQL, and</a> <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/mariadb-postgresql-and-mysql-more-choices-on-microsoft-azure/">MariaDB databases as managed databases,</a></p>
<p>which means that you just spin them up and don’t have to worry about any of the</p>
<p>underlying infrastructure. Just like Azure SQL Databases and Cosmos DB, these</p>
<p>databases are universally available, scalable, highly secure, and fully managed.</p>
<p>Each of these is suited for slightly different use cases, but in general, their functionality</p>
<p>overlaps a lot. You would use Azure Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB</p>
<p>when you are already using one of their on-premises versions and want the advantage</p>
<p>of having that run fully managed in the cloud. Migrating apps that use these databases</p>
<p>is much easier when the data can remain in its original platform. Azure also provides an</p>
<p>out of the box backend for services like WordPress which rely on open source databases.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 19</p>
<h4>Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Azure Data Lake Store</h4>
<p>Since we are talking about storing data in Azure, we can’t leave out the data stores for</p>
<p>big data and data analytics. These are not typical stores that you use with your</p>
<p>application, but rather stores that you use for data analytics and reporting.</p>
<p>Azure provides two data stores that are very suitable for storing large amounts of data</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-data-warehouse/">for data analytics purposes: the Azure SQL Data Warehouse</a> and the Azure Data Lake</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-lake-store/">Store.</a></p>
<p>Each of these can hold petabytes of data. In fact, Azure Data Lake Store doesn’t even</p>
<p>have limits on the amount of data and the file sizes that you can store.</p>
<p>You use Azure SQL Data Warehouse when you know the questions that you want to</p>
<p>answer with data analytics. You define a data schema that determines what your data</p>
<p>will look like and how it can be used.</p>
<p>You use Azure Data Lake Store when you don’t know the questions that you want to</p>
<p>answer yet. You do not have to define a data schema for the Data Lake Store. You store</p>
<p>data in its native format.</p>
<p>You can work with each of these data stores with tools in Visual Studio. And you can use</p>
<p>any SQL tool, like SQL Server Management Studio, to work with Azure SQL Data</p>
<p>Warehouse. You can even create eye-popping business intelligence dashboards and</p>
<p><a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">reports as a non-developer in Power BI.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.Azure.Management">Additionally, you can use the Azure Management SDK for .NET</a> to perform management</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-net-sdk">operations on these services. You can, for instance, create a new Data Lake Store</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-net-sdk">account.</a></p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 20</p>
<h3>Securing your .NET applications in Azure</h3>
<p>Besides running your application and storing data, you need to secure it. Azure can help</p>
<p>you with that by providing authentication and authorization through Azure Active</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis">Directory</a> and by helping you to keep secrets safe with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a> and inserting</p>
<p>credentials into your application with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/msi-overview">Managed Service Identity. Let’s examine these</a></p>
<p>services.</p>
<h4>Azure Active Directory</h4>
<p>An important part of your application’s security is authenticating users before they can</p>
<p>use it. Authentication is not an easy thing to implement. You need to store user</p>
<p>identities and credentials, implement password management, create a secure</p>
<p>authentication handshake, and so on.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis">Azure Active Directory</a> provides all these things and more out of the box. You store your</p>
<p>user identities in Azure Active Directory and have users authenticate against it,</p>
<p>redirecting them to your application only after they are authenticated. Azure Active</p>
<p>Directory takes care of password management, including common scenarios like “I</p>
<p>forgot my password.” Azure Active Directory is used by millions of applications every</p>
<p>day, including the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure portal,</a> <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/">Outlook.com, and</a> <a href="https://products.office.com/compare-all-microsoft-office-products">Office 365. Because of this, it is able</a></p>
<p>to more readily detect malicious behavior and act on it. For instance, if a user were to</p>
<p>sign in to an application from a location in Europe and then one minute later sign in</p>
<p>from Australia, Azure Active Directory would flag this as malicious behavior and ask the</p>
<p>user for additional credentials through multifactor authentication.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet">To programmatically talk to Azure Active Directory, you can use the Active Directory</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet">Authenticating Library (ADAL) for .NET Framework and .NET Core.</a></p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 21</p>
<h4>Azure Key Vault</h4>
<p>It is important to keep secrets such as passwords and connection strings out of source</p>
<p>code. So where do you put them? In <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/">Azure Key Vault.</a></p>
<p>Azure Key Vault is a safe place to store passwords, connection strings, access codes,</p>
<p>and certificate keys. It is fully managed by Azure, so you don’t have to worry about</p>
<p>the underlying infrastructure. You just spin it up and use it.</p>
<p>You can use it as a configuration store in your applications, just like you would use a</p>
<p><strong>web.config</strong> file. An administrator can populate the values in the Azure Key Vault, and</p>
<p>your application just pulls it out at startup time or whenever it needs it. This way,</p>
<p>passwords will never be in source code and are the responsibility of the Azure Key Vault</p>
<p>administrator.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault">You can use Azure Key Vault using the Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault NuGet package</a> that</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/simplifying-security-for-serverless-and-web-apps-with-azure-functions-and-app-service/">you can use from the .NET Framework and .NET Core. There is even a special syntax</a></p>
<p>which allows pulling secrets from KeyVault in App Services with zero code changes. For</p>
<p>more complex scenarios where configuration changes based on location, release or</p>
<p><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday/Getting-started-with-Azure-App-Configuration">some other custom dimension Microsoft is introducing Azure App Configuration a</a></p>
<p>service dedicated to providing a centralized configuration location which can be used</p>
<p>from everything form App Services to a DevOps pipeline.</p>
<h4>Managed Service Identity</h4>
<p>Even when you use Azure Key Vault, your application must have some credentials in its</p>
<p>configuration. Something that you use to connect to Azure Active Directory or to Azure</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/msi-overview">Key Vault. Well, it doesn’t have to anymore. You can now use Azure Managed Service</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/msi-overview">Identity.</a></p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 22</p>
<p>You can use Managed Service Identity from a lot of services in Azure, including from</p>
<p>Azure App Service. From there, you can enable it to inject credentials into your</p>
<p>application at runtime and use those credentials to access other services, like Azure Key</p>
<p>Vault.</p>
<p>You can use the Managed Service Identity from the .NET Framework and .NET Core</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication">using the Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication NuGet package.</a></p>
<h4>Azure Advisor</h4>
<p>There are a lot of moving parts in Azure so Microsoft provides a tool called Azure</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/advisor/">Advisor which examines your Azure resources and makes recommendations. The</a></p>
<p>recommendations include how to save money by making more efficient use of Azure</p>
<p>resources and suggestions on how to make your Azure resources more secure. The</p>
<p>security advisor will catch and rank problems like world readable Blob Storage and give</p>
<p>instructions on how to better secure your environment.</p>
<h3>Other Azure services</h3>
<h4>Enhance your application performance</h4>
<p>Azure can also help you to boost your applications’ performance. One service that helps</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache/">with this is Azure Redis Cache, which provides high-performance, in-memory, key-value</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cdn/">storage. Another is Azure Content Delivery Network, or CDN, which can replicate your</a></p>
<p>static content, like images and video files to points-of-presence all over the world,</p>
<p>making sure that it is as close to your users as possible. And finally, Azure Traffic</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager/">Manager</a> can improve application responsiveness by routing users to locations with the</p>
<p>lowest latency.</p>
<h4>Machine Learning</h4>
<p>Azure provides an industry leading suite of services that can make your application more</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/">intelligent. Azure Cognitive Services are a suite of APIs that can do things which would</a></p>
<p>be nearly impossible using traditional programming approaches. You can quickly build</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 23</p>
<p>applications which can recognize faces, convert speech to text and understand the</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/">meaning of text. Using the Language Understanding service you can create bots which</a></p>
<p>can intelligently respond to requests in Slack, Microsoft Teams and other forums.</p>
<p>You can also create your own machine learning algorithms with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/data-science-and-machine-learning">Azure Machine Learning.</a></p>
<p>Training jobs created in popular tools such as Tensorflow can be submitted to run on a</p>
<p>cluster of GPU-enabled Virtual Machines, vastly decreasing the time to train models.</p>
<h4>Internet of Things (IoT)</h4>
<p>When you are building a solution based on the Internet of Things, Azure can help you</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/">with services like Azure IoT Hub, which can ingest massive amounts of messages from</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/suites/iot-suite/">IoT devices and manage the devices. Azure IoT Suite</a> makes it possible for you to</p>
<p>manage your IoT devices without doing everything yourself. And if you have limited IoT</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/iot-central">experience, you can use Azure IoT Central, which is a SaaS solution that enables you to</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-edge/">use IoT with minimal customization. And finally, there is Azure IoT Edge, which allows</a></p>
<p>IoT devices to do some of the calculations locally, instead of having to communicate</p>
<p>with the cloud for every operation. Trained ML models can even be deployed to edge</p>
<p>devices enabling capabilities such as image recognition in disconnected hardware.</p>
<h4>Data Analytics</h4>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory/">There are many services in Azure for doing data analytics, including Azure Data Factory</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/analysis-services/">for moving and transforming data; Azure Analysis Services, which provides an in-</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-lake-analytics/">memory data analytics platform; and Azure Data Lake Analytics, which can perform U-</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-lake-store/">SQL jobs on Azure Data Lake Store. You can also take advantage of Azure Stream</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/">Analytics to analyze data on the fly and Azure Time Series Insights, which provides a</a></p>
<p>unique data analytics platform for time-based data that can store and analyze data and</p>
<p>can show information using its own data visualization engine. In addition, there is Azure</p>
<p><a href="https://databricks.com/azure">Databricks, which offers a managed cluster of enhanced Apache Spark–based analytics</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/">engines, and Azure HDInsight, which you can use to spin up managed clusters of open-</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/storm/apache-storm-overview">source data analytics platforms and tools, like Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, and</a></p>
<p>Apache HBase.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 24</p>
<h4>Messaging</h4>
<p>Azure also provides services that can help you build scalable architectures with events</p>
<p>and messages. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/queues/">Azure Queue Storage and</a> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-how-to-use-topics-subscriptions">Azure Service Bus Topics</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-get-started-with-queues">Queues</a> can help</p>
<p>with that by providing queuing mechanisms that decouple your services. Azure Event</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/">Grid can help by subscribing to events, like blobs being added and pushing an event to</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/">whoever is subscribed to it. And Azure Event Hubs</a> can ingest massive amounts of data,</p>
<p>which you can process, filter, and store in your own time. Using messaging to</p>
<p>communicate between services in Azure allows you to handle load smoothly while also</p>
<p>preventing data loss in the event a service is unavailable.</p>
<h4>Media Services</h4>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/">Working with (streaming) media can be challenging. Azure Media Services can help you</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/encoding/">by providing services like encoding, which encodes your media files into the file formats</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/content-protection/">and screen sizes they need to be. Azure Content Protection</a> enables you to use DRM</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/playready/">technologies like PlayReady</a> to make sure that your content is only used by authorized</p>
<p>users. With <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/media-services-manage-channels-overview">live streaming</a> you can stream media worldwide at massive scale. And by</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/media-analytics/">using Media Analytics</a> you can enhance media by doing intelligent things like creating</p>
<p>subtitles for a movie based on speech.</p>
<h4>Monitoring</h4>
<p>And finally, you need to monitor your applications that run in Azure, to make sure that</p>
<p>they run smoothly. The monitoring tools in Azure fall under the umbrella of Azure</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview">Monitor. There are services like Azure Application Insights</a> that can help you to monitor</p>
<p>every aspect of your application. There is also <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/log-analytics/">Azure Log Analytics, which plugs into</a></p>
<p>every <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/network-watcher/">Azure Service</a> <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/network-watcher/">to gather diagnostics information, and Azure Network Watcher,</a></p>

<h3>Tools for developing, debugging and troubleshooting</h3>
<p>As .NET developers and architects, we are spoiled with the incredible tooling of Visual</p>
<p>Studio. This extends into the world of Azure, which includes many tools that can make</p>
<p>developing and troubleshooting in Azure easier and fun. Let’s explore these tools.</p>
<h4>Visual Studio and Azure</h4>
<p>We all love Visual Studio and Azure does too! If you run any version of Visual Studio</p>
<p>2019 or 2017 and <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/support/selecting-workloads-visual-studio-2017/">enable the Azure workload, you’ll be able to seamlessly work with</a></p>
<p>Azure. And if you can’t upgrade, that’s OK, we have you covered there, too. If you are</p>
<p>using Visual Studio 2015, you can download the Visual Studio 2015 Tools for Azure.</p>
<p><strong>Project templates</strong></p>
<p>Out of the box, you get lots of project templates to work with. You can create web</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cloud-services/">applications for the cloud, Azure Cloud Services applications, Azure Functions, Azure</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-create-web-jobs">WebJobs, and much more.</a></p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 27</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> : Azure project templates in Visual Studio 2019 with Azure workload installed</p>
<h4>Cloud Explorer</h4>
<p>As part of the Azure workload in Visual Studio, you get Cloud Explorer. You can use this</p>
<p>to navigate through all your Azure subscriptions and resources and take action, as in</p>
<p>Figure 3, where you can attach a debugger to an App Service Web App.</p>
<p>From Cloud Explorer, you can also do things like open an Azure SQL Database in the</p>
<p>Visual Studio Server Explorer and upload files to Azure Storage.</p>
<p>You can even connect to services to see their streaming logs and change application</p>
<p>settings and connection strings in App Service.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 28</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong> : Cloud Explorer in Visual Studio</p>
<h4>Publish to Azure</h4>
<p>Once you have the Azure workload enabled in Visual Studio, you can easily publish to</p>
<p>Azure from various project types. The publish wizard has an option to publish to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/">Azure</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/">App Service</a> (for example, host a web site). Or you can directly publish to specific</p>
<p>services like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cloud-services/">Azure Cloud Services. All with a few clicks.</a></p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 29</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4</strong> : Publish to Azure</p>
<p>For a more repeatable process you can set up an Azure DevOps pipeline from inside</p>
<p>Visual Studio 2019 which will build, test, and deploy your application to Azure. The</p>
<p>Pipeline will be kicked off every time there is a check-in to your source control ensuring</p>
<p>your application is always up to date.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 30</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5</strong> : Configure a DevOps Pipeline</p>
<h4>Snapshot Debugger</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/12/06/snapshot-debugging-with-visual-studio-2017-now-ready-for-production/">Snapshot Debugger</a> allows you to debug your application while it is running live in</p>
<p>production, without affecting its performance. This is great, because now you can debug</p>
<p>production without pausing the app when you hit a breakpoint. Debugging provides a</p>
<p>lot more information than diagnostic logs typically do.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 31</p>
<p>Note that you do need Visual Studio Enterprise to use the Snapshot Debugger. Here’s</p>
<p>how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attach the <strong>snapshot debugger</strong> to your application process in Azure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <strong>snappoint</strong> (different from a breakpoint).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the <strong>snappoint</strong> is hit, a <strong>snapshot</strong> is taken.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The debugger quickly gathers all the information it needs about the call stack and</li>
</ul>
<p>variables and lets the app continue to run.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You can now view the <strong>snapshot</strong> and inspect everything that you normally would</li>
</ol>
<p>when debugging, without holding up the application.</p>
<h4>Azure Storage Explorer</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/">Azure Storage Explorer</a> is a tool for managing your Azure Storage accounts. It’s a</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/">free, standalone application from Microsoft that you can download here. You can use it</a></p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/tables/">to create new blob containers, upload files, query through Table storage,</a> and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/storage-explorer">You can even use it to manage your Cosmos DB storage</a> and create databases and</p>
<p>collections.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 32</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6</strong> : Storage Explorer</p>
<h4>Azure Storage Emulator</h4>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/">In the Visual Studio Azure workload or in the Azure SDK, you’ll find the Azure storage</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator">emulator, which you can use to develop locally against Azure Storage. You can access it</a></p>
<p>through Cloud Explorer just like you can access it in the Azure portal or through other</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer">tools such as Storage Explorer.</a></p>
<p>The Azure storage emulator works the same as Azure Storage in the cloud, including</p>
<p>how you authenticate to it. There are some obvious differences, like file size limitations</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/">and the lack of geo-redundant scaling. And the emulator doesn’t support Azure Files.</a></p>
<p>Once you are done developing and testing locally, you can publish your application to</p>
<p>the cloud and use Azure Storage there.</p>
<h4>Azure Command-Line Interface</h4>
<p>You can do everything you need to do in Azure from Visual Studio and the Azure</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.azure.com/">portal. But sometimes you want to run scripts to perform command-level operations,</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/">like when you are working with containers. You can do that using the Azure Command-</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/">Line Interface, or CLI. You can install the Azure CLI on your local development</a></p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 33</p>
<p>computer, use a pre-built Docker container, or use it from within the Azure portal,</p>
<p>where it is a part of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/features/cloud-shell/">Azure Cloud Shell.</a></p>
<p>Using the CLI in the Azure portal through Cloud Shell is very easy. You don’t have to</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli">install anything and you don’t have to log in to your Azure Subscription</a> because you’ve</p>
<p>already done that to get into the portal.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 7</strong> : Azure Cloud Shell in the Azure portal</p>
<p>Azure Cloud Shell supports Bash and PowerShell as scripting languages. These might not</p>
<p>be things that you use daily as a .NET developer, but they are worth diving into because</p>
<p>they are powerful tools.</p>
<p>Once you are in the CLI, you can do anything from listing all the Azure resources you</p>
<p>have to provisioning new resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://shell.azure.com/">You can also access Cloud Shell directly in the browser at https://shell.azure.com or via</a></p>
<p>mobile devices such as iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 34</p>
<h4>Azure Functions Core Tools</h4>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/">Azure Functions</a> run inside Azure App Service Function Apps and are powerful. You can</p>
<p>use them to run small pieces of code that get triggered by outside sources and bind to</p>
<p>things like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/">Azure Blob storage</a> or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/">Azure Cosmos DB.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local">Azure Functions Core Tools</a> enable you to develop Azure Functions locally. You can</p>
<p>run the local version of Azure Functions runtime on your development computer.</p>
<p>With the Azure Functions Core Tools, you can develop and test your Azure Functions</p>
<p>locally. And when you’re done, you can publish them to Azure or use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment">continuous</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment">integration and continuous delivery</a> to check your Azure Functions code and publish it</p>
<p>automatically to Azure.</p>
<h4>Cosmos DB Emulator</h4>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/">When you are using Azure Cosmos DB, you can use the Azure Cosmos DB Emulator to</a></p>
<p>develop locally. The emulator acts just like Cosmos DB would and even provides the</p>
<p>same interface as Cosmos DB does in the Azure portal.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Cosmos DB Emulator local interface</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 35</p>
<p>The Cosmos DB Emulator also shows up in the Cloud Explorer in Visual Studio, so that</p>
<p>you can easily manage it from there.</p>
<p>By developing locally against the Cosmos DB emulator, you can develop without</p>
<p>incurring costs from a Cosmos DB in Azure. And when you are ready, you can deploy</p>
<p>your application to Azure and run it against Cosmos DB there, just by changing your</p>
<p>connection string.</p>
<h4>Azure DevOps for build and deployment</h4>
<p>Once you are working on your application, it is vital to integrate your work with the work</p>
<p>of other developers (continuous integration).</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/">It is vital to deploy that work to a central location, like an Azure Web App, so that you</a></p>
<p>can see that it works, and so that it can be tested and promoted through the different</p>
<p>environments and can be deployed to production (continuous delivery).</p>
<p>To make this work, you need to automatically integrate everybody’s work and deploy it.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would do these things continuously, whenever somebody commits new</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.azure.com/">Azure DevOps, can help with that. It is an application lifecycle management system that</a></p>
<p>manages your work items and sprints, stores and manages your source code, builds</p>
<p>your code, and deploys it to wherever you want. The best part is, it is very easy to set up.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc?view=azure-devops">You can put your source code in DevOps and manage it using the TFS or Git</a> protocols.</p>
<p>Once you start committing changes, you can have those built by a simple build</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/build/visual-studio-build?view=azure-devops">pipeline that executes something like a Visual Studio build, just like you would on your</a></p>
<p>local development computer. You can create such a pipeline by just adding tasks in</p>
<p>the DevOps portal, like in Figure 9.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 36</p>
<p><strong>Figure 9</strong> : DevOps Build Pipeline</p>
<p>You can set your build up to compile your code and run your unit tests every time</p>
<p>somebody commits. This is continuous integration.</p>
<p>And once the build is done, it can kick off a release pipeline that deploys your code to</p>
<p>environments including development, test, staging, and production. You can deploy</p>
<p>your code to anywhere: to on-premises resources or to the cloud. You can even have</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/build-release/concepts/definitions/release/approvals/approvals">permissions gates</a> that require somebody like a product owner to approve the</p>
<p>deployment to production, putting them in control.</p>
<p>You create a release pipeline in the same way as you create a build pipeline—by adding</p>
<p>tasks in the Azure DevOps portal, like in Figure 10.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 37</p>
<p><strong>Figure 10</strong> : Azure DevOps Release Pipeline</p>
<p>Azure DevOps is a powerful tool that every .NET developer should have in their arsenal.</p>
<p>Now you no longer have an excuse to not do continuous integration and continuous</p>
<p>deployment.</p>
<p>Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 38</p>
