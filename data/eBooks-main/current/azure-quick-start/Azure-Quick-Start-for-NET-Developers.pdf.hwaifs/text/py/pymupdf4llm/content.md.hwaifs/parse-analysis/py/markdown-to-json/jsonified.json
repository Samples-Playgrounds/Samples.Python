{"**Azure**": {"Azure for .NET developers": {"What can Azure do for you?": "Azure provides services that can help you accomplish many things. These range from\n\nthe mundane\u2014such as adding search functionality to your application or spinning up\n\na new SQL database to connect to your recent .NET app\u2014to more exotic projects\n\nsuch as implementing continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)\n\nworkflows. You also can automatically tune your database or set up push notifications\n\nto mobile devices, easily and quickly. These are just a few examples of some common\n\nprojects that developers have repeatedly had to create for themselves but that are\n\nnow available as a service. And you can use these services with little effort\u2014almost\n\nlike flipping a light switch! You can then focus on the pieces of your application that\n\nmake it unique\u2014the features that provide real added value for your users.\n\nBesides services, Azure offers compute resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs),\n\ncontainers, databases, web app services, and mobile services. You can use these to host\n\napplications or to provide a complete infrastructure for your users, most of which you\n\ncan do through Visual Studio.\n\nThe power of the cloud is that services and resources are incredibly robust and resilient.\n\nIt is very unlikely that they will fail to run, because the cloud is smart and self-healing.\n\nWith Azure, there are datacenters all over the world, filled with tens of thousands of\n\nservers. If one server fails, another takes over. If an entire datacenter were to fail (a highly\n\nunlikely scenario), another would take over. All this is possible because of the massive\n\nscale of the cloud.\n\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 5\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments in favor of the cloud is that you can scale up\n\nyour services and resources almost infinitely, with just a few clicks of a button. You can\u2019t\n\ndo that with on-premises resources unless you\u2019re prepared to spend enormous sums of\n\nmoney on capital equipment which would remain largely idle and staff to administer it\n\nall. You can scale globally without having to build data centers around the world by\n\nputting your services anywhere in the world eliminating latency and providing a high\nperformance experience to your users, regardless of where they are. It also means that\n\nyou can keep your data where you need it to be, observing data residency\n\nrequirements.\n\nEqually important, when you use cloud resources, you can scale back your services and\n\nresources when there is no longer high demand. This allows you to scale up and down\n\neven during the course of a normal day keeping applications economical and\n\nperformant.\n\nIn addition to massive scalability, off-the-shelf intelligent services, and pay-per-use\n\nefficiency, the cloud offers increased security. The cloud is used by millions of people,\n\n24x7, worldwide. Of course, it is also attacked by many people. Reputable and\n\nexperienced cloud providers like Microsoft recognize the usage patterns of normal users\n\nand those of malicious actors. This means we know how to protect against both the\n\nmost common and most unique attacks out there. Intelligent monitoring tools, machine\n\nlearning algorithms, and artificial intelligence give cloud providers the ability to detect\n\nattacks in real time and stop them in their tracks.\n\n[Decades of experience in security](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/trusted-cloud/) and massive-scale traffic, combined with top industry\n\nsecurity expertise, make the cloud a much more secure environment than any on\npremises datacenter.\n\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 6"}, "Getting Started with Azure services": {"Running your .NET applications in Azure": "One of the first decisions that you need to make when you start with Azure is which\n\nservice(s) to use to run your applications in Azure.

Usually, this is some sort of API that your app can use to retrieve and store\n\n[data. Azure Mobile Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/mobile/) provides you with such a back end. You can write it in C# or\n\nuse any of the Quickstart applications.\n\nA mobile back end that runs in Azure Mobile Apps provides unique capabilities.

Each Functions app contains one\n\nor more Azure Functions and provides integration with authentication and deployment\n\nslots.\n\nThe Azure Functions that run in Azure Function apps are small pieces of code that you\n\nwrite, without you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or about scaling.\n\nMany refer to this deployment model as Functions as a Service (FaaS).\n\nFunction applications can be simply triggered by a wide variety of events originating\n\nboth inside and outside of Azure. HTTP triggers allow web requests to be served by a\n\n[function app. Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-grid) events can trigger Azure Functions when changes are made to\n\nAzure resources such as the container registry and virtual machines.\n\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 9\n\nHere is an example: You write an Azure Functions app that executes every time a new\n\nimage file is uploaded to Azure Storage. You then take that image, rename it, and\n\noutput it to another Azure Storage account.\n\nThis is very easy to do. You just write the code to rename the image. Azure Functions\n\n[takes care of getting the input image when the function is triggered. And it takes care of](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings)\n\nwriting the image to the other storage account.

Azure Functions transparently spins up\n\nmore functions to deal with it and they go away when the code is done executing.\n\nBecause of this, you only pay for the code that you execute, not for a service that runs all\n\nthe time, waiting to be triggered.\n\nAzure Functions are great for executing small pieces of code that perform one or two\n\nsteps on an input and an output. If you want to perform more steps of a larger process,\n\n[you can use Durable Functions.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview)\n\nDurable Functions provide a stateful experience on top of a series of Azure Functions.\n\nThey enable complex patterns such as scatter/gather and function chaining.

Visual Studio offers a specific Logic Apps project template to\n\nget started.\n\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 10\n\nA logic app has a trigger, just like an Azure function does. This can be an outside trigger,\n\nlike when a new blob is added, or a certain text is tweeted. Or it can be a manual trigger\n\nor a trigger on a schedule such as every 15 minutes.\n\nOnce triggered, a logic app takes its input and calls APIs with it to complete a process.\n\nYou just click this together by choosing APIs from a large list of available ones and\n\nchoosing the input and output for those APIs. Azure Functions can also be used for APIs\n\nin a logic app. And you can use your own ASP.NET Core APIs.\n\nJust like Azure functions, logic apps scale automatically, you just create the process.
