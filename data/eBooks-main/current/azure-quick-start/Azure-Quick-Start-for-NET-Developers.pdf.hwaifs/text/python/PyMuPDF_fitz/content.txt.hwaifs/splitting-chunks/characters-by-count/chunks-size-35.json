W\", \"ritten by developers for developers in the .NET ecosystem, this \\nguide will show you how to get star\", \"ted with Azure and which services you can use to run \\nyour .NET applications and store your data in \", \"a more efficient and secure way.  \\nBefore we dive in, let\\u2019s take a moment to see what the cloud, and\", \" Microsoft Azure in \\nparticular, can do for you. \\nWhat can Azure do for you? \\nAzure provides service\", \"s that can help you accomplish many things. These range from \\nthe mundane\\u2014such as adding search func\", \"tionality to your application or spinning up \\na new SQL database to connect to your recent .NET app\\u2014\", \"to more exotic projects \\nsuch as implementing continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment \", \"(CD) \\nworkflows. You also can automatically tune your database or set up push notifications \\nto mobi\", \"le devices, easily and quickly. These are just a few examples of some common \\nprojects that develope\", \"rs have repeatedly had to create for themselves but that are \\nnow available as a service. And you ca\", \"n use these services with little effort\\u2014almost \\nlike flipping a light switch! You can then focus on \", \"the pieces of your application that \\nmake it unique\\u2014the features that provide real added value for y\", \"our users.  \\nBesides services, Azure offers compute resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs),\", \" \\ncontainers, databases, web app services, and mobile services. You can use these to host \\napplicati\", \"ons or to provide a complete infrastructure for your users, most of which you \\ncan do through Visual\", \" Studio.  \\nThe power of the cloud is that services and resources are incredibly robust and resilient\", \". \\nIt is very unlikely that they will fail to run, because the cloud is smart and self-healing. \\nWit\", \"h Azure, there are datacenters all over the world, filled with tens of thousands of \\nservers. If one\", \" server fails, another takes over. If an entire datacenter were to fail (a highly \\nunlikely scenario\", \"), another would take over. All this is possible because of the massive \\nscale of the cloud.  \\n \\nAzu\", \"re Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n6 \\nOne of the most compelling arguments in favor of the cl\", \"oud is that you can scale up \\nyour services and resources almost infinitely, with just a few clicks \", \"of a button. You can\\u2019t \\ndo that with on-premises resources unless you\\u2019re prepared to spend enormous \", \"sums of \\nmoney on capital equipment which would remain largely idle and staff to administer it \\nall.\", \" You can scale globally without having to build data centers around the world by \\nputting your servi\", \"ces anywhere in the world eliminating latency and providing a high-\\nperformance experience to your u\", \"sers, regardless of where they are. It also means that \\nyou can keep your data where you need it to \", \"be, observing data residency \\nrequirements.  \\nEqually important, when you use cloud resources, you c\", \"an scale back your services and \\nresources when there is no longer high demand. This allows you to s\", \"cale up and down \\neven during the course of a normal day keeping applications economical and \\nperfor\", \"mant.  \\nIn addition to massive scalability, off-the-shelf intelligent services, and pay-per-use \\neff\", \"iciency, the cloud offers increased security. The cloud is used by millions of people, \\n24x7, worldw\", \"ide. Of course, it is also attacked by many people. Reputable and \\nexperienced cloud providers like \", \"Microsoft recognize the usage patterns of normal users \\nand those of malicious actors. This means we\", \" know how to protect against both the \\nmost common and most unique attacks out there. Intelligent mo\", \"nitoring tools, machine \\nlearning algorithms, and artificial intelligence give cloud providers the a\", \"bility to detect \\nattacks in real time and stop them in their tracks.  \\nDecades of experience in sec\", \"urity and massive-scale traffic, combined with top industry \\nsecurity expertise, make the cloud a mu\", \"ch more secure environment than any on-\\npremises datacenter.  \\nMore info  \\nTo read more about how Az\", \"ure secures your applications and data,  read the official Azure \\nSecurity blog ,  Azure Security Ov\", \"erview ,  and how to get started with Azure Security .\\nWe\\u2019ve briefly explored reasons to begin your \", \"migration to the cloud and Microsoft Azure.  \\nNow, let\\u2019s examine which Azure services are useful for\", \" you for running and securing your  \\napplications and storing your data. \\nAzure Quick Start Guide fo\", \"r .NET Developers \\n7 \\nGetting Started with Azure services  \\nLet\\u2019s explore some of the services that \", \"you can use for running your applications in \\nAzure, storing your data in Azure, and securing your a\", \"pplication with Azure. \\nRunning your .NET applications in Azure \\nOne of the first decisions that you\", \" need to make when you start with Azure is which \\nservice(s) to use to run your applications in Azur\", \"e. There are many options. Let\\u2019s start by \\nlaying out which Azure services are most suitable for whi\", \"ch application types in Table 1. \\nTable 1: Which Azure services are best suited for which types of a\", \"pplications? \\nApp Service  \\nWeb Apps \\nApp Service \\nMobile \\nApps \\nAzure  \\nFunctions \\nLogic Apps \\nVirt\", \"ual  \\nMachines \\nAzure \\nKubernetes  \\nService (AKS) \\nContainer \\nInstances \\nMonolithic \\nand N-Tier \\napp\", \"lications \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n* \\n \\n \\nMobile app \\nback end \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n* \\n \\n \\nMicroservice \\narchitecture-\\nbased \\nap\", \"plications \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBusiness process \\norchestrations \\nand workflows \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n* For lifti\", \"ng and shifting existing applications to Azure. \\n  \\nAzure App Services \\nOne of the easiest and most \", \"powerful ways to host your applications in Azure is in Azure \\nApp Service. Azure App Service is a gr\", \"oup of services that takes care of hosting your \\napplication and abstracting away the complexities o\", \"f the operating system and \\ninfrastructure. They are highly available by default and will stay up an\", \"d running for at \\nleast 99.95% of the time.  \\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n8 \\nThey s\", \"hare powerful features like automatic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and \\neasy authentication a\", \"nd authorization. They also allow you to debug your application \\nwhile it is running in production (\", \"with the Snapshot Debugger) and work very well with \\nApplication Insights, which you can use to moni\", \"tor every aspect of your app, from \\nperformance to usage.  \\nThere are several different types of App\", \" Service apps.  \\nAzure Web Apps \\nRunning a .NET web application in Azure is very easy in Azure Web A\", \"pps. Web Apps act \\nas a web server as a service, like IIS. And you can simply deploy your ASP.NET or\", \" \\nASP.NET Core application with Visual Studio to Web Apps and run it. These can be \\nwebsites, APIs, \", \"or any other HTTP-driven application including Node.js, Python and Java \\napplications.  \\nOnce your a\", \"pplication runs in an App Service web app, you can scale it up or down, add \\neasy authentication, us\", \"e deployment slots, enable continuous deployment, and use any \\nof the other App Service features. By\", \" default, your application is available on the \\ninternet, without you needing to set up a domain nam\", \"e or configure DNS settings, \\nalthough you can do that.  \\n \\nContainers on App Services \\nDevelopers w\", \"ho want the power of App Services but need to maintain a higher level of \\ncontrol over their environ\", \"ments can also run containers.  Both Linux and Windows \\ncontainers are supported. You can deploy you\", \"r own containers from the Azure \\nContainer Registry, a private Docker registry or public containers \", \"from the Docker Hub. \\nThis allows you to run a wide range of pre-configured applications from WordPr\", \"ess to \\nRedis which can be deployed either as single containers or as part of a multi-container \\napp\", \"lication. Windows container support also helps you migrate existing ASP.NET apps \\nand WCF services t\", \"hat need access to the Windows OS, install custom components, or \\nuse the Global Assembly Cache (GAC\", \").  \\n  \\nTry it now  -  Get started by creating an ASP.NET Core web app in Azure \\nAzure Quick Start G\", \"uide for .NET Developers \\n9 \\n \\nAzure Mobile Apps \\nIf you are building mobile applications, you will \", \"need a back end that the mobile app \\nconnects to. Usually, this is some sort of API that your app ca\", \"n use to retrieve and store \\ndata. Azure Mobile Apps provides you with such a back end. You can writ\", \"e it in C# or \\nuse any of the Quickstart applications.  \\n \\nA mobile back end that runs in Azure Mobi\", \"le Apps provides unique capabilities. For \\ninstance, you can use offline sync, which enables the mob\", \"ile app to continue working \\nwhen there is no connection to the back end and sync changes once the c\", \"onnection is \\nrestored. And with push notifications you can send notifications to the mobile apps \\nu\", \"sing C# code, regardless of the platform it runs on (iOS, Android, Windows). In addition \\nto these u\", \"nique features, Mobile Apps shares all the other features of Azure App Service.  \\n  \\n \\nAzure Functio\", \"ns (also known as serverless compute) \\nAzure Function apps enable you to create Azure Functions in C\", \"# and many other \\nlanguages in Visual Studio and other IDEs and editors. Each Functions app contains\", \" one \\nor more Azure Functions and provides integration with authentication and deployment \\nslots. \\nT\", \"he Azure Functions that run in Azure Function apps are small pieces of code that you \\nwrite, without\", \" you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or about scaling. \\nMany refer to this deplo\", \"yment model as Functions as a Service (FaaS). \\nFunction applications can be simply triggered by a wi\", \"de variety of events originating \\nboth inside and outside of Azure. HTTP triggers allow web requests\", \" to be served by a \\nfunction app. Event Grid events can trigger Azure Functions when changes are mad\", \"e to \\nAzure resources such as the container registry and virtual machines.  \\n  \\nGet started by creat\", \"ing an Android app with an Azure mobile app back end . \\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \", \"\\n10 \\nHere is an example: You write an Azure Functions app that executes every time a new \\nimage file\", \" is uploaded to Azure Storage. You then take that image, rename it, and \\noutput it to another Azure \", \"Storage account.  \\nThis is very easy to do. You just write the code to rename the image. Azure Funct\", \"ions \\ntakes care of getting the input image when the function is triggered. And it takes care of \\nwr\", \"iting the image to the other storage account. It takes care of all the plumbing, and \\nyou just write\", \" the code.  \\nAzure Functions even handles scaling for you. So it doesn\\u2019t matter if there are 1,000 \\n\", \"images that trigger the function at the same time. Azure Functions transparently spins up \\nmore func\", \"tions to deal with it and they go away when the code is done executing. \\nBecause of this, you only p\", \"ay for the code that you execute, not for a service that runs all \\nthe time, waiting to be triggered\", \".  \\n \\nAzure Functions are great for executing small pieces of code that perform one or two \\nsteps on\", \" an input and an output. If you want to perform more steps of a larger process, \\nyou can use Durable\", \" Functions. \\n \\nDurable Functions provide a stateful experience on top of a series of Azure Functions\", \". \\nThey enable complex patterns such as scatter/gather and function chaining. A Durable \\nFunction or\", \"chestration may be as simple as coupling together two functions, one after \\nanother, or as complex a\", \"s coordinating tens of thousands of function calls over weeks. \\n \\nAzure Logic Apps \\nDurable Function\", \"s are a fantastic orchestration tool for developers who are comfortable \\nwith writing every step of \", \"the process inside a series of Functions. For those looking for \\na lower code solution Logic Applica\", \"tions may be better. With Azure Logic Apps, you can \\norchestrate a process just by weaving API calls\", \" together in a visual designer in Visual \\nStudio or the Azure portal. Visual Studio offers a specifi\", \"c Logic Apps project template to \\nget started.  \\n  \\nGet started by creating your first Azure Functio\", \"n with Visual Studio \\n.  \\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n11 \\nA logic app has a trigger\", \", just like an Azure function does. This can be an outside trigger, \\nlike when a new blob is added, \", \"or a certain text is tweeted. Or it can be a manual trigger \\nor a trigger on a schedule such as ever\", \"y 15 minutes.  \\nOnce triggered, a logic app takes its input and calls APIs with it to complete a pro\", \"cess. \\nYou just click this together by choosing APIs from a large list of available ones and \\nchoosi\", \"ng the input and output for those APIs. Azure Functions can also be used for APIs \\nin a logic app. A\", \"nd you can use your own ASP.NET Core APIs.  \\n \\nJust like Azure functions, logic apps scale automatic\", \"ally, you just create the process. It will trigger as \\nmany times as it is needed and always execute\", \"s the complete process and has reliability features, like \\nretry policies, built in. And because it \", \"only runs when it is triggered, you only pay for when it runs\\u2014you \\ndon\\u2019t pay for owning it. \\n \\nNote:\", \" Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions work very well with the Azure Event Grid service. Event Grid a\", \"llows you to \\nsubscribe to events, like when something happens in your application, and to push that\", \" information as an event that can \\ntrigger a Logic App or an Azure Function. \\nAzure Virtual Machines\", \" \\nA very different way of running your application is by taking advantage of Azure Virtual \\nMachines\", \". This is an easy way to get started, because you can lift-and-shift existing \\napplications from vir\", \"tual machines that you run in your datacenter to VMs that run in \\nAzure. There are many predefined V\", \"M images that you can use, like Windows Server \\n2019 that runs IIS and has ASP.NET installed and pre\", \"configured on it. You can even \\nbring your own software licenses if you already have one (like for S\", \"QL Server).  \\n  \\nGet started by building your first logic app workflow in the Azure porta l . \\n \\nHer\", \"e\\u2019s an  example :  \\nA logic app gets triggered by a new blob that is written in  Azure Blob storage \", \". It takes the  \\nBlob input, which is an image file, and resizes the image by calling an Azure funct\", \"ion that  \\ndoes just that. Next, it takes the resized image and writes it to another storage account\", \".  \\nAnd finally, it calls the   Office 365 API   to send an email to the administrator that there is\", \" a  \\nnew, resized image available.   \\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n12 \\nRunning your \", \"application in a VM doesn\\u2019t provide you the features like zero-downtime \\ndeployments and easy authen\", \"tication. You are also responsible for patching the \\noperating system and for making sure that antiv\", \"irus software is up to date.  \\nOn the other hand, it does provide you with the ability to easily sca\", \"le your VM to a \\nbigger size or automatically scale it down when it isn\\u2019t used that much. Virtual Ma\", \"chine \\nScale Sets allow for scaling out VMs to a large number of nodes and load balancing \\nwork betw\", \"een them. And it offers you the reliability of running something in Azure. It is \\nvery unlikely that\", \" your VM will stop running, and Microsoft guarantees this uptime with \\na comprehensive SLA.  \\nAnd if\", \" you\\u2019re not ready to run your production VMs in Azure you can still take \\nadvantage of streamlined D\", \"evOps and testing with Azure DevTest Labs.  \\n \\nA word about microservices and containers \\nYou can ru\", \"n your applications in containers, which are very lightweight and start and \\nstop in seconds. Contai\", \"ners isolate your application and its dependencies in a way that \\nguarantees that you\\u2019ll never run i\", \"nto library version conflicts. They can be based on \\nnumerous popular Linux distributions or Windows\", \" Server so no matter the platform your \\napplication uses it can run in a container.  \\nA popular appr\", \"oach for containers is to use them to run a microservices architecture. \\nThis means that you create \", \"many small, isolated, services that each have their own \\nfunction and each have separate development\", \" and deployment lifecycles. Containers \\ncan also be used to lift and shift existing applications to \", \"run at scale in the cloud. \\nAzure provides several services to support running a microservices archi\", \"tecture in \\ncontainers. Running the increasingly popular orchestration engine Kubernetes, Azure \\nKub\", \"ernetes Service (AKS) provides a powerful tool to run anything from a handful of \\ncontainers to hund\", \"reds of thousands of them. AKS can all run and orchestrate \\ncontainers. Orchestration of containers \", \"is quite different from orchestrating a process, \\nlike Logic Apps does. Orchestrating containers mea\", \"ns that you manage their lifecycles. \\nProvision new ones, scale up or down, manage failures, and so \", \"on.  \\n  \\nGet started by Creating a Windows virtual machine with the Azure portal \\n. \\nAzure Quick Sta\", \"rt Guide for .NET Developers \\n13 \\n \\nWhich frameworks and technologies can you use in which Azure ser\", \"vice? \\nNow that you know what the options are for running your application in Azure, it is \\nextremel\", \"y useful to know which version of .NET you can run in these services and what \\nkind of containers th\", \"ey support.

In Azure, you can \\nrun your SQL Ser\", \"ver workload in Azure SQL Database. This is SQL Server in the cloud. It \\nis the same thing that you \", \"run on-premises but it offers a lot of advantages.  \\nYou can do (almost) everything with it that you\", \" can do with on-premises SQL Server. \\nAnd, in fact, new SQL Server features are incorporated in Azur\", \"e SQL Database first and \\nlater in the on-premises SQL Server.  \\nYou can use Azure SQL Databases wit\", \"h your favorite tools, like Azure Data Studio, Server \\nExplorer and SQL Server Data Tools in Visual \", \"Studio and SQL Server Management \\nStudio.  \\nBecause they run in the cloud, Azure SQL Databases are f\", \"ully managed, scalable, and \\nhigh performing. They are automatically backed up and have many advance\", \"d features, \\nsuch as: \\n\\u2022 Single-click Geo-replication, which replicates data to other geographical r\", \"egions in \\nreal time, incredibly easily.  (Get started with geo-replication.)  \\n\\u2022 Dynamic data maski\", \"ng, which masks sensitive data for certain users at runtime.  \\n(Get started with dynamic data maskin\", \"g.)  \\n\\u2022 Auditing, which provides a complete audit trail of all the actions that happen to the \\ndata.\", \" (Get started with Azure SQL Database auditing.)  \\n\\u2022 Automatic database tuning, which monitors the p\", \"erformance of your database and \\ntunes it automatically. (Get started with Azure SQL Database automa\", \"tic tuning.) \\n  \\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n16 \\nIn addition to all these features,\", \" Azure SQL Databases are exceptionally reliable by \\ndefault. Without configuring anything, transacti\", \"on log backups are made every 5-10 \\nminutes and differential backups every 12 hours. These backups a\", \"re stored three times \\nin the local datacenter and three times in another datacenter. And you can re\", \"store \\nbackups from 35 days ago, depending on the pricing tier that you use. \\nIt is very easy to use\", \" Azure SQL Databases from a .NET application. You can, for instance, \\nuse the Entity Framework (or E\", \"ntity Framework Core) to access the database and write \\nand read data to and from it. For the most p\", \"art accessing data programmatically is no \\ndifferent from accessing data in an on-premises SQL Serve\", \"r. \\n \\n  \\nAzure Cosmos DB \\nAzure Cosmos DB is a new kind of database that is globally distributed and\", \" cloud native. \\nHere are some of its key features:  \\n\\u2022 A 99.99% SLA (99.999% for read operations) th\", \"at includes low latencies (less than 10 \\nms on reads; less than 15 ms on writes).  \\n\\u2022 Geo-replicatio\", \"n, which replicates data to other geographical regions in real time  \\n(How to distribute data global\", \"ly with Azure Cosmos DB).  \\n\\u2022 Tunable data consistency levels, so you can choose data consistency, e\", \"nabling a \\ntruly globally distributed data system. You can, for instance, choose strong \\nconsistency\", \", eventual consistency, or session consistency. \\n\\u2022 Traffic management, which sends users to the data\", \" replica to which they are closest.  \\n\\u2022 Limitless global scale. You pay only for the throughput and \", \"storage that you need.  \\n\\u2022 Automatic indexing of data. No need to maintain or tune the database anym\", \"ore.   \\nIn addition to all these features, Cosmos DB offers different APIs with which you can \\nstore\", \" and retrieve data, including SQL, Gremlin, MongoDB, Azure Table Storage, and \\nApache Cassandra. Dif\", \"ferent APIs handle data in different ways. You can use documents \\nas data as well as unstructured ta\", \"bles, graphs, and blobs. You use the API that fits your \\n  \\nGet started by creating an Azure SQL Dat\", \"abase in the Azure Portal \\n.  \\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n17 \\nneeds, and Cosmos DB\", \" takes care of the rest. If your application already uses one of \\nthese protocols switching to Cosmo\", \"s DB is as simple as changing a connection string. \\nYou benefit from cloud-grade performance, scalab\", \"ility, and reliability, and still use the \\nprogramming model to which you\\u2019re accustomed.  \\nYou can u\", \"se Cosmos DB from .NET Framework and .NET Core. For example, you can use \\nits SQL API through the Nu\", \"Get package Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB or \\nMicrosoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core (for .NET Core).  \\n \\n \\nAz\", \"ure Storage \\nWith Azure Storage, one of the most fundamental services in Azure, you can store data \\n\", \"in different forms. It is easy to use, fast, and inexpensive. Azure Storage offers several \\ntypes of\", \" storage that you can use for different scenarios. All these storage types share \\ncommon features li\", \"ke encryption for data at rest, security through shared access \\nsignatures, and firewalls and virtua\", \"l networks.  \\nAzure Storage is also very reliable. By default, data is replicated three times within\", \" the \\ndatacenter. You can also choose geo-replicated storage, which, in addition to the three \\nlocal\", \" replicas, replicates the data three times to another datacenter. You can create your \\napplication i\", \"n such a manner that it reads from this geo-replicated data, which is close \\nto your users, so that \", \"it is geographically high performing. \\nYou can use Azure Storage from your .NET Framework and .NET C\", \"ore applications by \\nusing the WindowsAzure.Storage NuGet package and referencing the specific API t\", \"hat \\nyou need, like Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob (for Blob storage) in a using \\nstatement in \", \"your code. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nGet started with Azure Cosmos DB with the SQL API and .NET Core \\n. \\nAzure Qu\", \"ick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n18 \\nLet\\u2019s explore the different types of Azure Storage:  \\nFile \", \"Storage \\nAzure File storage uses the SMB protocol, which makes it very suitable for lifting and \\nshi\", \"fting your file server into the cloud. When you have files in Azure Files, you can mount \\nan Azure f\", \"ile share to a VM or even to your own Windows machine, to use as external \\nstorage.  \\n \\nAzure Disk S\", \"torage is a similar service to Azure File but is dedicated to a single machine. \\nIt is available in \", \"four different performance levels from Standard HDD to Ultra SSD. The \\nhigh performance tiers are su\", \"itable for heavy I/O workloads such as running SAP HANA \\nor complex analytical models. \\nTable Storag\", \"e \\nAzure Table storage is an inexpensive and extremely fast NoSQL key-value store that \\nyou can use \", \"to store data in flexible tables. A table can contain one row describing an \\norder and another row d\", \"escribing customer information. You don\\u2019t need to define a \\ndata schema. This makes Table Storage ve\", \"ry flexible. \\n \\nBlob Storage \\nYou can use Azure Blob storage to store large unstructured data\\u2014litera\", \"lly, blobs of data.  \\nThis can be video, image, audio, text, or even virtual hard drive (VHD) files \", \"for VMs. \\nAdditionally, you can use Blob tiers to reduce your storage costs. By default, blobs are \\n\", \"written to the hot tier, which means that they are written and read very fast. You can \\nalso put blo\", \"bs in the cool tier if you have data that is infrequently accessed and stored \\nfor at least 30 days.\", \" The cool tier is less expensive than the hot tier. And finally, you can \\nstore blobs in the archive\", \" tier, that is the least expensive. The archive tier is for data \\n  \\nGet started with Azure Files . \", \" \\n  \\nGet started with Azure Table storage . \\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n19 \\nthat i\", \"s rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days. Reading data from the archive \\ntier can take hou\", \"rs. Blob tiering is a great way to save costs if you are storing large \\namounts of data. \\n \\nQueue St\", \"orage \\nAzure Queue storage is an unusual type of storage in that it is used to store small \\nmessages\", \" of data, but its main purpose is to serve as a queue. You put messages on the \\nqueue and other proc\", \"esses pick it up. This pattern decouples the message sender from \\nthe message processor and results \", \"in performance and reliability benefits. Azure Queue \\nstorage is similar to Microsoft Message Queuin\", \"g that you can find in Windows.  \\n \\n  \\n|Note: Azure Service Bus Topics and Queues also provide queui\", \"ng mechanisms, with slightly different properties than Azure Storage \\nqueues. \\nAzure Databases for M\", \"ySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB \\nAs a .NET developer, you encounter many different open-source databas\", \"e types in your \\njob.
