Written by developers for developers in the .NET eco\", \"system, this \\n\\nguide will show you how to get started with Azure and which services you can use to r\", \"un \\n\\nyour .NET applications and store your data in a more efficient and secure way.  \\n\\nBefore we div\", \"e in, let\\u2019s take a moment to see what the cloud, and Microsoft Azure in \\n\\nparticular, can do for you\", \". \\n\\nWhat can Azure do for you? \\n\\nAzure provides services that can help you accomplish many things. T\", \"hese range from \\n\\nthe mundane\\u2014such as adding search functionality to your application or spinning up\", \" \\n\\na new SQL database to connect to your recent .NET app\\u2014to more exotic projects \\n\\nsuch as implement\", \"ing continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) \\n\\nworkflows. You also can automatical\", \"ly tune your database or set up push notifications \\n\\nto mobile devices, easily and quickly. These ar\", \"e just a few examples of some common \\n\\nprojects that developers have repeatedly had to create for th\", \"emselves but that are \\n\\nnow available as a service. And you can use these services with little effor\", \"t\\u2014almost \\n\\nlike flipping a light switch! You can then focus on the pieces of your application that \\n\", \"\\nmake it unique\\u2014the features that provide real added value for your users.  \\n\\nBesides services, Azur\", \"e offers compute resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs), \\n\\ncontainers, databases, web app s\", \"ervices, and mobile services. You can use these to host \\n\\napplications or to provide a complete infr\", \"astructure for your users, most of which you \\n\\ncan do through Visual Studio.  \\n\\nThe power of the clo\", \"ud is that services and resources are incredibly robust and resilient. \\n\\nIt is very unlikely that th\", \"ey will fail to run, because the cloud is smart and self-healing. \\n\\nWith  Azure,  there  are  datace\", \"nters  all  over  the  world,  filled  with  tens  of  thousands  of \\n\\nservers. If one server fails,\", \" another takes over. If an entire datacenter were to fail (a highly \\n\\nunlikely scenario), another wo\", \"uld take over. All this is possible because of the massive \\n\\nscale of the cloud.  \\n\\nAzure Quick Star\", \"t Guide for .NET Developers \\n\\n5 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\fOne of the most compelling arguments in favor of the cloud \", \"is that you can scale up \\n\\nyour services and resources almost infinitely, with just a few clicks of \", \"a button. You can\\u2019t \\n\\ndo that with on-premises resources unless you\\u2019re prepared to spend enormous su\", \"ms of \\n\\nmoney on capital equipment which would remain largely idle and staff to administer it \\n\\nall.\", \" You can scale globally without having to build data centers around the world by \\n\\nputting your serv\", \"ices anywhere in the world eliminating latency and providing a high-\\n\\nperformance experience to your\", \" users, regardless of where they are. It also means that \\n\\nyou can keep your data where you need it \", \"to be, observing data residency \\n\\nrequirements.  \\n\\nEqually important, when you use cloud resources, \", \"you can scale back your services and \\n\\nresources when there is no longer high demand. This allows yo\", \"u to scale up and down \\n\\neven during the course of a normal day keeping applications economical and \", \"\\n\\nperformant.  \\n\\nIn addition to massive scalability, off-the-shelf intelligent services, and pay-per\", \"-use \\n\\nefficiency, the cloud offers increased security. The cloud is used by millions of people, \\n\\n2\", \"4x7, worldwide. Of course, it is also attacked by many people. Reputable and \\n\\nexperienced cloud pro\", \"viders like Microsoft recognize the usage patterns of normal users \\n\\nand those of malicious actors. \", \"This means we know how to protect against both the \\n\\nmost common and most unique attacks out there. \", \"Intelligent monitoring tools, machine \\n\\nlearning algorithms, and artificial intelligence give cloud \", \"providers the ability to detect \\n\\nattacks in real time and stop them in their tracks.  \\n\\nDecades of \", \"experience in security and massive-scale traffic, combined with top industry \\n\\nsecurity expertise, m\", \"ake the cloud a much more secure environment than any on-\\n\\npremises datacenter.  \\n\\nMore info  \\n\\nTo r\", \"ead more about how Azure secures your applications and data,  read the official Azure \\nSecurity blog\", \" ,  Azure Security Overview ,  and \\nWe\\u2019ve briefly explored reasons to begin your migration to the cl\", \"oud and Microsoft Azure.  \\nNow, let\\u2019s examine which Azure services are useful for you for running an\", \"d securing your  \\n\\nhow to get started with Azure Security \\n. \\n\\napplications and storing your data. \\n\", \"\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n\\n6 \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n\\fGetting Started with Azure services  \\n\", \"Let\\u2019s explore some of the services that you can use for running your applications in \\n\\nAzure, storin\", \"g your data in Azure, and securing your application with Azure. \\n\\nRunning your .NET applications in \", \"Azure \\n\\nOne of the first decisions that you need to make when you start with Azure is which \\n\\nservic\", \"e(s) to use to run your applications in Azure.

Azure App Service\", \" is a group of services that takes care of hosting your \\n\\napplication and abstracting away the compl\", \"exities of the operating system and \\n\\ninfrastructure. They are highly available by default and will \", \"stay up and running for at \\n\\nleast 99.95% of the time.  \\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developer\", \"s \\n\\n7 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n\\fThey share powerful features lik\", \"e automatic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and \\n\\neasy authentication and authorization. They al\", \"so allow you to debug your application \\n\\nwhile it is running in production (with the Snapshot Debugg\", \"er) and work very well with \\n\\nApplication Insights, which you can use to monitor every aspect of you\", \"r app, from \\n\\nperformance to usage.  \\n\\nThere are several different types of App Service apps.  \\n\\nAzu\", \"re Web Apps \\n\\nRunning a .NET web application in Azure is very easy in Azure Web Apps. Web Apps act \\n\", \"\\nas a web server as a service, like IIS. And you can simply deploy your ASP.NET or \\n\\nASP.NET Core ap\", \"plication with Visual Studio to Web Apps and run it. These can be \\n\\nwebsites, APIs, or any other HTT\", \"P-driven application including Node.js, Python and Java \\n\\napplications.  \\n\\nOnce your application run\", \"s in an App Service web app, you can scale it up or down, add \\n\\neasy authentication, use deployment \", \"slots, enable continuous deployment, and use any \\n\\nof the other App Service features. By default, yo\", \"ur application is available on the \\n\\ninternet, without you needing to set up a domain name or config\", \"ure DNS settings, \\n\\nalthough you can do that.  \\n\\nTry it now  -  Get started by creating an ASP.NET C\", \"ore web app in Azure \\n\\nContainers on App Services \\n\\nDevelopers who want the power of App Services bu\", \"t need to maintain a higher level of \\n\\ncontrol over their environments can also run containers.  Bot\", \"h Linux and Windows \\n\\ncontainers are supported. You can deploy your own containers from the Azure \\n\\n\", \"Container Registry, a private Docker registry or public containers from the Docker Hub. \\n\\nThis allow\", \"s you to run a wide range of pre-configured applications from WordPress to \\n\\nRedis which can be depl\", \"oyed either as single containers or as part of a multi-container \\n\\napplication. Windows container su\", \"pport also helps you migrate existing ASP.NET apps \\n\\nand WCF services that need access to the Window\", \"s OS, install custom components, or \\n\\nuse the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).  \\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guid\", \"e for .NET Developers \\n\\n8 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n\\fAzure Mobile Apps \\n\\nIf you are building mobile applications, y\", \"ou will need a back end that the mobile app \\n\\nconnects to. Usually, this is some sort of API that yo\", \"ur app can use to retrieve and store \\n\\ndata. Azure Mobile Apps provides you with such a back end. Yo\", \"u can write it in C# or \\n\\nuse any of the Quickstart applications.  \\n\\nA mobile back end that runs in \", \"Azure Mobile Apps provides unique capabilities. For \\n\\ninstance, you can use offline sync, which enab\", \"les the mobile app to continue working \\n\\nwhen there is no connection to the back end and sync change\", \"s once the connection is \\n\\nrestored. And with push notifications you can send notifications to the m\", \"obile apps \\n\\nusing C# code, regardless of the platform it runs on (iOS, Android, Windows). In additi\", \"on \\n\\nto these unique features, Mobile Apps shares all the other features of Azure App Service.  \\n\\nGe\", \"t started by creating an Android app with an Azure mobile app back end . \\n\\nAzure Functions (also kno\", \"wn as serverless compute) \\n\\nAzure Function apps enable you to create Azure Functions in C# and many \", \"other \\n\\nlanguages in Visual Studio and other IDEs and editors. Each Functions app contains one \\n\\nor \", \"more Azure Functions and provides integration with authentication and deployment \\n\\nslots. \\n\\nThe Azur\", \"e Functions that run in Azure Function apps are small pieces of code that you \\n\\nwrite, without you h\", \"aving to worry about the underlying infrastructure or about scaling. \\n\\nMany refer to this deployment\", \" model as Functions as a Service (FaaS). \\n\\nFunction applications can be simply triggered by a wide v\", \"ariety of events originating \\n\\nboth inside and outside of Azure. HTTP triggers allow web requests to\", \" be served by a \\n\\nfunction app. Event Grid events can trigger Azure Functions when changes are made \", \"to \\n\\nAzure resources such as the container registry and virtual machines.  \\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide\", \" for .NET Developers \\n\\n9 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n\\fHere is an example: You write an Azure Functions app tha\", \"t executes every time a new \\n\\nimage file is uploaded to Azure Storage. You then take that image, ren\", \"ame it, and \\n\\noutput it to another Azure Storage account.  \\n\\nThis is very easy to do. You just write\", \" the code to rename the image. Azure Functions \\n\\ntakes care of getting the input image when the func\", \"tion is triggered. And it takes care of \\n\\nwriting the image to the other storage account. It takes c\", \"are of all the plumbing, and \\n\\nyou just write the code.  \\n\\nAzure  Functions  even  handles  scaling \", \" for  you.  So  it  doesn\\u2019t  matter  if  there  are  1,000 \\n\\nimages that trigger the function at the\", \" same time. Azure Functions transparently spins up \\n\\nmore  functions  to  deal  with  it  and  they \", \" go  away  when  the  code  is  done  executing. \\n\\nBecause of this, you only pay for the code that y\", \"ou execute, not for a service that runs all \\n\\nthe time, waiting to be triggered.  \\n\\nAzure Functions \", \"are great for executing small pieces of code that perform one or two \\n\\nsteps on an input and an outp\", \"ut. If you want to perform more steps of a larger process, \\n\\nyou can use Durable Functions. \\n\\nDurabl\", \"e Functions provide a stateful experience on top of a series of Azure Functions. \\n\\nThey enable compl\", \"ex patterns such as scatter/gather and function chaining. A Durable \\n\\nFunction orchestration may be \", \"as simple as coupling together two functions, one after \\n\\nanother, or as complex as coordinating ten\", \"s of thousands of function calls over weeks. \\n\\nGet started by creating your first Azure Function wit\", \"h Visual Studio .   \\n\\nAzure Logic Apps \\n\\nDurable Functions are a fantastic orchestration tool for de\", \"velopers who are comfortable \\n\\nwith writing every step of the process inside a series of Functions. \", \"For those looking for \\n\\na lower code solution Logic Applications may be better. With Azure Logic App\", \"s, you can \\n\\norchestrate a process just by weaving API calls together in a visual designer in Visual\", \" \\n\\nStudio or the Azure portal. Visual Studio offers a specific Logic Apps project template to \\n\\nget \", \"started.  \\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n\\n10 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n\\fA logic app has a trigg\", \"er, just like an Azure function does. This can be an outside trigger, \\n\\nlike when a new blob is adde\", \"d, or a certain text is tweeted. Or it can be a manual trigger \\n\\nor a trigger on a schedule such as \", \"every 15 minutes.  \\n\\nOnce triggered, a logic app takes its input and calls APIs with it to complete \", \"a process. \\n\\nYou just click this together by choosing APIs from a large list of available ones and \\n\", \"\\nchoosing the input and output for those APIs. Azure Functions can also be used for APIs \\n\\nin a logi\", \"c app. And you can use your own ASP.NET Core APIs.  \\n\\nHere\\u2019s an  example :   \\n\\nA logic app gets trig\", \"gered by a new blob that is written in  Azure Blob storage . It takes the  \\n\\nBlob input, which is an\", \" image file, and resizes the image by calling an Azure function that  \\n\\ndoes just that. Next, it tak\", \"es the resized image and writes it to another storage account.  \\n\\nAnd finally, it calls the   Office\", \" 365 API   to send an email to the administrator that there is a  \\n\\nnew, resized image available.   \", \"\\n\\nJust like Azure functions, logic apps scale automatically, you just create the process. It will tr\", \"igger as \\nmany times as it is needed and always executes the complete process and has reliability fe\", \"atures, like \\nretry policies, built in. And because it only runs when it is triggered, you only pay \", \"for when it runs\\u2014you \\ndon\\u2019t pay for owning it. \\n\\nGet started by building your first logic app workfl\", \"ow in the Azure porta l . \\n\\nNote: Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions work very well with the Azure\", \" Event Grid service. Event Grid allows you to \\nsubscribe to events, like when something happens in y\", \"our application, and to push that information as an event that can \\ntrigger a Logic App or an Azure \", \"Function. \\n\\nAzure Virtual Machines \\n\\nA very different way of running your application is by taking a\", \"dvantage of Azure Virtual \\n\\nMachines. This is an easy way to get started, because you can lift-and-s\", \"hift existing \\n\\napplications from virtual machines that you run in your datacenter to VMs that run i\", \"n \\n\\nAzure. There are many predefined VM images that you can use, like Windows Server \\n\\n2019 that run\", \"s IIS and has ASP.NET installed and preconfigured on it. You can even \\n\\nbring your own software lice\", \"nses if you already have one (like for SQL Server).  \\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n\", \"\\n11 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n\\fRunning your application in a VM doesn\\u2019t provide you the features like zero-dow\", \"ntime \\n\\ndeployments and easy authentication. You are also responsible for patching the \\n\\noperating s\", \"ystem and for making sure that antivirus software is up to date.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, it does provi\", \"de you with the ability to easily scale your VM to a \\n\\nbigger size or automatically scale it down wh\", \"en it isn\\u2019t used that much. Virtual Machine \\n\\nScale Sets allow for scaling out VMs to a large number\", \" of nodes and load balancing \\n\\nwork between them. And it offers you the reliability of running somet\", \"hing in Azure. It is \\n\\nvery unlikely that your VM will stop running, and Microsoft guarantees this u\", \"ptime with \\n\\na comprehensive SLA.  \\n\\nAnd if you\\u2019re not ready to run your production VMs in Azure you\", \" can still take \\n\\nadvantage of streamlined DevOps and testing with Azure DevTest Labs.  \\n\\nGet starte\", \"d by Creating a Windows virtual machine with the Azure portal . \\n\\nA word about microservices and con\", \"tainers \\n\\nYou can run your applications in containers, which are very lightweight and start and \\n\\nst\", \"op in seconds. Containers isolate your application and its dependencies in a way that \\n\\nguarantees t\", \"hat you\\u2019ll never run into library version conflicts. They can be based on \\n\\nnumerous popular Linux d\", \"istributions or Windows Server so no matter the platform your \\n\\napplication uses it can run in a con\", \"tainer.  \\n\\nA popular approach for containers is to use them to run a microservices architecture. \\n\\nT\", \"his means that you create many small, isolated, services that each have their own \\n\\nfunction and eac\", \"h have separate development and deployment lifecycles. Containers \\n\\ncan also be used to lift and shi\", \"ft existing applications to run at scale in the cloud. \\n\\nAzure provides several services to support \", \"running a microservices architecture in \\n\\ncontainers. Running the increasingly popular orchestration\", \" engine Kubernetes, Azure \\n\\nKubernetes Service (AKS) provides a powerful tool to run anything from a\", \" handful of \\n\\ncontainers to hundreds of thousands of them. AKS can all run and orchestrate \\n\\ncontain\", \"ers. Orchestration of containers is quite different from orchestrating a process, \\n\\nlike Logic Apps \", \"does. Orchestrating containers means that you manage their lifecycles. \\n\\nProvision new ones, scale u\", \"p or down, manage failures, and so on.  \\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers \\n\\n12 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \", \" \\n\\fYou can learn more about microservices by reading: \\n\\n.NET Microservices Architecture Guidance \\n\\nW\", \"hich frameworks and technologies can you use in which Azure service? \\n\\nNow that you know what the op\", \"tions are for running your application in Azure, it is \\n\\nextremely useful to know which version of .\", \"NET you can run in these services and what \\n\\nkind of containers they support.
