Wr\", \"itten by developers for developers in the .NET ecosystem, this \\nguide will show you how to get start\", \"ed with Azure and which services you can use to run \\nyour .NET appl ications and store your data in \", \"a more efficient and secure way.  \\nBefore we dive in, let\\u2019s take a moment to see what the cloud, and\", \" Microsoft Azure in \\nparticular, can do for you.  \\nWhat can Azure do for you?  \\nAzure provides servi\", \"ces that can help you accompli sh many things. These range from \\nthe mundane \\u2014such as adding search \", \"functionality to your application or spinning up \\na new SQL database to connect to your recent .NET \", \"app \\u2014to more exotic projects \\nsuch as implementing continuous integrati on (CI) and continuou s depl\", \"oyment (CD) \\nworkflows. You also can automatically tune your database or set up push notifications \\n\", \"to mobile devices, easily and quickly. These are just a few examples of some common \\nprojects that d\", \"evelopers have repeatedly had to  create for themselve s but that are \\nnow available as a service. A\", \"nd you can use these services with little effort \\u2014almost \\nlike flipping a light switch! You can then\", \" focus on the pieces of your application that \\nmake it unique \\u2014the features that provide real a dded\", \" value for your u sers.  \\nBesides services, Azure offers compute resources in the form of virtual ma\", \"chines (VMs), \\ncontainers, databases, web app services, and mobile services. You can use these to ho\", \"st \\napplications or to provide a complete infrastructure  for your users, most  of which you \\ncan do\", \" through Visual Studio.  \\nThe power of the cloud is that services and resources are incredibly robus\", \"t and resilient. \\nIt is very unlikely that they will fail to run, because the cloud is smart and sel\", \"f -healing. \\nWith A zure, there are datac enters all over the world, filled with tens of thousands o\", \"f \\nservers. If one server fails, another takes over. If an entire datacenter were to fail (a highly \", \"\\nunlikely scenario), another would take over. All this is possible because of t he massive \\nscale of\", \" t he cloud.  \\n  \\n Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers  6 One of the most compelling argumen\", \"ts in favor of the cloud is that you can scale up \\nyour services and resources almost infinitely, wi\", \"th just a few clicks of a button. You can\\u2019t \\ndo that with on -premises resources unless you\\u2019 re prep\", \"ared to spend enormous sums of \\nmoney on capital equipment which would remain  largely idle and staf\", \"f to administer it \\nall. You can scale globally  without having to build data centers around the wor\", \"ld  by \\nputting your services anywhere in the world eliminating latency and  provid ing a high -\\nper\", \"formance experience to your users, regardless of where they are. It also means that \\nyou can keep yo\", \"ur data where you need it to be , observing data residency \\nrequirements .  \\nEqually important, when\", \" you use cloud resou rces, you can scale b ack your services and \\nresources when there is no longer \", \"high demand. This allows you to scale up and down \\neven during the course of a normal day keeping ap\", \"plications economical and \\nperformant.  \\nIn addition to massive scalability, off -the-shelf intellig\", \"ent services, and pay -per-use \\nefficiency, the cloud offers increased security. The cloud is used b\", \"y millions of people, \\n24x7, worldwide. Of course, it  is also attacked by many people. Reputable an\", \"d \\nexperienced cloud providers like Microsoft recognize the usage  patterns of normal users \\nand tho\", \"se of malicious actors. This means we know how to protect against both the \\nmost common and most uni\", \"que attacks ou t there. Intelligent monitoring tools, machine \\nlearning algorithms, and artificial i\", \"ntelligence give cloud pro viders the ability to detect \\nattacks in real time and stop them in their\", \" tracks.  \\nDecades of experience in security  and massive -scale traffic, combined with top industry\", \" \\nsecurity expertise, make the cloud a much more secure environment than any on -\\npremises datacente\", \"r.  \\nMore info  \\nTo read more about how Azure secures your applications and data,  \\nread the officia\", \"l Azure  \\n  \\nSecurity blog  \\n,  \\nAzure Security Overview  \\n, \\n and \\n  \\nhow to get started with Azure\", \" Security  \\n. \\nWe\\u2019ve briefly explored reasons to begin your migration to the cloud and Microsoft Azu\", \"re.  \\nNow, let\\u2019s examine which Azure services are useful  for you for running and secur ing your  \\na\", \"pplications and storing your data.   \\n Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers  7 Getting Starte\", \"d with Azure services  \\nLet\\u2019s explore some of the services that you can use for runnin g your applic\", \"ations in \\nAzure, storing your data in Azure, and securing your application with Azure.  \\nRunning yo\", \"ur .NET applications in Azure  \\nOne of the first decisions that you need to make when you start with\", \" Azure is which \\nservice(s) to use to run your ap plications in Azure.

Azure App Servic e is a group of services that takes care of hosting y\", \"our \\napplication and abstracting away the complexities of the operating system and \\ninfrastructure. \", \"They are highly available by default and will stay up and running for at \\nleast 99.95%  of the time.\", \"   \\n Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers  8 They share powerful features like automatic sca \", \"ling, zero -downtime deployments, and \\neasy authentication and authorization. They also allow you to\", \" debug your application \\nwhile it is running in production (with the Snapshot Debugger) and work ver\", \"y well with \\nApplication Insights, which you can use to moni tor every aspect of your app, from \\nper\", \"formance to usage.  \\nThere are several different types of App Service apps.  \\nAzure Web A pps \\nRunni\", \"ng a .NET web application in Azure is very easy in Azure Web Apps . Web Apps act \\nas a web server as\", \" a service, like IIS. And you can simply deploy your A SP.NET or \\nASP.NET Core application with Visu\", \"al Studio to Web Apps and run it. These can be \\nwebsites, APIs, or any other HTTP -driven applicatio\", \"n  including Node.js, Python and Java  \\napplications .  \\nOnce your application runs in an App Servic\", \"e web app, you can scale it up or down , add \\neasy authentication , use deployment slots , enable co\", \"ntinuous deployment , and use any \\nof the other App Service feature s. By default, your application \", \"is available on the \\ninternet, without you needing to set up a domain name or configure DNS settings\", \", \\nalthough you can do that.  \\n \\nContainers on A pp Services  \\nDevelopers who want the power of App \", \"Services but nee d to maintain a higher level of \\ncontrol over their environments can also run conta\", \"iners .  Both Linux  and Windows \\ncontainers  are supported. You can deploy your own containers from\", \" the Azure \\nContainer Registry , a private Docker registry or public containers from the Docker Hub.\", \" \\nThis allows you to run  a wide range of pre -configured applications from WordPress to \\nRedis whic\", \"h can be deployed either as single containers or  as part of a multi -container \\napplication . Windo\", \"ws co ntainer support also helps you migrate existing ASP.NET apps \\nand WCF services that need acces\", \"s to the Windows OS, install custom components, or \\nuse the Global Assembly Cache ( GAC).  \\n  \\n Try \", \"it now  \\n -  \\nGet started by creating an ASP.NET Core  web app in Azure   \\n Azure Quick Start Guide \", \"for .NET Developers  9  \\nAzure Mobile Apps  \\nIf you are building mobile applications, you will need \", \"a back end that the mobile app \\nconnects to. Usually, this is some sort of API that your app can us \", \"e to retrieve and store \\ndata. Azure Mobile Apps  provides you with such a back end.  You can write \", \"it in C# or \\nuse any of the Quickstart applications.  \\n \\nA mobile back end that runs i n Azure Mobil\", \"e Apps provides unique capabilities. For \\ninstance, you can use offline sync , which enables the mob\", \"ile app to continue working \\nwhen there is no connection to the back end and sync change s once the \", \"connection is \\nrestored. And with push notifications you can send notifications to the m obile apps \", \"\\nusing C# code, regardless of the platform it runs on (iOS, Android, Windows). In addition \\nto these\", \" unique features, Mobile Apps shares all the othe r features of Azure App Service.  \\n  \\n \\nAzure Func\", \"tions (also known as serverless compute)  \\nAzure Function apps  enable you to create Azure Functions\", \" in C# and many other \\nlanguages in Visual Studio and other IDEs and editors. Each Functions app con\", \"tains one \\nor more Azure  Functions and provides integration with  authentication and deployment \\nsl\", \"ots.  \\nThe Azure Functions that run in Azure Function apps are small pieces of code t hat you \\nwrite\", \", without you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or about scaling.  \\nMany refer to \", \"this deployment model as Functions as a Service (FaaS).  \\nFunction applications can be simply trigge\", \"red by a wide variety of events originating \\nboth inside and outside of Azure. HTTP triggers allow w\", \"eb requests to be served by a \\nfunction app. Event Grid  events can trigger Azure Functions when cha\", \"nges are made to \\nAzure resources such as the container registry and virtual machines.  \\n  \\n Get sta\", \"rted by creating an Android app with an Azure mobile app back end  \\n.  \\n Azure Quick Start Guide for\", \" .NET Developers  10 Here is an example : You write an Azure Functions app that executes every time \", \"a new \\nimage file is uploaded to Azure Storage. You then take that image, rename it, and \\noutput i t\", \" to another Azure Storage account.  \\nThis is very easy to do. You just write the code to rename the \", \"image. Azure Functions \\ntakes care of getting the input image when the function is triggered . And i\", \"t takes care of \\nwriting the image to the other storage account. It takes care of all the plumbing, \", \"and \\nyou just write the code.  \\nAzure Functions even handles scaling for you . So it doesn\\u2019t matter \", \"if there are 1 ,000 \\nimages that trigger the function at the same time. Azure Functions transparentl\", \"y spins up \\nmore functions to deal with it and they go away when the code is done executing. \\nBecaus\", \"e of this, you only pay for the code that you execute, not for a service t hat runs all \\nthe time, w\", \"aiting to be triggered.  \\n \\nAzure Functions are great for executing small piec es of code that perfo\", \"rm one or two \\nsteps on an input and an output. If you want to perform more steps of a larger proces\", \"s, \\nyou can use Durable Function s. \\n \\nDurable Functions provide a stateful experience on top of a s\", \"eries of Azure Functions. \\nThey enable complex patterns such as scatter/gather and function chaining\", \". A Durable \\nFunction orchestration may be as simple as coupling together two functions, one  after \", \"\\nanother, or as complex as coordinating tens of thousands of function calls over weeks.  \\n \\nAzure Lo\", \"gic Apps  \\nDurable Functions are a fantastic orchestration tool for developers who are comfortable \\n\", \"with writing every step of the process inside a series of Functions. For those looking for \\na lower \", \"code solution Logic Applications may be better.  With Azure Logic Apps, you can \\norchestrate a proce\", \"ss just by weaving API calls together in a visual designer in Visual \\nStudio or the Azure portal. Vi\", \"sual Studio off ers a specific Logic Apps project temp late to \\nget started.  \\n  \\n Get started by cr\", \"eating your first Azure Function with Visual Studi o \\n. \\n   \\n Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Devel\", \"opers  11 A logic app has a trigger, just like an Azure function does. This can be an outside trigge\", \"r, \\nlike when a new blob is added, or a certain text is tweeted. Or it can be a manual trigger \\nor a\", \" trigger  on a schedule such as every 15 minute s.  \\nOnce triggered, a logic app takes its input and\", \" calls APIs with it to complete a process. \\nYou just click this together by choosing APIs from a lar\", \"ge list of available ones and \\nchoosing the input and output for tho se APIs. Azure Functions can al\", \"so be used for APIs \\nin a logic app. And you can use your own ASP.NET Core APIs.  \\n \\nJust like Azure\", \" functions, logic apps scale automatically, you just create the process. It will trigger as \\nmany ti\", \"mes as it is needed and alway s executes the complete process and has reliability features, like \\nre\", \"try policies, built in. And because it only runs when it is triggered, you only pay for when it runs\", \" \\u2014you \\ndon\\u2019t pay for owning it.  \\n \\nNote:  Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions work very we ll with\", \" the  Azure Event Grid  service. Event Grid allows you to \\nsubscribe to events, like when something \", \"happens in your application, and to push that information as an event that can \\ntrigger a Logic App \", \"or an Azure Function.  \\nAzure Virtual Machines  \\nA very different way of running your application is\", \" by taking advantage of Azure Virtual \\nMachines . This is an easy way to get started, because you ca\", \"n lift -and-shift existing \\napplications from virtual machines that you run in your datacenter to VM\", \"s that run in \\nAzure. There are many predefined VM images that you can use, like Windows Server \\n201\", \"9 that runs IIS and has ASP.NET installed and preconfigured on it. You ca n even \\nbring your own sof\", \"tware licenses if you already have one (like for SQL Server).  \\n  \\n Get started by building your fir\", \"st logic app workflow in the Azure porta  \\nl \\n. \\n  \\nHere\\u2019s an   \\nexample  \\n: \\n  \\nA logic app gets tr\", \"iggered by a new blob that is written in  \\nAzure Blob storag e \\n. It takes  the  \\nBlob input, which \", \"is an image file, and resizes the image by calling an Azure function that  \\ndoes just that. Next, it\", \" takes the resized image and writes it to another storage account.  \\nAnd finally, it calls the    \\nO\", \"ffice 365 AP I \\n  \\nto send an email to the administrator that there is a  \\nnew, res ized image avail\", \"able.  \\n   \\n Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers  12 Running your application in a VM doesn\\u2019\", \"t provide you the features like zero-downtime \\ndeployments and easy authentication. You are also res\", \"ponsible for patching the \\noperating system and for making sure that antivirus software is up to dat\", \"e.   \\nOn the other hand, it does provide you with the ability to easily scale your VM to a \\nbigger s\", \"ize or automatically scale it down when it isn\\u2019t used that much. Virtual Machine \\nScale Sets  allow \", \"for scaling out VMs to a large number of nodes and load balancing \\nwork between them. And it offers \", \"you the reliability of running something in Azure. It is \\nvery unli kely that your VM will stop runn\", \"ing, and Microsoft guarantees this uptime with \\na comprehensive SLA .  \\nAnd if you\\u2019re not ready to r\", \"un your production VMs in Azure you can  still take \\nadvantage of streamlined DevOps and testing wit\", \"h Azure DevTest Labs.  \\n \\nA word about microservices and containers  \\nYou can run your applications \", \"in containers , which are very lightweight and start and \\nstop in seconds.  Containers isolate your \", \"application and its dependencies in  a way that \\nguarantees that you\\u2019ll never run into library versi\", \"on conflicts. They can be  based on \\nnumerous popular Linux distributions or Windows Server so no ma\", \"tter the platform you r \\napplication uses  it can run in a container.  \\nA popular approach for cont \", \"ainer s is to use them to run a microservices architecture . \\nThis means that you create many small \", \", isolated,  services that each have th eir own \\nfunction and each have separate development  and de\", \"ployment lifecycles. Containers \\ncan also be used to lift and shift existing applications to run at \", \"scale in the cloud.  \\nAzure provides several services to support running a  microservices architectu\", \"re in \\ncontainers. Running the increasingly popular orchestrati on engine Kubernetes , Azure \\nKubern\", \"etes  Service  (AKS) provides a powerful tool to run anything from  a handful of \\ncontainers to hund\", \"reds of thousands of them . AKS can all  run and orchestrate \\ncontainers . Orchestration of containe\", \"rs is quite different from orchestrating a process , \\nlike Logic Apps does. Orchestrating containers\", \" means that you manage their lifecycles. \\nProvision new ones, scale up or down, manage failures, and\", \" so on.   \\n  \\n Get started by Creating a Windows virtual machine with the Azure portal  \\n.  \\n Azure \", \"Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers  13  \\nWhich frameworks and technologies can you use in which A\", \"zure service?  \\nNow that you know what the options are for running your application in Azure, it is \", \"\\nextremely useful to know which ver sion of .NET you can run in these services and what \\nkind of con\", \"tainers they support.
