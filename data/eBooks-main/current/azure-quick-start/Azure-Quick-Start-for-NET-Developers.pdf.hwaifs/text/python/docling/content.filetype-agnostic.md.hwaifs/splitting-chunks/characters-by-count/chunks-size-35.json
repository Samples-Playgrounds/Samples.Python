Written by developers for developers in the .NET ecosystem, this guide will show\", \" you how to get started with Azure and which services you can use to run your .NET applications and \", \"store your data in a more efficient and secure way.\\n\\nBefore we dive in, let's take a moment to see w\", \"hat the cloud, and Microsoft Azure in particular, can do for you.\\n\\n## What can Azure do for you?\\n\\nAz\", \"ure provides services that can help you accomplish many things. These range from the mundane \\u2014 such \", \"as adding search functionality to your application or spinning up a new SQL database to connect to y\", \"our recent .NET app\\u2014to more exotic projects such as implementing continuous integration (CI) and con\", \"tinuous deployment (CD) workflows. You also can automatically tune your database or set up push noti\", \"fications to mobile devices, easily and quickly. These are just a few examples of some common projec\", \"ts that developers have repeatedly had to create for themselves but that are now available as a serv\", \"ice. And you can use these services with little effort\\u2014almost like flipping a light switch! You can \", \"then focus on the pieces of your application that make it unique\\u2014the features that provide real adde\", \"d value for your users.\\n\\nBesides services, Azure offers compute resources in the form of virtual mac\", \"hines (VMs), containers, databases, web app services, and mobile services. You can use these to host\", \" applications or to provide a complete infrastructure for your users, most of which you can do throu\", \"gh Visual Studio.\\n\\nThe power of the cloud is that services and resources are incredibly robust and r\", \"esilient. It is very unlikely that they will fail to run, because the cloud is smart and self-healin\", \"g. With Azure, there are datacenters all over the world, filled with tens of thousands of servers. I\", \"f one server fails, another takes over. If an entire datacenter were to fail (a highly unlikely scen\", \"ario), another would take over. All this is possible because of the massive scale of the cloud.\\n\\n<!-\", \"- image -->\\n\\nMore info\\n\\nOne of the most compelling arguments in favor of the cloud is that you can s\", \"cale up your services and resources almost infinitely, with just a few clicks of a button. You can't\", \" do that with on -premises resources unless you're prepared to spend enormous sums of money on capit\", \"al equipment which would remain largely idle and staff to administer it all. You can scale globally \", \"without having to build data centers around the world by putting your services anywhere in the world\", \" eliminating latency and providing a highperformance experience to your users, regardless of where t\", \"hey are. It also means that you can keep your data where you need it to be, observing data residency\", \" requirements .\\n\\nEqually important, when you use cloud resources, you can scale back your services a\", \"nd resources when there is no longer high demand. This allows you to scale up and down even during t\", \"he course of a normal day keeping applications economical and performant.\\n\\nIn addition to massive sc\", \"alability, off-the-shelf intelligent services, and pay-per-use efficiency, the cloud offers increase\", \"d security. The cloud is used by millions of people, 24x7, worldwide. Of course, it is also attacked\", \" by many people. Reputable and experienced cloud providers like Microsoft recognize the usage patter\", \"ns of normal users and those of malicious actors. This means we know how to protect against both the\", \" most common and most unique attacks out there. Intelligent monitoring tools, machine learning algor\", \"ithms, and artificial intelligence give cloud providers the ability to detect attacks in real time a\", \"nd stop them in their tracks.\\n\\nDecades of experience in security and massive-scale traffic, combined\", \" with top industry security expertise, make the cloud a much more secure environment than any onprem\", \"ises datacenter.\\n\\n## More info\\n\\nTo read more about how Azure secures your applications and data, rea\", \"d the official Azure Security blog , Azure Security Overview, w, and how to get started with Azure S\", \"ecurity . We've briefly explored reasons to begin your migration to the cloud and Microsoft Azure. N\", \"ow, let's examine which Azure services are useful for you for running and securing your applications\", \" and storing your data.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Getting Started with Azure services\\n\\nLet\", \"'s explore some of the services that you can use for running your applications in Azure, storing you\", \"r data in Azure, and securing your application with Azure.\\n\\n## Running your .NET applications in Azu\", \"re\\n\\nOne of the first decisions that you need to make when you start with Azure is which service(s) t\", \"o use to run your applications in Azure. There are many options. Let's start by laying out which Azu\", \"re services are most suitable for which application types in Table 1.\\n\\nTable 1: Which Azure services\", \" are best suited for which types of applications?\\n\\n|                                                \", \" | App Service  Web Apps   | App Service  Mobile  Apps   | Azure  Functions   | Logic Apps   | Virtu\", \"al  Machines   | Azure  Kubernetes Service (AKS)   | Container  Instances   |\\n|---------------------\", \"----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------\", \"-----|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------\", \"---|\\n| Monolithic  and N - Tier  applications          |                         |                  \", \"           |                    |              | *                   |                              \", \"     |                        |\\n| Mobile app  back end                            |                 \", \"        |                             |                    |              | *                   |   \", \"                                |                        |\\n| Microservice  architecture \\u0002 based appl\", \"ications |                         |                             |                    |             \", \" |                     |                                   |                        |\\n| Business pro\", \"cess  orchestrations  and workflows |                         |                             |       \", \"             |              |                     |                                   |             \", \"           |\\n\\n* For lifting and shifting existing applications to Azure .\\n\\n## Azure App Services\\n\\nOn\", \"e of the easiest and most powerful ways to host your applications in Azure is in Azure App Service .\", \" Azure App Service is a group of services that takes care of hosting your application and abstractin\", \"g away the complexities of the operating system and infrastructure. They are highly available by def\", \"ault and will stay up and running for at least 99.95% of the time.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nThey share power\", \"ful features like automatic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and easy authentication and authoriz\", \"ation. They also allow you to debug your application while it is running in production (with the Sna\", \"pshot Debugger) and work very well with Application Insights, which you can use to monitor every asp\", \"ect of your app, from performance to usage.\\n\\n## There are several different types of App Service app\", \"s.\\n\\n## Azure Web Apps\\n\\nRunning a .NET web application in Azure is very easy in Azure Web Apps . Web \", \"Apps act as a web server as a service, like IIS . And you can simply deploy your ASP.NET or ASP.NET \", \"Core application with Visual Studio to Web Apps and run it. These can be websites, APIs, or any othe\", \"r HTTP-driven application including Node.js, Python and Java applications .\\n\\nOnce your application r\", \"uns in an App Service web app, you can scale it up or down, add easy authentication, use deployment \", \"slots, enable continuous deployment, and use any of the other App Service features. By default, your\", \" application is available on the internet, without you needing to set up a domain name or configure \", \"DNS settings, although you can do that.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nTry it now- Get started by creating an ASP.\", \"NET Core web app in Azure\\n\\n## Containers on App Services\\n\\nDevelopers who want the power of App Servi\", \"ces but need to maintain a higher level of control over their environments can also run containers. \", \"Both Linux and Windows containers are supported. You can deploy your own containers from the Azure C\", \"ontainer Registry, a private Docker registry or public containers from the Docker Hub. This allows y\", \"ou to run a wide range of pre-configured applications from WordPress to Redis which can be deployed \", \"either as single containers or as part of a multi-container application . Windows container support \", \"also helps you migrate existing ASP.NET apps and WCF services that need access to the Windows OS, in\", \"stall custom components, or use the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) .\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Azure Mobile A\", \"pps\\n\\nIf you are building mobile applications, you will need a back end that the mobile app connects \", \"to. Usually, this is some sort of API that your app can use to retrieve and store data. Azure Mobile\", \" Apps provides you with such a back end. You can write it in C# or use any of the Quickstart applica\", \"tions.\\n\\nA mobile back end that runs in Azure Mobile Apps provides unique capabilities. For instance,\", \" you can use offline sync , which enables the mobile app to continue working when there is no connec\", \"tion to the back end and sync changes once the connection is restored. And with push notifications y\", \"ou can send notifications to the mobile apps using C# code, regardless of the platform it runs on (i\", \"OS, Android, Windows). In addition to these unique features, Mobile Apps shares all the other featur\", \"es of Azure App Service.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGet started by creating an Android app with an Azure mobil\", \"e app back end .\\n\\n## Azure Functions (also known as serverless compute)\\n\\nAzure Function apps enable \", \"you to create Azure Functions in C# and many other languages in Visual Studio and other IDEs and edi\", \"tors. Each Functions app contains one or more Azure Functions and provides integration with authenti\", \"cation and deployment slots.\\n\\nThe Azure Functions that run in Azure Function apps are small pieces o\", \"f code that you write, without you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or about scal\", \"ing. Many refer to this deployment model as Functions as a Service (FaaS).\\n\\nFunction applications ca\", \"n be simply triggered by a wide variety of events originating both inside and outside of Azure. HTTP\", \" triggers allow web requests to be served by a function app. Event Grid events can trigger Azure Fun\", \"ctions when changes are made to Azure resources such as the container registry and virtual machines.\", \"\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nHere is an example: You write an Azure Functions app that executes every time a ne\", \"w image file is uploaded to Azure Storage. You then take that image, rename it, and output it to ano\", \"ther Azure Storage account.\\n\\nThis is very easy to do. You just write the code to rename the image. A\", \"zure Functions takes care of getting the input image when the function is triggered . And it takes c\", \"are of writing the image to the other storage account. It takes care of all the plumbing, and you ju\", \"st write the code.\\n\\nAzure Functions even handles scaling for you . So it doesn't matter if there are\", \" 1,000 images that trigger the function at the same time. Azure Functions transparently spins up mor\", \"e functions to deal with it and they go away when the code is done executing. Because of this, you o\", \"nly pay for the code that you execute, not for a service that runs all the time, waiting to be trigg\", \"ered.\\n\\nAzure Functions are great for executing small pieces of code that perform one or two steps on\", \" an input and an output. If you want to perform more steps of a larger process, you can use Durable \", \"Functions .\\n\\nDurable Functions provide a stateful experience on top of a series of Azure Functions. \", \"They enable complex patterns such as scatter/gather and function chaining. A Durable Function orches\", \"tration may be as simple as coupling together two functions, one after another, or as complex as coo\", \"rdinating tens of thousands of function calls over weeks.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGet started by creating y\", \"our first Azure Function with Visual Studio. .\\n\\n## Azure Logic Apps\\n\\nDurable Functions are a fantast\", \"ic orchestration tool for developers who are comfortable with writing every step of the process insi\", \"de a series of Functions. For those looking for a lower code solution Logic Applications may be bett\", \"er. With Azure Logic Apps, you can orchestrate a process just by weaving API calls together in a vis\", \"ual designer in Visual Studio or the Azure portal. Visual Studio offers a specific Logic Apps projec\", \"t template to get started.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGet started by building your first logic app workflow in\", \" the Azure portal.\\n\\nA logic app has a trigger, just like an Azure function does. This can be an outs\", \"ide trigger, like when a new blob is added, or a certain text is tweeted. Or it can be a manual trig\", \"ger or a trigger on a schedule such as every 15 minutes.\\n\\nOnce triggered, a logic app takes its inpu\", \"t and calls APIs with it to complete a process. You just click this together by choosing APIs from a\", \" large list of available ones and choosing the input and output for those APIs. Azure Functions can \", \"also be used for APIs in a logic app. And you can use your own ASP.NET Core APIs.\\n\\n## Here\\u2019s anexamp\", \"le:\\n\\nA logic app gets triggered by a new blob that is written in Azure Blob storage. It takes the Bl\", \"ob input, which is an image file, and resizes the image by calling an Azure function that does just \", \"that. Next, it takes the resized image and writes it to another storage account. And finally, it cal\", \"ls the Office 365 API to send an email to the administrator that there is a new, resized image avail\", \"able.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nJust like Azure functions, logic apps scale automatically, yo\", \"u just create the process. It will trigger as many times as it is needed and always executes the com\", \"plete process and has reliability features, like retry policies, built in. And because it only runs \", \"when it is triggered, you only pay for when it runs\\u2014you don't pay for owning it.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGe\", \"t started by building your first logic app workflow in the Azure portal .\\n\\nNote: Azure Logic Apps an\", \"d Azure Functions work very well with the Azure Event Grid service. Event Grid allows you to subscri\", \"be to events, like when something happens in your application, and to push that information as an ev\", \"ent that can trigger a Logic App or an Azure Function.\\n\\n## Azure Virtual Machines\\n\\nA very different \", \"way of running your application is by taking advantage of Azure Virtual Machines . This is an easy w\", \"ay to get started, because you can lift-and-shift existing applications from virtual machines that y\", \"ou run in your datacenter to VMs that run in Azure. There are many predefined VM images that you can\", \" use, like Windows Server 2019 that runs IIS and has ASP.NET installed and preconfigured on it. You \", \"can even bring your own software licenses if you already have one (like for SQL Server).\\n\\nRunning yo\", \"ur application in a VM doesn't provide you the features like zero-downtime deployments and easy auth\", \"entication. You are also responsible for patching the operating system and for making sure that anti\", \"virus software is up to date.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it does provide you with the ability to easily sca\", \"le your VM to a bigger size or automatically scale it down when it isn't used that much. Virtual Mac\", \"hine Scale Sets allow for scaling out VMs to a large number of nodes and load balancing work between\", \" them. And it offers you the reliability of running something in Azure. It is very unlikely that you\", \"r VM will stop running, and Microsoft guarantees this uptime with a comprehensive SLA .\\n\\nAnd if you'\", \"re not ready to run your production VMs in Azure you can still take advantage of streamlined DevOps \", \"and testing with Azure DevTest Labs.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGet started by Creating a Windows virtual mach\", \"ine with the Azure portal. a.\\n\\n## A word about microservices and containers\\n\\nYou can run your applic\", \"ations in containers , which are very lightweight and start and stop in seconds. Containers isolate \", \"your application and its dependencies in a way that guarantees that you'll never run into library ve\", \"rsion conflicts. They can be based on numerous popular Linux distributions or Windows Server so no m\", \"atter the platform your application uses it can run in a container.\\n\\nA popular approach for containe\", \"rs is to use them to run a microservices architecture . This means that you create many small, isola\", \"ted, services that each have their own function and each have separate development and deployment li\", \"fecycles. Containers can also be used to lift and shift existing applications to run at scale in the\", \" cloud.\\n\\nAzure provides several services to support running a microservices architecture in containe\", \"rs. Running the increasingly popular orchestration engine Kubernetes , Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS\", \") provides a powerful tool to run anything from a handful of containers to hundreds of thousands of \", \"them . AKS can all run and orchestrate containers. Orchestration of containers is quite different fr\", \"om orchestrating a process , like Logic Apps does. Orchestrating containers means that you manage th\", \"eir lifecycles.

In Azure, you can run your SQL Server workload in Azure SQL Database\", \" . This is SQL Server in the cloud. It is the same thing that you run on-premises but it offers a lo\", \"t of advantages.\\n\\nYou can do (almost) everything with it that you can do with on-premises SQL Server\", \". And, in fact, new SQL Server features are incorporated in Azure SQL Database first and later in th\", \"e on -premises SQL Server.\\n\\nYou can use Azure SQL Databases with your favorite tools, like Azure Dat\", \"a Studio , Server Explorer and SQL Server Data Tools in Visual Studio and SQL Server Management Stud\", \"io .\\n\\nBecause they run in the cloud, Azure SQL Databases are fully managed, scalable, and high perfo\", \"rming. They are automatically backed up and have many advanced features, such as:\\n\\n- Single-click Ge\", \"o-replication, which replicates data to other geographical regions in real time, incredibly easily .\", \" (Get started with geo-replication . )\\n- Dynamic data masking, which masks sensitive data for certai\", \"n users at runtime. (Get started with dynamic data masking.)\\n- Auditing, which provides a complete a\", \"udit trail of all the actions that happen to the data. (Get started with Azure SQL Database auditing\", \".)\\n- Automatic database tuning, which monitors the performance of your database and tunes it automat\", \"ically. (Get started with Azure SQL Database automatic tuning.)\\n\\nIn addition to all these features, \", \"Azure SQL Databases are exceptionally reliable by default. Without configuring anything, transaction\", \" log backups are made every 5-10 minutes and differential backups every 12 hours. These backups are \", \"stored three times in the local datacenter and three times in another datacenter. And you can restor\", \"e backups from 35 days ago, depending on the pricing tier that you use.\\n\\nIt is very easy to use Azur\", \"e SQL Databases from a .NET application. You can, for instance, use the Entity Framework (or Entity \", \"Framework Core) to access the database and write and read data to and from it. For the most part acc\", \"essing data programmatically is no different from accessing data in an on-premises SQL Server.\\n\\n<!--\", \" image -->\\n\\nGet started by creating an Azure SQL Database in the Azure Portal . a.\\n\\n## Azure Cosmos \", \"DB\\n\\nAzure Cosmos DB is a new kind of database that is globally distributed and cloud native . Here a\", \"re some of its key features:\\n\\n- A 99.99% SLA (99.999% for read operations) that includes low latenci\", \"es (less than 10 ms on reads; less than 15 ms on writes).\\n- Geo -replication, which replicates data \", \"to other geographical regions in real time (How to distribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB).\\n-\", \" Tunable data consistency levels , so you can choose data consistency, enabling a truly globally dis\", \"tributed data system. You can, for instance, choose strong consistency , eventual consistency, or se\", \"ssion consistency .\\n- Traffic management, which sends users to the data replica to which they are cl\", \"osest.\\n- Limitless global scale. You pay only for the throughput and storage that you need.\\n- Automa\", \"tic indexing of data. No need to maintain or tune the database anymore.\\n\\nIn addition to all these fe\", \"atures, Cosmos DB offers different APIs with which you can store and retrieve data, including SQL, G\", \"remlin, MongoDB, Azure Table Storage, and Apache Cassandra. Different APIs handle data in different \", \"ways. You can use documents as data as well as unstructured tables, graphs, and blobs. You use the A\", \"PI that fits your\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nneeds, and Cosmos DB takes care of the rest. If your application \", \"already uses one of these protocols switching to Cosmos DB is as simple as changing a connection str\", \"ing.\\n\\nYou benefit from cloud -grade performance, scalability, and reliability, and still use the pro\", \"gramming model to which you're accustomed.\\n\\nYou can use Cosmos DB from .NET Framework and .NET Core.\", \" For example, you can use its SQL API through the NuGet package Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB or Micros\", \"oft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core (for .NET Core).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGet started with Azure Cosmos DB with th\", \"e SQL API and .NET Core. r.\\n\\n## Azure Storage\\n\\nWith Azure Storage , one of the most fundamental serv\", \"ices in Azure, you can store data in different forms. It is easy to use, fast, and inexpensive. Azur\", \"e Storage offers several types of storage that you can use for different scenarios. All these storag\", \"e types share common features like encryption for data at rest , security through shared access sign\", \"atures , and firewalls and virtual networks .\\n\\nAzure Storage is also very reliable. By default, data\", \" is replicated three times within the datacenter. You can also choose geo-replicated storage, which,\", \" in addition to the three local replicas, replicates the data three times to another datacenter. You\", \" can create your application in such a manner that it reads from this geo-replicated data, which is \", \"close to your users, so that it is geographically high performing.\\n\\nYou can use Azure Storage from y\", \"our .NET Framework and .NET Core applications by using the WindowsAzure.Storage NuGet package and re\", \"ferencing the specific API that you need, like Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob (for Blob storage\", \") in a using statement in your code.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Let\\u2019s explore the different types of Azure \", \"Storage:\\n\\n## File Storage\\n\\nAzure File storage uses the SMB protocol, which makes it very suitable fo\", \"r lifting and shifting your file server into the cloud. When you have files in Azure Files, you can \", \"mount an Azure file share to a VM or even to your own Windows machine, to use as external storage.\\n\\n\", \"<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Get started with Azure Files. s.\\n\\nAzure Disk Storage is a similar service to Azur\", \"e File but is dedicated to a single machine. It is available in four different performance levels fr\", \"om Standard HDD to Ultra SSD . The high performance tiers are suitable for heavy I/O workloads such \", \"as running SAP HANA or complex analytical models.\\n\\n## Table Storage\\n\\nAzure Table storage is an inexp\", \"ensive and extremely fast NoSQL key-value store that you can use to store data in flexible tables. A\", \" table can contain one row describing an order and another row describing customer information. You \", \"don't need to define a data schema. This makes Table Storage very flexible.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Blob\", \" Storage\\n\\nYou can use Azure Blob storage to store large unstructured data\\u2014literally, blobs of data.\\n\", \"\\nThis can be video, image, audio, text, or even virtual hard drive (VHD) files for VMs. Additionally\", \", you can use Blob tiers to reduce your storage costs. By default, blobs are written to the hot tier\", \", which means that they are written and read very fast. You can also put blobs in the cool tier if y\", \"ou have data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days. The cool tier is less ex\", \"pensive than the hot tier. And finally, you can store blobs in the archive tier, that is the least e\", \"xpensive. The archive tier is for data\\n\\nGet started with Azure Table storage. e.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nth\", \"at is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days. Reading data from the archive tier can take \", \"hours. Blob tiering is a great way to save costs if you are storing large amounts of data.\\n\\n<!-- ima\", \"ge -->\\n\\n## Get started with Azure Blob storage. e.\\n\\n## Queue Storage\\n\\nAzure Queue storage is an unus\", \"ual type of storage in that it is used to store small messages of data, but its main purpose is to s\", \"erve as a queue. You put messages on the queue and other processes pick it up. This pattern decouple\", \"s the message sender from the message processor and results in performance and reliability benefits.\", \" Azure Queue storage is similar to Microsoft Message Queuing that you can find in Windows.\\n\\n<!-- ima\", \"ge -->\\n\\n## Get started with Azure Queue storage. e.\\n\\n|Note: Azure Service Bus Topics and Queues also\", \" provide queuing mechanisms, with slightly different properties than Azure Storage queues.\\n\\n## Azure\", \" Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB\\n\\nAs a .NET developer, you encounter many different ope\", \"n-source database types in your job. Some of them can now be used in a managed version in Azure.\\n\\nAz\", \"ure provides MySQL , PostgreSQL , and MariaDB databases as managed databases, which means that you j\", \"ust spin them up and don't have to worry about any of the underlying infrastructure. Just like Azure\", \" SQL Databases and Cosmos DB, these databases are universally available, scalable, highly secure, an\", \"d fully managed.\\n\\nEach of these is suited for slightly different use cases, but in general, their fu\", \"nctionality overlaps a lot. You would use Azure Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB when yo\", \"u are already using one of their on-premises versions and want the advantage of having that run full\", \"y managed in the cloud. Migrating apps that use these databases is much easier when the data can rem\", \"ain in its original platform. Azure also provides an out of the box backend for services like WordPr\", \"ess which rely on open source databases.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGet started with Azure Database for MySQL \", \"by creating a MySOL server\\n\\nGet started with Azure SQL Data Warehouse by creating and query by using\", \" the Azure porta.\\n\\na warehouse in the Azure portal\\n\\n## Get started with Azure Database for MySQL by \", \"creating a MySQL server by using the Azure portal .\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Azure SQL Data Warehouse and\", \" Azure Data Lake Store\\n\\nSince we are talking about storing data in Azure, we can't leave out the dat\", \"a stores for big data and data analytics. These are not typical stores that you use with your applic\", \"ation, but rather stores that you use for data analytics and reporting.\\n\\nAzure provides two data sto\", \"res that are very suitable for storing large amounts of data for data analytics purposes: the Azure \", \"SQL Data Warehouse and the Azure Data Lake Store .\\n\\nEach of these can hold petabytes of data. In fac\", \"t, Azure Data Lake Store doesn't even have limits on the amount of data and the file sizes that you \", \"can store.\\n\\nYou use Azure SQL Data Warehouse when you know the questions that you want to answer wit\", \"h data analytics. You define a data schema that determines what your data will look like and how it \", \"can be used.\\n\\nYou use Azure Data Lake Store when you don't know the questions that you want to answe\", \"r yet. You do not have to define a data schema for the Data Lake Store. You store data in its native\", \" format.\\n\\nYou can work with each of these data stores with tools in Visual Studio. And you can use a\", \"ny SQL tool, like SQL Server Management Studio, to work with Azure SQL Data Warehouse. You can even \", \"create eye-popping business intelligence dashboards and reports as a non -developer in Power BI .\\n\\nA\", \"dditionally, you can use the Azure Management SDK for .NET to perform management operations on these\", \" services. You can, for instance, create a new Data Lake Store account .\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGet starte\", \"d with Azure SQL Data Warehouse by creating and query a warehouse in the Azure portal. l.\\n\\n<!-- imag\", \"e -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Securing your .NET applications in Azure\\n\\nBesides running your application\", \" and storing data, you need to secure it. Azure can help you with that by providing authentication a\", \"nd authorization through Azure Active Directory and by helping you to keep secrets safe with Azure K\", \"ey Vault and inserting credentials into your application with Managed Service Identity . Let's exami\", \"ne these services.\\n\\n## Azure Active Directory\\n\\nAn important part of your application's security is a\", \"uthenticating users before they can use it. Authentication is not an easy thing to implement. You ne\", \"ed to store user identities and credentials, implement password management, create a secure authenti\", \"cation handshake, and so on.\\n\\nAzure Active Directory provides all these things and more out of the b\", \"ox. You store your user identities in Azure Active Directory and have users authenticate against it,\", \" redirecting them to your application only after they are authenticated. Azure Active Directory take\", \"s care of password management, including common scenarios like \\\"I forgot my password.\\\" Azure Active \", \"Directory is used by millions of applications every day, including the Azure portal , Outlook.com, a\", \"nd Office 365 . Because of this, it is able to more readily detect malicious behavior and act on it.\", \" For instance, if a user were to sign in to an application from a location in Europe and then one mi\", \"nute later sign in from Australia, Azure Active Directory would flag this as malicious behavior and \", \"ask the user for additional credentials through multifactor authentication.\\n\\nTo programmatically tal\", \"k to Azure Active Directory, you can use the Active Directory Authenticating Library (ADAL) for .NET\", \" Framework and .NET Core .\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGet Started by using Azure Key Vault from an ASP.NET app\", \"lication\\n\\nGet started by integrating Azure AD into an ASP.NET Core web app\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Get s\", \"tarted by integrating Azure AD into an ASP.NET Core web app. p.\\n\\n## Azure Key Vault\\n\\nIt is important\", \" to keep secrets such as passwords and connection strings out of source code. So where do you put th\", \"em? In Azure Key Vault .\\n\\nAzure Key Vault is a safe place to store passwords, connection strings, ac\", \"cess codes, and certificate keys. It is fully managed by Azure, so you don't have to worry about the\", \" underlying infrastructure. You just spin it up and use it.\\n\\nYou can use it as a configuration store\", \" in your applications, just like you would use a web.config file. An administrator can populate the \", \"values in the Azure Key Vault, and your application just pulls it out at startup time or whenever it\", \" needs it. This way, passwords will never be in source code and are the responsibility of the Azure \", \"Key Vault administrator.\\n\\nYou can use Azure Key Vault using the Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault NuGet packa\", \"ge that you can use from the .NET Framework and .NET Core. There is even a special syntax which allo\", \"ws pulling secrets from KeyVault in App Services with zero code changes. For more complex scenarios \", \"where configuration changes based on location, release or some other custom dimension Microsoft is i\", \"ntroducing Azure App Configuration a service dedicated to providing a centralized configuration loca\", \"tion which can be used from everything form App Services to a DevOps pipeline.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nGet \", \"Started by using Azure Key Vault from an ASP.NET application. o.\\n\\n## Managed Service Identity\\n\\nEven \", \"when you use Azure Key Vault, your application must have some credentials in its configuration .

The recommendations include how to \", \"save money by making more efficient use of Azure resources and suggestions on how to make your Azure\", \" resources more secure. The security advisor will catch and rank problems like world readable Blob S\", \"torage and give instructions on how to better secure your environment.\\n\\n## Other Azure services\\n\\n## \", \"Enhance your application performance\\n\\nAzure can also help you to boost your applications' performanc\", \"e. One service that helps with this is Azure Redis Cache, which provides high-performance, in-memory\", \", key-value storage. Another is Azure Content Delivery Network , or CDN, which can replicate your st\", \"atic content, like images and video files to points-of-presence all over the world, making sure that\", \" it is as close to your users as possible. And finally, Azure Traffic Manager can improve applicatio\", \"n responsiveness by routing users to locations with the lowest latency.\\n\\n## Machine Learning\\n\\nAzure \", \"provides an industry leading suite of services that can make your application more intelligent. Azur\", \"e Cognitive Services are a suite of APIs that can do things which would be nearly impossible using t\", \"raditional programming approaches. You can quickly build\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\napplications which can rec\", \"ognize faces, convert speech to text and understand the meaning of text. Using the Language Understa\", \"nding service you can create bots which can intelligently respond to requests in Slack, Microsoft Te\", \"ams and other forums. You can also create your own machine learning algorithms with Azure Machine Le\", \"arning . Training jobs created in popular tools such as Tensorflow can be submitted to run on a clus\", \"ter of GPU -enabled Virtual Machines , vastly decreasing the time to train models.\\n\\n## Internet of T\", \"hings (IoT)\\n\\nWhen you are building a solution based on the Internet of Things, Azure can help you wi\", \"th services like Azure IoT Hub , which can ingest massive amounts of messages from IoT devices and m\", \"anage the devices. Azure IoT Suite makes it possible for you to manage your IoT devices without doin\", \"g everything yourself. And if you have limited IoT experience, you can use Azure IoT Central , which\", \" is a SaaS solution that enables you to use IoT with minimal customization. And finally, there is Az\", \"ure IoT Edge , which allows IoT devices to do some of the calculations locally, instead of having to\", \" communicate with the cloud for every operation. Trained ML models can even be deployed to edge devi\", \"ces enabling capabilities such as image recognition in disconnected hardware.\\n\\n## Data Analytics\\n\\nTh\", \"ere are many services in Azure for doing data analytics, including Azure Data Factory for moving and\", \" transforming data; Azure Analysis Services , which provides an inmemory data analytics platform; an\", \"d Azure Data Lake Analytics, which can perform USQL jobs on Azure Data Lake Store . You can also tak\", \"e advantage of Azure Stream Analytics to analyze data on the fly and Azure Time Series Insights, whi\", \"ch provides a unique data analytics platform for time-based data that can store and analyze data and\", \" can show information using its own data visualization engine. In addition, there is Azure Databrick\", \"s , which offers a managed cluster of enhanced Apache Spark\\u2013based analytics engines, and Azure HDIns\", \"ight , which you can use to spin up managed clusters of opensource data analytics platforms and tool\", \"s, like Apache Storm , Apache Kafka, and Apache HBase .\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Messaging\\n\\nAzure also pr\", \"ovides services that can help you build scalable architectures with events and messages . Azure Queu\", \"e Storage and Azure Service Bus Topics and Queues can help with that by providing queuing mechanisms\", \" that decouple your services . Azure Event Grid can help by subscribing to events, like blobs being \", \"added and pushing an event to whoever is subscribed to it. And Azure Event Hubs can ingest massive a\", \"mounts of data, which you can process, filter, and store in your own time. Using messaging to commun\", \"icate between services in Azure allows you to handle load smoothly while also preventing data loss i\", \"n the event a service is unavailable.\\n\\n## Media Services\\n\\nWorking with (streaming) media can be chal\", \"lenging. Azure Media Services can help you by providing services like encoding , which encodes your \", \"media files into the file formats and screen sizes they need to be. Azure Content Protection enables\", \" you to use DRM technologies like PlayReady to make sure that your content is only used by authorize\", \"d users. With live streaming you can stream media worldwide at massive scale. And by using Media Ana\", \"lytics you can enhance media by doing intelligent things like creating subtitles for a movie based o\", \"n speech.\\n\\n## Monitoring\\n\\nAnd finally, you need to monitor your applications that run in Azure, to m\", \"ake sure that they run smoothly. The monitoring tools in Azure fall under the umbrella of Azure Moni\", \"tor. There are services like Azure Application Insights that can help you to monitor every aspect of\", \" your application. There is also Azure Log Analytics, which plugs into every Azure Service to gather\", \" diagnostics information, and Azure Network Watcher , which can inspect network traffic from your VM\", \"s and over your Virtual Networks .\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nMonitoring &amp; Analytics v + New dashboard to \", \"Add filter\\n\\nFigure 1 A sample monitoring dashboard\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nCONTOSORETAILWEB\\n\\nOPERATION...

Ideally, you would do these things continuously, whenever somebody commit\", \"s new work.\\n\\nAzure DevOps, can help with that. It is an application lifecycle management system that\", \" manages your work items and sprints, stores and manages your source code, builds your code, and dep\", \"loys it to wherever you want. The best part is, it is very easy to set up.\\n\\nYou can put your source \", \"code in DevOps and manage it using the TFS or Git protocols. Once you start committing changes, you \", \"can have those built by a simple build pipeline that executes something like a Visual Studio build, \", \"just like you would on your local development computer.
