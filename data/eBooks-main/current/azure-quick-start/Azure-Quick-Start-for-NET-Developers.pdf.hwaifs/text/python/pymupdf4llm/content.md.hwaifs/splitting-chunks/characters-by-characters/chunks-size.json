Written by developers for developers in the .NET ecosystem, this\\n\\nguide will show you how to get started with Azure and which services you can use to run\\n\\nyour .NET applications and\", \" store your data in a more efficient and secure way.\\n\\n\\nBefore we dive in, let\\u2019s take a moment to see what the cloud, and Microsoft Azure in\\n\\nparticular, can do for you.\\n\\n#### What can Azure do for you?\\n\\nAzure provides services that can help you accomplish many things. These range from\\n\\nthe mundane\\u2014such as adding search functionality to your application or spinning up\\n\\na new SQL database to connect to your recent .NET app\\u2014to more exotic projects\\n\\nsuch as implementing continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)\\n\\nworkflows. You also can automatically tune your database or set up push notifications\\n\\nto mobile devices, easily and quickly. These are just a few examples of some common\\n\\nprojects that developers have repeatedly had to create for themselves but that are\\n\\nnow available as a service. And you can use these services with little effort\\u2014almost\\n\\nlike flipping a light switch! You can then focus on the pieces of your application that\\n\\nmake it unique\\u2014the features that provi\", \"de real added value for your users.\\n\\n\\nBesides services, Azure offers compute resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs),\\n\\ncontainers, databases, web app services, and mobile services. You can use these to host\\n\\napplications or to provide a complete infrastructure for your users, most of which you\\n\\ncan do through Visual Studio.\\n\\n\\nThe power of the cloud is that services and resources are incredibly robust and resilient.\\n\\nIt is very unlikely that they will fail to run, because the cloud is smart and self-healing.\\n\\nWith Azure, there are datacenters all over the world, filled with tens of thousands of\\n\\nservers. If one server fails, another takes over. If an entire datacenter were to fail (a highly\\n\\nunlikely scenario), another would take over. All this is possible because of the massive\\n\\nscale of the cloud.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 5\\n\\n\\nOne of the most compelling arguments in favor of the cloud is that you can scale up\\n\\nyour services and resources almost infinitely, \", \"with just a few clicks of a button. You can\\u2019t\\n\\ndo that with on-premises resources unless you\\u2019re prepared to spend enormous sums of\\n\\nmoney on capital equipment which would remain largely idle and staff to administer it\\n\\nall. You can scale globally without having to build data centers around the world by\\n\\nputting your services anywhere in the world eliminating latency and providing a high\\nperformance experience to your users, regardless of where they are. It also means that\\n\\nyou can keep your data where you need it to be, observing data residency\\n\\nrequirements.\\n\\n\\nEqually important, when you use cloud resources, you can scale back your services and\\n\\nresources when there is no longer high demand. This allows you to scale up and down\\n\\neven during the course of a normal day keeping applications economical and\\n\\nperformant.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to massive scalability, off-the-shelf intelligent services, and pay-per-use\\n\\nefficiency, the cloud offers increased security. The cloud is used by millions of\", \" people,\\n\\n24x7, worldwide. Of course, it is also attacked by many people. Reputable and\\n\\nexperienced cloud providers like Microsoft recognize the usage patterns of normal users\\n\\nand those of malicious actors. This means we know how to protect against both the\\n\\nmost common and most unique attacks out there. Intelligent monitoring tools, machine\\n\\nlearning algorithms, and artificial intelligence give cloud providers the ability to detect\\n\\nattacks in real time and stop them in their tracks.\\n\\n\\n[Decades of experience in security](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/trusted-cloud/) and massive-scale traffic, combined with top industry\\n\\nsecurity expertise, make the cloud a much more secure environment than any on\\npremises datacenter.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 6\\n\\n\\n### Getting Started with Azure services\\n\\nLet\\u2019s explore some of the services that you can use for running your applications in\\n\\nAzure, storing your data in Azure, and securing your application with Azure.\\n\\n#### Run\", \"ning your .NET applications in Azure\\n\\nOne of the first decisions that you need to make when you start with Azure is which\\n\\nservice(s) to use to run your applications in Azure. There are many options. Let\\u2019s start by\\n\\nlaying out which Azure services are most suitable for which application types in Table 1.\\n\\n\\n**Table 1:** Which Azure services are best suited for which types of applications?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|App Service<br>Web Apps<br>Monolithic<br>and N-Tier<br>applications|Col2|App Service<br>Mobile<br>Apps|Azure<br>Functions|Logic Apps|Virtual<br>Machines<br>*|Azure<br>Kubernetes<br>Service (AKS)|Container<br>Instances|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|**Mobile app**<br>**back end**|||||*|||\\n|**Microservice**<br>**architecture-**<br>**based**<br>**applications**||||||||\\n|**Business process**<br>**orchestrations**<br>**and workflows** <br>|<br>|<br>|<br>|||||\\n\\n\\n\\n- For lifting and shifting existing applications to Azure.\\n\\n#### Azure App Services\\n\\nOne of the easiest and most powerful ways\", \" to host your applications in Azure is in Azure\\n\\n[App Service. Azure App Service is a group of services that takes care of hosting your](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/)\\n\\napplication and abstracting away the complexities of the operating system and\\n\\ninfrastructure. They are highly available by default and will stay up and running for at\\n\\nleast [99.95%](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/app-service/v1_4/) of the time.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 7\\n\\n\\nThey share powerful features like automatic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and\\n\\neasy authentication and authorization. They also allow you to debug your application\\n\\nwhile it is running in production (with the Snapshot Debugger) and work very well with\\n\\nApplication Insights, which you can use to monitor every aspect of your app, from\\n\\nperformance to usage.\\n\\n#### There are several different types of App Service apps.\\n\\n\\n**Azure Web Apps**\\n\\n\\n[Running a .NET web application in Azure is v\", \"ery easy in Azure Web Apps. Web Apps act](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/)\\n\\nas a web server as a service, like [IIS. And you can simply deploy your ASP.NET or](https://www.iis.net/)\\n\\nASP.NET Core application with Visual Studio to Web Apps and run it. These can be\\n\\nwebsites, APIs, or any other HTTP-driven application including Node.js, Python and Java\\n\\napplications.\\n\\n\\n[Once your application runs in an App Service web app, you can scale it up or down, add](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-scale)\\n\\n[easy authentication, use](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) [deployment slots, enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-staged-publishing) [continuous deployment, and use any](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-continuous-deployment)\\n\\nof the other App Service features. By default, your application is available on the\\n\\ninternet, without you needing to set up a d\", \"omain name or configure DNS settings,\\n\\nalthough you can do that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Containers on App Services**\\n\\n\\nDevelopers who want the power of App Services but need to maintain a higher level of\\n\\n[control over their environments can also run containers. Both Linux and Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/)\\n\\n[containers are supported. You can deploy your own containers from the Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-windows-container)\\n\\n[Container Registry, a private Docker registry or public containers from the Docker Hub.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/)\\n\\nThis allows you to run a wide range of pre-configured applications from WordPress to\\n\\n[Redis which can be deployed either as single containers or as part of a multi-container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-multi-container)\\n\\n[application. Windows container support also helps you migrate existing A\", \"SP.NET apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-multi-container)\\n\\nand WCF services that need access to the Windows OS, install custom components, or\\n\\nuse the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 8\\n\\n\\n**Azure Mobile Apps**\\n\\n\\nIf you are building mobile applications, you will need a back end that the mobile app\\n\\nconnects to. Usually, this is some sort of API that your app can use to retrieve and store\\n\\n[data. Azure Mobile Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/mobile/) provides you with such a back end. You can write it in C# or\\n\\nuse any of the Quickstart applications.\\n\\n\\nA mobile back end that runs in Azure Mobile Apps provides unique capabilities. For\\n\\n[instance, you can use offline sync, which enables the mobile app to continue working](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-offline-data-sync)\\n\\nwhen there is no connection to the back end and sync changes once the co\", \"nnection is\\n\\nrestored. And with push notifications you can send notifications to the mobile apps\\n\\nusing C# code, regardless of the platform it runs on (iOS, Android, Windows). In addition\\n\\nto these unique features, Mobile Apps shares all the other features of Azure App Service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Azure Functions (also known as serverless compute)\\n\\n[Azure Function apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) enable you to create Azure Functions in C# and many other\\n\\nlanguages in Visual Studio and other IDEs and editors. Each Functions app contains one\\n\\nor more Azure Functions and provides integration with authentication and deployment\\n\\nslots.\\n\\n\\nThe Azure Functions that run in Azure Function apps are small pieces of code that you\\n\\nwrite, without you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or about scaling.\\n\\nMany refer to this deployment model as Functions as a Service (FaaS).\\n\\n\\nFunction applications can be simply triggered by a wide variety of events origi\", \"nating\\n\\nboth inside and outside of Azure. HTTP triggers allow web requests to be served by a\\n\\n[function app. Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-grid) events can trigger Azure Functions when changes are made to\\n\\nAzure resources such as the container registry and virtual machines.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 9\\n\\n\\nHere is an example: You write an Azure Functions app that executes every time a new\\n\\nimage file is uploaded to Azure Storage. You then take that image, rename it, and\\n\\noutput it to another Azure Storage account.\\n\\n\\nThis is very easy to do. You just write the code to rename the image. Azure Functions\\n\\n[takes care of getting the input image when the function is triggered. And it takes care of](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings)\\n\\nwriting the image to the other storage account. It takes care of all the plumbing, and\\n\\nyou just write the code.\\n\\n\\nAzure Functions even [han\", \"dles scaling for you. So it doesn\\u2019t matter if there are 1,000](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale)\\n\\nimages that trigger the function at the same time. Azure Functions transparently spins up\\n\\nmore functions to deal with it and they go away when the code is done executing.\\n\\nBecause of this, you only pay for the code that you execute, not for a service that runs all\\n\\nthe time, waiting to be triggered.\\n\\n\\nAzure Functions are great for executing small pieces of code that perform one or two\\n\\nsteps on an input and an output. If you want to perform more steps of a larger process,\\n\\n[you can use Durable Functions.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview)\\n\\n\\nDurable Functions provide a stateful experience on top of a series of Azure Functions.\\n\\nThey enable complex patterns such as scatter/gather and function chaining. A Durable\\n\\nFunction orchestration may be as simple as coupling together two functions, one after\\n\\nanot\", \"her, or as complex as coordinating tens of thousands of function calls over weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Azure Logic Apps\\n\\nDurable Functions are a fantastic orchestration tool for developers who are comfortable\\n\\nwith writing every step of the process inside a series of Functions. For those looking for\\n\\na lower code solution Logic Applications may be better. With Azure Logic Apps, you can\\n\\norchestrate a process just by weaving API calls together in a visual designer in Visual\\n\\nStudio or the Azure portal. Visual Studio offers a specific Logic Apps project template to\\n\\nget started.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 10\\n\\n\\nA logic app has a trigger, just like an Azure function does. This can be an outside trigger,\\n\\nlike when a new blob is added, or a certain text is tweeted. Or it can be a manual trigger\\n\\nor a trigger on a schedule such as every 15 minutes.\\n\\n\\nOnce triggered, a logic app takes its input and calls APIs with it to complete a process.\\n\\nYou just click this together by choosing API\", \"s from a large list of available ones and\\n\\nchoosing the input and output for those APIs. Azure Functions can also be used for APIs\\n\\nin a logic app. And you can use your own ASP.NET Core APIs.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust like Azure functions, logic apps scale automatically, you just create the process. It will trigger as\\nmany times as it is needed and always executes the complete process and has reliability features, like\\nretry policies, built in. And because it only runs when it is triggered, you only pay for when it runs\\u2014you\\ndon\\u2019t pay for owning it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions work very well with the [Azure Event Grid service. Event Grid allows you to](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/)\\nsubscribe to events, like when something happens in your application, and to push that information as an event that can\\ntrigger a Logic App or an Azure Function.\\n\\n#### Azure Virtual Machines\\n\\n[A very different way of running your application is by taking advantage of Azure Virtual](h\", \"ttps://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/)\\n\\n[Machines. This is an easy way to get started, because you can lift-and-shift existing](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/)\\n\\napplications from virtual machines that you run in your datacenter to VMs that run in\\n\\nAzure. There are many predefined VM images that you can use, like Windows Server\\n\\n2019 that runs IIS and has ASP.NET installed and preconfigured on it. You can even\\n\\nbring your own software licenses if you already have one (like for SQL Server).\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 11\\n\\n\\nRunning your application in a VM doesn\\u2019t provide you the features like zero-downtime\\n\\ndeployments and easy authentication. You are also responsible for patching the\\n\\noperating system and for making sure that antivirus software is up to date.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, it does provide you with the ability to easily scale your VM to a\\n\\n[bigger size or automatically scale it down when it isn\\u2019t used that much. Virtual Mac\", \"hine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/)\\n\\n[Scale Sets allow for scaling out VMs to a large number of nodes and load balancing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/)\\n\\nwork between them. And it offers you the reliability of running something in Azure. It is\\n\\nvery unlikely that your VM will stop running, and Microsoft guarantees this uptime with\\n\\na [comprehensive SLA.](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_6/)\\n\\n\\nAnd if you\\u2019re not ready to run your production VMs in Azure you can still take\\n\\nadvantage of streamlined DevOps and testing with Azure DevTest Labs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### A word about microservices and containers\\n\\n[You can run your applications in containers, which are very lightweight and start and](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/containers/)\\n\\nstop in seconds. Containers isolate your application and its dependencies in a way that\\n\\nguarantees that you\\u2019ll never run into library version conflicts. Th\", \"ey can be based on\\n\\nnumerous popular Linux distributions or Windows Server so no matter the platform your\\n\\napplication uses it can run in a container.\\n\\n\\nA popular approach for containers is to use them to run a [microservices architecture.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices)\\n\\nThis means that you create many small, isolated, services that each have their own\\n\\nfunction and each have separate development and deployment lifecycles. Containers\\n\\ncan also be used to lift and shift existing applications to run at scale in the cloud.\\n\\n\\n[Azure provides several services to support running a microservices architecture in](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices)\\n\\ncontainers. Running the increasingly popular orchestration engine Kubernetes, Azure\\n\\n[Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides a powerful tool to run anything from a handful of](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes)\\n\\n[containe\", \"rs to hundreds of thousands of them. AKS can all run and orchestrate](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-fabric/)\\n\\ncontainers. Orchestration of containers is quite different from orchestrating a process,\\n\\nlike Logic Apps does. Orchestrating containers means that you manage their lifecycles.\\n\\nProvision new ones, scale up or down, manage failures, and so on.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 12\\n\\n\\n#### Which frameworks and technologies can you use in which Azure service?\\n\\nNow that you know what the options are for running your application in Azure, it is\\n\\nextremely useful to know which version of .NET you can run in these services and what\\n\\nkind of containers they support. Table 2 explains this by showing which framework and\\n\\ncontainer types you can use in which services in Azure.\\n\\n\\n**Table 2:** Which framework and technology can you use in which Azure service\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|.NET Framework<br>apps|Web Apps|Mobile<br>Apps|Functions|Azure VMs|Azure<br>Container<br>Ins\", \"tance|Azure<br>Kubernetes<br>Service<br>(AKS)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|**.NET Core apps**|||||||\\n|**Linux Containers**|||||||\\n|**Windows Server**<br>**Containers**|||||||\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 13\\n\\n\\n### Storing your data in Azure\\n\\nData is a particularly important aspect of any modern .NET application, and it comes in\\n\\nall shapes and sizes. Azure provides many types of data stores that can help you\\n\\nmaintain and retrieve data in any scenario.\\n\\n\\n**Table 3** shows which data service to use for which scenario.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|Database Cosmos DB Blob<br>Relational data|Col2|Col3|Col4|Table|File|PostgreSQL,<br>MySQL|SQL Data<br>Warehouse|Data Lake<br>Store|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|**Unstructured**<br>**data**|||||||||\\n|**Semistructured**<br>**data**|||||||||\\n|**Files on disk**|||||||||\\n|**Store large data**|||||||||\\n|**Store small**<br>**data**|||||||||\\n|**Geographic**<br>**data**<br>**replication**|||||||||\\n|**Tunable data**<br>**consistency**|||||||||\", \"\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 14\\n\\n\\n#### Azure SQL Database\\n\\n[If you are familiar with .NET, you will likely be familiar with SQL Server. In Azure, you can](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-2017)\\n\\n[run your SQL Server workload in Azure SQL Database. This is SQL Server in the cloud. It](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)\\n\\nis the same thing that you run on-premises but it offers a lot of advantages.\\n\\n\\n[You can do (almost)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-transact-sql-information) everything with it that you can do with on-premises SQL Server.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, new SQL Server features are incorporated in Azure SQL Database first and\\n\\nlater in the on-premises SQL Server.\\n\\n\\n[You can use Azure SQL Databases with your favorite tools, like Azure Data Studio,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download?view=sql-server-2017) Server\\n\\n[Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-resou\", \"rces-server-explorer-browse-manage) and [SQL Server Data Tools in Visual Studio and SQL Server Management](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/ssdt/)\\n\\n[Studio.](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms)\\n\\n\\nBecause they run in the cloud, Azure SQL Databases are fully managed, scalable, and\\n\\nhigh performing. They are automatically backed up and have many advanced features,\\n\\nsuch as:\\n\\n\\n- **Single-click Geo-replication**, which replicates data to other geographical regions in\\n\\n[real time, incredibly easily. (Get started with geo-replication.)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-geo-replication-transact-sql)\\n\\n\\n- **Dynamic data masking**, which masks sensitive data for certain users at runtime.\\n\\n[(Get started with dynamic data masking.)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-dynamic-data-masking-get-started)\\n\\n\\n- **Auditing**, which provides a complete audit trail of all the actions that happen to the\\n\\n[data. (Get started wi\", \"th Azure SQL Database auditing.)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auditing)\\n\\n\\n- **Automatic database tuning**, which monitors the performance of your database and\\n\\n[tunes it automatically. (Get started with Azure SQL Database automatic tuning.)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automatic-tuning)\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 15\\n\\n\\nIn addition to all these features, Azure SQL Databases are exceptionally reliable by\\n\\ndefault. Without configuring anything, transaction log backups are made every 5-10\\n\\nminutes and differential backups every 12 hours. These backups are stored three times\\n\\nin the local datacenter and three times in another datacenter. And you can restore\\n\\n[backups from 35 days ago, depending on the pricing tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups#how-long-do-you-keep-my-backups) that you use.\\n\\n\\nIt is very easy to use Azure SQL Databases from a .NET application. You ca\", \"n, for instance,\\n\\nuse the [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/) (or [Entity Framework Core) to access the database and write](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/)\\n\\n[and read data to and from it. For the most part](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-connectivity-issues) accessing data programmatically is no\\n\\ndifferent from accessing data in an on-premises SQL Server.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Azure Cosmos DB\\n\\n[Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/) is a new kind of database that is globally distributed and cloud native.\\n\\nHere are some of its key features:\\n\\n\\n- **[A 99.99% SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/roadmap/azure-cosmos-db-sla-99-999-percent-read-availability-at-global-scale/)** [(99.999% for read operations) that includes low latencies (less than 10](https://azure.microsoft.com/roadmap/azure-cosmos-db-sla-99-999-percent-read-availability-at-global-scale/)\\n\\nms on reads; less than 15 ms on writes).\\n\\n\\n- **Geo-replication**, which re\", \"plicates data to other geographical regions in real time\\n\\n[(How to distribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB).](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally)\\n\\n\\n- **[Tunable data consistency levels](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels)** [, so you can choose data consistency, enabling a](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels)\\n\\ntruly globally distributed data system. You can, for instance, choose **strong**\\n\\n**consistency**, **eventual consistency**, or **session consistency** .\\n\\n\\n- **Traffic management**, which sends users to the data replica to which they are closest.\\n\\n\\n- **Limitless global scale** . You pay only for the throughput and storage that you need.\\n\\n\\n- **Automatic indexing of data** . No need to maintain or tune the database anymore.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to all these features, Cosmos DB offers different APIs with which you can\\n\\nstore and retrieve data, including SQL, Gremlin, MongoDB, Azure Table Storage, a\", \"nd\\n\\nApache Cassandra. Different APIs handle data in different ways. You can use documents\\n\\nas data as well as unstructured tables, graphs, and blobs. You use the API that fits your\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 16\\n\\n\\nneeds, and Cosmos DB takes care of the rest. If your application already uses one of\\n\\nthese protocols switching to Cosmos DB is as simple as changing a connection string.\\n\\n\\nYou benefit from cloud-grade performance, scalability, and reliability, and still use the\\n\\nprogramming model to which you\\u2019re accustomed.\\n\\n\\nYou can use Cosmos DB from .NET Framework and .NET Core. For example, you can use\\n\\n[its SQL API through the NuGet package Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB) or\\n\\n[Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core) (for .NET Core).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Azure Storage\\n\\nWith [Azure Storage, one of the most fundamental services in Azure, you can store data](https://azure.mi\", \"crosoft.com/services/storage/)\\n\\nin different forms. It is easy to use, fast, and inexpensive. Azure Storage offers several\\n\\ntypes of storage that you can use for different scenarios. All these storage types share\\n\\n[common features like encryption for data at rest, security through shared access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption)\\n\\n[signatures, and](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1) [firewalls and virtual networks.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security)\\n\\n\\n[Azure Storage is also very reliable. By default, data is replicated three times within the](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy)\\n\\ndatacenter. You can also choose geo-replicated storage, which, in addition to the three\\n\\nlocal replicas, replicates the data three times to another datacenter. You can create your\\n\\napplication in such a manner that it reads from this geo-rep\", \"licated data, which is close\\n\\nto your users, so that it is geographically high performing.\\n\\n\\nYou can use Azure Storage from your .NET Framework and .NET Core applications by\\n\\n[using the WindowsAzure.Storage NuGet package and referencing the specific API that](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/)\\n\\nyou need, like **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob** (for Blob storage) in a using\\n\\nstatement in your code.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 17\\n\\n\\n#### Let\\u2019s explore the different types of Azure Storage:\\n\\n**File Storage**\\n\\n\\n[Azure File storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/) uses the SMB protocol, which makes it very suitable for lifting and\\n\\nshifting your file server into the cloud. When you have files in Azure Files, you can mount\\n\\n[an Azure file share to a VM or even to your own Windows machine, to use as external](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/mount-azure-file-storage)\\n\\nstorage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Azure Disk Storage is a](\", \"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/unmanaged-disks/) [similar service to Azure File but is dedicated to a single machine.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-decide-blobs-files-disks)\\n\\nIt is available in four different performance levels from Standard HDD to Ultra SSD. The\\n\\nhigh performance tiers are suitable for heavy I/O workloads such as running SAP HANA\\n\\nor complex analytical models.\\n\\n\\n**Table Storage**\\n\\n\\n[Azure Table storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/tables/) is an inexpensive and extremely fast NoSQL key-value store that\\n\\nyou can use to store data in flexible tables. A table can contain one row describing an\\n\\norder and another row describing customer information. You don\\u2019t need to define a\\n\\ndata schema. This makes Table Storage very flexible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Blob Storage**\\n\\n\\n[You can use Azure Blob storage to store large unstructured data\\u2014literally, blobs of data.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/)\\n\\nThis can be vi\", \"deo, image, audio, text, or even virtual hard drive (VHD) files for VMs.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can use [Blob tiers to reduce your storage costs. By default, blobs are](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers)\\n\\nwritten to the **hot tier**, which means that they are written and read very fast. You can\\n\\nalso put blobs in the **cool tier** if you have data that is infrequently accessed and stored\\n\\nfor at least 30 days. The **cool tier** is less expensive than the **hot tier** . And finally, you can\\n\\nstore blobs in the **archive tier**, that is the least expensive. The **archive tier** is for data\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 18\\n\\n\\nthat is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days. Reading data from the archive\\n\\ntier can take hours. Blob tiering is a great way to save costs if you are storing large\\n\\namounts of data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Queue Storage**\\n\\n\\n[Azure Queue storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/queues/) is an unusual ty\", \"pe of storage in that it is used to store small\\n\\nmessages of data, but its main purpose is to serve as a queue. You put messages on the\\n\\n[queue and other processes pick it up. This pattern](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/queues/) decouples the message sender from\\n\\nthe message processor and results in performance and reliability benefits. Azure Queue\\n\\nstorage is similar to [Microsoft Message Queuing that you can find in Windows.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms711472(v=vs.85).aspx)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**|Note** [: Azure Service Bus Topics and Queues also provide queuing mechanisms, with slightly different properties than Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-how-to-use-topics-subscriptions)\\nqueues.\\n\\n#### Azure Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB\\n\\nAs a .NET developer, you encounter many different open-source database types in your\\n\\njob. Some of them can now be used in a managed version in Azure.\\n\\n\\n[Azure provides MySQ\", \"L, PostgreSQL, and](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/mysql/) [MariaDB databases as managed databases,](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/mariadb-postgresql-and-mysql-more-choices-on-microsoft-azure/)\\n\\nwhich means that you just spin them up and don\\u2019t have to worry about any of the\\n\\nunderlying infrastructure. Just like Azure SQL Databases and Cosmos DB, these\\n\\ndatabases are universally available, scalable, highly secure, and fully managed.\\n\\n\\nEach of these is suited for slightly different use cases, but in general, their functionality\\n\\noverlaps a lot. You would use Azure Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB\\n\\nwhen you are already using one of their on-premises versions and want the advantage\\n\\nof having that run fully managed in the cloud. Migrating apps that use these databases\\n\\nis much easier when the data can remain in its original platform. Azure also provides an\\n\\nout of the box backend for services like WordPress which rely on open source databases.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide\", \" for .NET Developers 19\\n\\n\\n#### Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Azure Data Lake Store\\n\\nSince we are talking about storing data in Azure, we can\\u2019t leave out the data stores for\\n\\nbig data and data analytics. These are not typical stores that you use with your\\n\\napplication, but rather stores that you use for data analytics and reporting.\\n\\n\\nAzure provides two data stores that are very suitable for storing large amounts of data\\n\\n[for data analytics purposes: the Azure SQL Data Warehouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-data-warehouse/) and the Azure Data Lake\\n\\n[Store.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-lake-store/)\\n\\n\\nEach of these can hold petabytes of data. In fact, Azure Data Lake Store doesn\\u2019t even\\n\\nhave limits on the amount of data and the file sizes that you can store.\\n\\n\\nYou use Azure SQL Data Warehouse when you know the questions that you want to\\n\\nanswer with data analytics. You define a data schema that determines what your data\\n\\nwill look like and how it can be used.\\n\\n\\n\", \"You use Azure Data Lake Store when you don\\u2019t know the questions that you want to\\n\\nanswer yet. You do not have to define a data schema for the Data Lake Store. You store\\n\\ndata in its native format.\\n\\n\\nYou can work with each of these data stores with tools in Visual Studio. And you can use\\n\\nany SQL tool, like SQL Server Management Studio, to work with Azure SQL Data\\n\\nWarehouse. You can even create eye-popping business intelligence dashboards and\\n\\n[reports as a non-developer in Power BI.](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)\\n\\n\\n[Additionally, you can use the Azure Management SDK for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.Azure.Management) to perform management\\n\\n[operations on these services. You can, for instance, create a new Data Lake Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-net-sdk)\\n\\n[account.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-net-sdk)\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 20\\n\\n\\n### S\", \"ecuring your .NET applications in Azure\\n\\nBesides running your application and storing data, you need to secure it. Azure can help\\n\\nyou with that by providing authentication and authorization through Azure Active\\n\\n[Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) and by helping you to keep secrets safe with [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) and inserting\\n\\ncredentials into your application with [Managed Service Identity. Let\\u2019s examine these](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/msi-overview)\\n\\nservices.\\n\\n#### Azure Active Directory\\n\\nAn important part of your application\\u2019s security is authenticating users before they can\\n\\nuse it. Authentication is not an easy thing to implement. You need to store user\\n\\nidentities and credentials, implement password management, create a secure\\n\\nauthentication handshake, and so on.\\n\\n\\n[Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-wh\", \"atis) provides all these things and more out of the box. You store your\\n\\nuser identities in Azure Active Directory and have users authenticate against it,\\n\\nredirecting them to your application only after they are authenticated. Azure Active\\n\\nDirectory takes care of password management, including common scenarios like \\u201cI\\n\\nforgot my password.\\u201d Azure Active Directory is used by millions of applications every\\n\\nday, including the [Azure portal,](https://portal.azure.com/) [Outlook.com, and](https://outlook.live.com/owa/) [Office 365. Because of this, it is able](https://products.office.com/compare-all-microsoft-office-products)\\n\\nto more readily detect malicious behavior and act on it. For instance, if a user were to\\n\\nsign in to an application from a location in Europe and then one minute later sign in\\n\\nfrom Australia, Azure Active Directory would flag this as malicious behavior and ask the\\n\\nuser for additional credentials through multifactor authentication.\\n\\n\\n[To programmatically talk to Az\", \"ure Active Directory, you can use the Active Directory](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet)\\n\\n[Authenticating Library (ADAL) for .NET Framework and .NET Core.](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet)\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 21\\n\\n\\n#### Azure Key Vault\\n\\nIt is important to keep secrets such as passwords and connection strings out of source\\n\\ncode. So where do you put them? In [Azure Key Vault.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/)\\n\\n\\nAzure Key Vault is a safe place to store passwords, connection strings, access codes,\\n\\nand certificate keys. It is fully managed by Azure, so you don\\u2019t have to worry about\\n\\nthe underlying infrastructure. You just spin it up and use it.\\n\\n\\nYou can use it as a configuration store in your applications, just like you would use a\\n\\n**web.config** file. An administrator can populate the values in the Azure Key Vault, and\\n\\nyour application just pulls it out at startup time or w\", \"henever it needs it. This way,\\n\\npasswords will never be in source code and are the responsibility of the Azure Key Vault\\n\\nadministrator.\\n\\n\\n[You can use Azure Key Vault using the Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault) that\\n\\n[you can use from the .NET Framework and .NET Core. There is even a special syntax](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/simplifying-security-for-serverless-and-web-apps-with-azure-functions-and-app-service/)\\n\\nwhich allows pulling secrets from KeyVault in App Services with zero code changes. For\\n\\nmore complex scenarios where configuration changes based on location, release or\\n\\n[some other custom dimension Microsoft is introducing Azure App Configuration a](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday/Getting-started-with-Azure-App-Configuration)\\n\\nservice dedicated to providing a centralized configuration location which can be used\\n\\nfrom everything form App Services to a DevOps pipeline.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Managed Serv\", \"ice Identity\\n\\nEven when you use Azure Key Vault, your application must have some credentials in its\\n\\nconfiguration. Something that you use to connect to Azure Active Directory or to Azure\\n\\n[Key Vault. Well, it doesn\\u2019t have to anymore. You can now use Azure Managed Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/msi-overview)\\n\\n[Identity.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/msi-overview)\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 22\\n\\n\\nYou can use Managed Service Identity from a lot of services in Azure, including from\\n\\nAzure App Service. From there, you can enable it to inject credentials into your\\n\\napplication at runtime and use those credentials to access other services, like Azure Key\\n\\nVault.\\n\\n\\nYou can use the Managed Service Identity from the .NET Framework and .NET Core\\n\\n[using the Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication NuGet package.](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication)\\n\\n#### Azure Advisor\\n\\nThere are a lot of m\", \"oving parts in Azure so Microsoft provides a tool called Azure\\n\\n[Advisor which examines your Azure resources and makes recommendations. The](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/advisor/)\\n\\nrecommendations include how to save money by making more efficient use of Azure\\n\\nresources and suggestions on how to make your Azure resources more secure. The\\n\\nsecurity advisor will catch and rank problems like world readable Blob Storage and give\\n\\ninstructions on how to better secure your environment.\\n### Other Azure services\\n#### Enhance your application performance\\n\\nAzure can also help you to boost your applications\\u2019 performance. One service that helps\\n\\n[with this is Azure Redis Cache, which provides high-performance, in-memory, key-value](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache/)\\n\\n[storage. Another is Azure Content Delivery Network, or CDN, which can replicate your](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cdn/)\\n\\nstatic content, like images and video files to points-of-presence all over the\", \" world,\\n\\nmaking sure that it is as close to your users as possible. And finally, Azure Traffic\\n\\n[Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager/) can improve application responsiveness by routing users to locations with the\\n\\nlowest latency.\\n\\n#### Machine Learning\\n\\nAzure provides an industry leading suite of services that can make your application more\\n\\n[intelligent. Azure Cognitive Services are a suite of APIs that can do things which would](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/)\\n\\nbe nearly impossible using traditional programming approaches. You can quickly build\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 23\\n\\n\\napplications which can recognize faces, convert speech to text and understand the\\n\\n[meaning of text. Using the Language Understanding service you can create bots which](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/)\\n\\ncan intelligently respond to requests in Slack, Microsoft Teams and\", \" other forums.\\n\\nYou can also create your own machine learning algorithms with [Azure Machine Learning.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/data-science-and-machine-learning)\\n\\nTraining jobs created in popular tools such as Tensorflow can be submitted to run on a\\n\\ncluster of GPU-enabled Virtual Machines, vastly decreasing the time to train models.\\n\\n#### Internet of Things (IoT)\\n\\nWhen you are building a solution based on the Internet of Things, Azure can help you\\n\\n[with services like Azure IoT Hub, which can ingest massive amounts of messages from](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/)\\n\\n[IoT devices and manage the devices. Azure IoT Suite](https://azure.microsoft.com/suites/iot-suite/) makes it possible for you to\\n\\nmanage your IoT devices without doing everything yourself. And if you have limited IoT\\n\\n[experience, you can use Azure IoT Central, which is a SaaS solution that enables you to](https://www.microsoft.com/iot-central)\\n\\n[use\", \" IoT with minimal customization. And finally, there is Azure IoT Edge, which allows](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-edge/)\\n\\nIoT devices to do some of the calculations locally, instead of having to communicate\\n\\nwith the cloud for every operation. Trained ML models can even be deployed to edge\\n\\ndevices enabling capabilities such as image recognition in disconnected hardware.\\n\\n#### Data Analytics\\n\\n[There are many services in Azure for doing data analytics, including Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory/)\\n\\n[for moving and transforming data; Azure Analysis Services, which provides an in-](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/analysis-services/)\\n\\n[memory data analytics platform; and Azure Data Lake Analytics, which can perform U-](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-lake-analytics/)\\n\\n[SQL jobs on Azure Data Lake Store. You can also take advantage of Azure Stream](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-lake-store/)\\n\\n[Analytics to analyze dat\", \"a on the fly and Azure Time Series Insights, which provides a](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/)\\n\\nunique data analytics platform for time-based data that can store and analyze data and\\n\\ncan show information using its own data visualization engine. In addition, there is Azure\\n\\n[Databricks, which offers a managed cluster of enhanced Apache Spark\\u2013based analytics](https://databricks.com/azure)\\n\\n[engines, and Azure HDInsight, which you can use to spin up managed clusters of open-](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/)\\n\\n[source data analytics platforms and tools, like Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, and](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/storm/apache-storm-overview)\\n\\nApache HBase.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 24\\n\\n\\n#### Messaging\\n\\nAzure also provides services that can help you build scalable architectures with events\\n\\nand messages. [Azure Queue Storage and](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/queues/) [Azure Service Bus Topics](h\", \"ttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-how-to-use-topics-subscriptions) and [Queues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-get-started-with-queues) can help\\n\\nwith that by providing queuing mechanisms that decouple your services. Azure Event\\n\\n[Grid can help by subscribing to events, like blobs being added and pushing an event to](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/)\\n\\n[whoever is subscribed to it. And Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/) can ingest massive amounts of data,\\n\\nwhich you can process, filter, and store in your own time. Using messaging to\\n\\ncommunicate between services in Azure allows you to handle load smoothly while also\\n\\npreventing data loss in the event a service is unavailable.\\n\\n#### Media Services\\n\\n[Working with (streaming) media can be challenging. Azure Media Services can help you](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/)\\n\\n[by providing s\", \"ervices like encoding, which encodes your media files into the file formats](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/encoding/)\\n\\n[and screen sizes they need to be. Azure Content Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/content-protection/) enables you to use DRM\\n\\n[technologies like PlayReady](https://www.microsoft.com/playready/) to make sure that your content is only used by authorized\\n\\nusers. With [live streaming](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/media-services-manage-channels-overview) you can stream media worldwide at massive scale. And by\\n\\n[using Media Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/media-analytics/) you can enhance media by doing intelligent things like creating\\n\\nsubtitles for a movie based on speech.\\n\\n#### Monitoring\\n\\nAnd finally, you need to monitor your applications that run in Azure, to make sure that\\n\\nthey run smoothly. The monitoring tools in Azure fall under the umbrella of Azure\\n\\n[Monitor. T\", \"here are services like Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview) that can help you to monitor\\n\\nevery aspect of your application. There is also [Azure Log Analytics, which plugs into](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/log-analytics/)\\n\\nevery [Azure Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/network-watcher/) [to gather diagnostics information, and Azure Network Watcher,](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/network-watcher/)\\n\\n[which can inspect network traffic from your VMs and over your Virtual Networks.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview)\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 25\\n\\n\\n**Figure 1** A sample monitoring dashboard\\n\\n\\n[Visual Studio App Center provides logging and monitoring as part of a fully featured](https://www.visualstudio.com/app-center/)\\n\\n[suite of tools for mobile applications. Azure Security Center, which is your one-stop-](https://azure.micros\", \"oft.com/services/security-center/)\\n\\nshop for all the security aspects of all your services in Azure. Your logs can be visualized\\n\\n[using Azure Dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/tutorial-app-dashboards) or [Power BI and you can even trigger custom actions from log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualizations)\\n\\n[events using Logic Apps.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/automate-with-logic-apps)\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 26\\n\\n\\n### Tools for developing, debugging and troubleshooting\\n\\nAs .NET developers and architects, we are spoiled with the incredible tooling of Visual\\n\\nStudio. This extends into the world of Azure, which includes many tools that can make\\n\\ndeveloping and troubleshooting in Azure easier and fun. Let\\u2019s explore these tools.\\n\\n#### Visual Studio and Azure\\n\\nWe all love Visual Studio and Azure does too! If you run any version of Visual Studio\\n\\n2019 or 2017 and [enable the Azur\", \"e workload, you\\u2019ll be able to seamlessly work with](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/support/selecting-workloads-visual-studio-2017/)\\n\\nAzure. And if you can\\u2019t upgrade, that\\u2019s OK, we have you covered there, too. If you are\\n\\nusing Visual Studio 2015, you can download the Visual Studio 2015 Tools for Azure.\\n\\n\\n**Project templates**\\n\\n\\nOut of the box, you get lots of project templates to work with. You can create web\\n\\n[applications for the cloud, Azure Cloud Services applications, Azure Functions, Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cloud-services/)\\n\\n[WebJobs, and much more.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-create-web-jobs)\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 27\\n\\n\\n**Figure 2** : Azure project templates in Visual Studio 2019 with Azure workload installed\\n\\n#### Cloud Explorer\\n\\nAs part of the Azure workload in Visual Studio, you get Cloud Explorer. You can use this\\n\\nto navigate through all your Azure subscriptions and resources and take action, as in\\n\\nFig\", \"ure 3, where you can attach a debugger to an App Service Web App.\\n\\n\\nFrom Cloud Explorer, you can also do things like open an Azure SQL Database in the\\n\\nVisual Studio Server Explorer and upload files to Azure Storage.\\n\\n\\nYou can even connect to services to see their streaming logs and change application\\n\\nsettings and connection strings in App Service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 28\\n\\n\\n**Figure 3** : Cloud Explorer in Visual Studio\\n\\n#### Publish to Azure\\n\\n\\nOnce you have the Azure workload enabled in Visual Studio, you can easily publish to\\n\\nAzure from various project types. The publish wizard has an option to publish to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/)\\n\\n[App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) (for example, host a web site).

This is great, because now you can debug\\n\\nproduction without pausing the app when you hit a breakpoint. Debugging provides a\\n\\nlot more information than diagnostic logs typically do.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 31\\n\\n\\nNote that you do need Visual Studio En\", \"terprise to use the Snapshot Debugger. Here\\u2019s\\n\\nhow it works:\\n\\n\\n1. Attach the **snapshot debugger** to your application process in Azure.\\n\\n\\n2. Add a **snappoint** (different from a breakpoint).\\n\\n\\n3. When the **snappoint** is hit, a **snapshot** is taken.\\n\\n\\n  - The debugger quickly gathers all the information it needs about the call stack and\\n\\nvariables and lets the app continue to run.\\n\\n\\n4. You can now view the **snapshot** and inspect everything that you normally would\\n\\nwhen debugging, without holding up the application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Azure Storage Explorer\\n\\nThe [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) is a tool for managing your Azure Storage accounts. It\\u2019s a\\n\\n[free, standalone application from Microsoft that you can download here.

And when you\\u2019re done, you can publish them to Azure or use [continuous](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment)\\n\\n[integration and continuous delivery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment) to check your Azure Functions code and publish it\\n\\nautomatically to Azure.\\n\\n#### Cosmos DB Emulator\\n\\n[When you are using Azure Cosmos DB, you can use the Azure Cosmos DB Emula\", \"tor to](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/)\\n\\ndevelop locally. The emulator acts just like Cosmos DB would and even provides the\\n\\nsame interface as Cosmos DB does in the Azure portal.\\n\\n\\n**Figure 8:** Cosmos DB Emulator local interface\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 35\\n\\n\\nThe Cosmos DB Emulator also shows up in the Cloud Explorer in Visual Studio, so that\\n\\nyou can easily manage it from there.\\n\\n\\nBy developing locally against the Cosmos DB emulator, you can develop without\\n\\nincurring costs from a Cosmos DB in Azure. And when you are ready, you can deploy\\n\\nyour application to Azure and run it against Cosmos DB there, just by changing your\\n\\nconnection string.\\n\\n#### Azure DevOps for build and deployment\\n\\nOnce you are working on your application, it is vital to integrate your work with the work\\n\\nof other developers (continuous integration).\\n\\n\\n[It is vital to deploy that work to a central location, like an Azure Web App, so that you](https://azure.microsoft.com/servic\", \"es/app-service/web/)\\n\\ncan see that it works, and so that it can be tested and promoted through the different\\n\\nenvironments and can be deployed to production (continuous delivery).\\n\\n\\nTo make this work, you need to automatically integrate everybody\\u2019s work and deploy it.\\n\\nIdeally, you would do these things continuously, whenever somebody commits new\\n\\nwork.\\n\\n\\n[Azure DevOps, can help with that. It is an application lifecycle management system that](https://dev.azure.com/)\\n\\nmanages your work items and sprints, stores and manages your source code, builds\\n\\nyour code, and deploys it to wherever you want. The best part is, it is very easy to set up.\\n\\n\\n[You can put your source code in DevOps and manage it using the TFS or Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc?view=azure-devops) protocols.\\n\\nOnce you start committing changes, you can have those built by a simple build\\n\\n[pipeline that executes something like a Visual Studio build, just like you would on yo\", \"ur](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/build/visual-studio-build?view=azure-devops)\\n\\nlocal development computer. You can create such a pipeline by just adding tasks in\\n\\nthe DevOps portal, like in Figure 9.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 36\\n\\n\\n**Figure 9** : DevOps Build Pipeline\\n\\n\\nYou can set your build up to compile your code and run your unit tests every time\\n\\nsomebody commits. This is continuous integration.\\n\\n\\nAnd once the build is done, it can kick off a release pipeline that deploys your code to\\n\\nenvironments including development, test, staging, and production. You can deploy\\n\\nyour code to anywhere: to on-premises resources or to the cloud. You can even have\\n\\n[permissions gates](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/build-release/concepts/definitions/release/approvals/approvals) that require somebody like a product owner to approve the\\n\\ndeployment to production, putting them in control.\\n\\n\\nYou create a release pipeline in the same way as you crea\", \"te a build pipeline\\u2014by adding\\n\\ntasks in the Azure DevOps portal, like in Figure 10.\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 37\\n\\n\\n**Figure 10** : Azure DevOps Release Pipeline\\n\\n\\nAzure DevOps is a powerful tool that every .NET developer should have in their arsenal.\\n\\nNow you no longer have an excuse to not do continuous integration and continuous\\n\\ndeployment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 38\\n\\n\\n### Summary and how to get started for free\\n\\nIn this guide, we\\u2019ve introduced the power that Azure can bring to your applications.\\n\\nUsing Azure, you can do incredible things with your applications\\u2014facial and speech\\n\\nrecognition, manage your devices on the Internet of Things in the cloud, scale as much\\n\\nas you want, and pay for what you use.\\n\\n\\nYou\\u2019ve seen that Azure is a great place for .NET developers and architects and it\\n\\nprovides tools that have the same world-class quality and depth that you are used to\\n\\nworking with today.
