Written by developers for developers in the .NET ecosystem, this\\nguide will show you how to get started with Azure and which services you can use to run\\nyour .NET applications and store your data in a more efficient an\", \"d secure way.\\nBefore we dive in, let\\u2019s take a moment to see what the cloud, and Microsoft Azure in\\nparticular, can do for you.\\nWhat can Azure do for you?\\nAzure provides services that can help you accomplish many things. These range from\\nthe mundane\\u2014such as adding search functionality to your application or spinning up\\na new SQL database to connect to your recent .NET app\\u2014to more exotic projects\\nsuch as implementing continuous integration (CI) and\", \" continuous deployment (CD)\\nworkflows. You also can automatically tune your database or set up push notifications\\nto mobile devices, easily and quickly. These are just a few examples of some common\\nprojects that developers have repeatedly had to create for themselves but that are\\nnow available as a service. And you can use these services with little effort\\u2014almost\\nlike flipping a light switch! You can then focus on the pieces of your application t\", \"hat\\nmake it unique\\u2014the features that provide real added value for your users.\\nBesides services, Azure offers compute resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs),\\ncontainers, databases, web app services, and mobile services. You can use these to host\\napplications or to provide a complete infrastructure for your users, most of which you\\ncan do through Visual Studio.\\nThe power of the cloud is that services and resources are incredibly robust and\", \" resilient.\\nIt is very unlikely that they will fail to run, because the cloud is smart and self-healing.\\nWith Azure, there are datacenters all over the world, filled with tens of thousands of\\nservers. If one server fails, another takes over. If an entire datacenter were to fail (a highly\\nunlikely scenario), another would take over. All this is possible because of the massive\\nscale of the cloud.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 5One of \", \"the most compelling arguments in favor of the cloud is that you can scale up\\nyour services and resources almost infinitely, with just a few clicks of a button. You can\\u2019t\\ndo that with on-premises resources unless you\\u2019re prepared to spend enormous sums of\\nmoney on capital equipment which would remain largely idle and staff to administer it\\nall. You can scale globally without having to build data centers around the world by\\nputting your services any\", \"where in the world eliminating latency and providing a high-\\nperformance experience to your users, regardless of where they are. It also means that\\nyou can keep your data where you need it to be, observing data residency\\nrequirements.\\nEqually important, when you use cloud resources, you can scale back your services and\\nresources when there is no longer high demand. This allows you to scale up and down\\neven during the course of a normal day keepin\", \"g applications economical and\\nperformant.\\nIn addition to massive scalability, off-the-shelf intelligent services, and pay-per-use\\nefficiency, the cloud offers increased security. The cloud is used by millions of people,\\n24x7, worldwide. Of course, it is also attacked by many people. Reputable and\\nexperienced cloud providers like Microsoft recognize the usage patterns of normal users\\nand those of malicious actors. This means we know how to protect\", \" against both the\\nmost common and most unique attacks out there. Intelligent monitoring tools, machine\\nlearning algorithms, and artificial intelligence give cloud providers the ability to detect\\nattacks in real time and stop them in their tracks.\\nDecades of experience in security and massive-scale traffic, combined with top industry\\nsecurity expertise, make the cloud a much more secure environment than any on-\\npremises datacenter.\\nMore info\\nTo re\", \"ad more about how Azure secures your applications and data, read the official Azure\\nSecurity blog, A zure Security Overview, and how to get started with Azure Security\\n.\\nWe\\u2019ve briefly explored reasons to begin your migration to the cloud and Microsoft Azure.\\nNow, let\\u2019s examine which Azure services are useful for you for running and securing your\\napplications and storing your data.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 6Getting Started with \", \"Azure services\\nLet\\u2019s explore some of the services that you can use for running your applications in\\nAzure, storing your data in Azure, and securing your application with Azure.\\nRunning your .NET applications in Azure\\nOne of the first decisions that you need to make when you start with Azure is which\\nservice(s) to use to run your applications in Azure. There are many options. Let\\u2019s start by\\nlaying out which Azure services are most suitable for whi\", \"ch application types in Table 1.\\nTable 1: Which Azure services are best suited for which types of applications?\\nApp Service Azure\\nApp Service Azure Virtual Container\\nMobile Logic Apps Kubernetes\\nWeb Apps Functions Machines Instances\\nApps Service (AKS)\\nMonolithic *\\nand N-Tier\\napplications\\n*\\nMobile app\\nback end\\nMicroservice\\narchitecture-\\nbased\\napplications\\nBusiness process\\norchestrations\\nand workflows\\n* For lifting and shifting existing application\", \"s to Azure.\\nAzure App Services\\nOne of the easiest and most powerful ways to host your applications in Azure is in Azure\\nApp Service. Azure App Service is a group of services that takes care of hosting your\\napplication and abstracting away the complexities of the operating system and\\ninfrastructure. They are highly available by default and will stay up and running for at\\nleast 99.95% of the time.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 7They s\", \"hare powerful features like automatic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and\\neasy authentication and authorization. They also allow you to debug your application\\nwhile it is running in production (with the Snapshot Debugger) and work very well with\\nApplication Insights, which you can use to monitor every aspect of your app, from\\nperformance to usage.\\nThere are several different types of App Service apps.\\nAzure Web Apps\\nRunning a .NET web applica\", \"tion in Azure is very easy in Azure Web Apps. Web Apps act\\nas a web server as a service, like IIS. And you can simply deploy your ASP.NET or\\nASP.NET Core application with Visual Studio to Web Apps and run it. These can be\\nwebsites, APIs, or any other HTTP-driven application including Node.js, Python and Java\\napplications.\\nOnce your application runs in an App Service web app, you can scale it up or down, add\\neasy authentication, use deployment slo\", \"ts, enable continuous deployment, and use any\\nof the other App Service features. By default, your application is available on the\\ninternet, without you needing to set up a domain name or configure DNS settings,\\nalthough you can do that.\\nTry it now - G et started by creating an ASP.NET Core web app in Azure\\nContainers on App Services\\nDevelopers who want the power of App Services but need to maintain a higher level of\\ncontrol over their environment\", \"s can also run containers. Both Linux and Windows\\ncontainers are supported. You can deploy your own containers from the Azure\\nContainer Registry, a private Docker registry or public containers from the Docker Hub.\\nThis allows you to run a wide range of pre-configured applications from WordPress to\\nRedis which can be deployed either as single containers or as part of a multi-container\\napplication. Windows container support also helps you migrate e\", \"xisting ASP.NET apps\\nand WCF services that need access to the Windows OS, install custom components, or\\nuse the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 8Azure Mobile Apps\\nIf you are building mobile applications, you will need a back end that the mobile app\\nconnects to. Usually, this is some sort of API that your app can use to retrieve and store\\ndata. Azure Mobile Apps provides you with such a back end. You can wr\", \"ite it in C# or\\nuse any of the Quickstart applications.\\nA mobile back end that runs in Azure Mobile Apps provides unique capabilities. For\\ninstance, you can use offline sync, which enables the mobile app to continue working\\nwhen there is no connection to the back end and sync changes once the connection is\\nrestored. And with push notifications you can send notifications to the mobile apps\\nusing C# code, regardless of the platform it runs on (iOS,\", \" Android, Windows). In addition\\nto these unique features, Mobile Apps shares all the other features of Azure App Service.\\nGet started by creating an Android app with an Azure mobile app back end.\\nAzure Functions (also known as serverless compute)\\nAzure Function apps enable you to create Azure Functions in C# and many other\\nlanguages in Visual Studio and other IDEs and editors. Each Functions app contains one\\nor more Azure Functions and provides i\", \"ntegration with authentication and deployment\\nslots.\\nThe Azure Functions that run in Azure Function apps are small pieces of code that you\\nwrite, without you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or about scaling.\\nMany refer to this deployment model as Functions as a Service (FaaS).\\nFunction applications can be simply triggered by a wide variety of events originating\\nboth inside and outside of Azure. HTTP triggers allow web requests\", \" to be served by a\\nfunction app. Event Grid events can trigger Azure Functions when changes are made to\\nAzure resources such as the container registry and virtual machines.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 9Here is an example: You write an Azure Functions app that executes every time a new\\nimage file is uploaded to Azure Storage. You then take that image, rename it, and\\noutput it to another Azure Storage account.\\nThis is very easy to d\", \"o. You just write the code to rename the image. Azure Functions\\ntakes care of getting the input image when the function is triggered. And it takes care of\\nwriting the image to the other storage account. It takes care of all the plumbing, and\\nyou just write the code.\\nAzure Functions even handles scaling for you. So it doesn\\u2019t matter if there are 1,000\\nimages that trigger the function at the same time. Azure Functions transparently spins up\\nmore fu\", \"nctions to deal with it and they go away when the code is done executing.\\nBecause of this, you only pay for the code that you execute, not for a service that runs all\\nthe time, waiting to be triggered.\\nAzure Functions are great for executing small pieces of code that perform one or two\\nsteps on an input and an output. If you want to perform more steps of a larger process,\\nyou can use Durable Functions.\\nDurable Functions provide a stateful experie\", \"nce on top of a series of Azure Functions.\\nThey enable complex patterns such as scatter/gather and function chaining. A Durable\\nFunction orchestration may be as simple as coupling together two functions, one after\\nanother, or as complex as coordinating tens of thousands of function calls over weeks.\\nGet started by creating your first Azure Function with Visual Studio\\n.\\nAzure Logic Apps\\nDurable Functions are a fantastic orchestration tool for deve\", \"lopers who are comfortable\\nwith writing every step of the process inside a series of Functions. For those looking for\\na lower code solution Logic Applications may be better. With Azure Logic Apps, you can\\norchestrate a process just by weaving API calls together in a visual designer in Visual\\nStudio or the Azure portal. Visual Studio offers a specific Logic Apps project template to\\nget started.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 10A logic\", \" app has a trigger, just like an Azure function does. This can be an outside trigger,\\nlike when a new blob is added, or a certain text is tweeted. Or it can be a manual trigger\\nor a trigger on a schedule such as every 15 minutes.\\nOnce triggered, a logic app takes its input and calls APIs with it to complete a process.\\nYou just click this together by choosing APIs from a large list of available ones and\\nchoosing the input and output for those APIs\", \". Azure Functions can also be used for APIs\\nin a logic app. And you can use your own ASP.NET Core APIs.\\nHere\\u2019s an e xample :\\nA logic app gets triggered by a new blob that is written in Azure Blob storage . It takes the\\nBlob input, which is an image file, and resizes the image by calling an Azure function that\\ndoes just that. Next, it takes the resized image and writes it to another storage account.\\nAnd finally, it calls the O ffice 365 AP I to se\", \"nd an email to the administrator that there is a\\nnew, resized image available .\\nJust like Azure functions, logic apps scale automatically, you just create the process. It will trigger as\\nmany times as it is needed and always executes the complete process and has reliability features, like\\nretry policies, built in. And because it only runs when it is triggered, you only pay for when it runs\\u2014you\\ndon\\u2019t pay for owning it.\\nGet started by building your\", \" first logic app workflow in the Azure porta l .\\nNote: Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions work very well with the Azure Event Grid service. Event Grid allows you to\\nsubscribe to events, like when something happens in your application, and to push that information as an event that can\\ntrigger a Logic App or an Azure Function.\\nAzure Virtual Machines\\nA very different way of running your application is by taking advantage of Azure Virtual\\nMachines.\", \" This is an easy way to get started, because you can lift-and-shift existing\\napplications from virtual machines that you run in your datacenter to VMs that run in\\nAzure. There are many predefined VM images that you can use, like Windows Server\\n2019 that runs IIS and has ASP.NET installed and preconfigured on it. You can even\\nbring your own software licenses if you already have one (like for SQL Server).\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers\", \" 11Running your application in a VM doesn\\u2019t provide you the features like zero-downtime\\ndeployments and easy authentication. You are also responsible for patching the\\noperating system and for making sure that antivirus software is up to date.\\nOn the other hand, it does provide you with the ability to easily scale your VM to a\\nbigger size or automatically scale it down when it isn\\u2019t used that much. Virtual Machine\\nScale Sets allow for scaling out \", \"VMs to a large number of nodes and load balancing\\nwork between them. And it offers you the reliability of running something in Azure. It is\\nvery unlikely that your VM will stop running, and Microsoft guarantees this uptime with\\na comprehensive SLA.\\nAnd if you\\u2019re not ready to run your production VMs in Azure you can still take\\nadvantage of streamlined DevOps and testing with Azure DevTest Labs.\\nGet started by Creating a Windows virtual machine wit\", \"h the Azure porta. l\\nA word about microservices and containers\\nYou can run your applications in containers, which are very lightweight and start and\\nstop in seconds. Containers isolate your application and its dependencies in a way that\\nguarantees that you\\u2019ll never run into library version conflicts. They can be based on\\nnumerous popular Linux distributions or Windows Server so no matter the platform your\\napplication uses it can run in a containe\", \"r.\\nA popular approach for containers is to use them to run a microservices architecture.\\nThis means that you create many small, isolated, services that each have their own\\nfunction and each have separate development and deployment lifecycles. Containers\\ncan also be used to lift and shift existing applications to run at scale in the cloud.\\nAzure provides several services to support running a microservices architecture in\\ncontainers. Running the in\", \"creasingly popular orchestration engine Kubernetes, Azure\\nKubernetes Service (AKS) provides a powerful tool to run anything from a handful of\\ncontainers to hundreds of thousands of them. AKS can all run and orchestrate\\ncontainers. Orchestration of containers is quite different from orchestrating a process,\\nlike Logic Apps does. Orchestrating containers means that you manage their lifecycles.\\nProvision new ones, scale up or down, manage failures, \", \"and so on.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 12You can learn more about microservices by reading:\\n.NET Microservices Architecture Guidance\\nWhich frameworks and technologies can you use in which Azure service?\\nNow that you know what the options are for running your application in Azure, it is\\nextremely useful to know which version of .NET you can run in these services and what\\nkind of containers they support. Table 2 explains this by sho\", \"wing which framework and\\ncontainer types you can use in which services in Azure.\\nTable 2: Which framework and technology can you use in which Azure service\\nAzure\\nAzure\\nMobile Kubernetes\\nWeb Apps Functions Azure VMs Container\\nApps Service\\nInstance\\n(AKS)\\n.NET Framework\\napps\\n.NET Core apps\\nLinux Containers\\nWindows Server\\nContainers\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 13Storing your data in Azure\\nData is a particularly important aspect of any\", \" modern .NET application, and it comes in\\nall shapes and sizes. Azure provides many types of data stores that can help you\\nmaintain and retrieve data in any scenario.\\nTable 3 shows which data service to use for which scenario.\\nDatabase Cosmos DB Blob Table File\\nPostgre SQL, SQL Data Data Lake\\nMySQL Warehouse Store\\nRelational data\\nUnstructured\\ndata\\nSemistructured\\ndata\\nFiles on disk\\nStore large data\\nStore small\\ndata\\nGeographic\\ndata\\nreplication\\nTuna\", \"ble data\\nconsistency\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 14Azure SQL Database\\nIf you are familiar with .NET, you will likely be familiar with SQL Server. In Azure, you can\\nrun your SQL Server workload in Azure SQL Database. This is SQL Server in the cloud. It\\nis the same thing that you run on-premises but it offers a lot of advantages.\\nYou can do (almost) everything with it that you can do with on-premises SQL Server.\\nAnd, in fact, new SQ\", \"L Server features are incorporated in Azure SQL Database first and\\nlater in the on-premises SQL Server.\\nYou can use Azure SQL Databases with your favorite tools, like Azure Data Studio, Server\\nExplorer and SQL Server Data Tools in Visual Studio and SQL Server Management\\nStudio.\\nBecause they run in the cloud, Azure SQL Databases are fully managed, scalable, and\\nhigh performing. They are automatically backed up and have many advanced features,\\nsuch\", \" as:\\n\\u2022 Single-click Geo-replication, which replicates data to other geographical regions in\\nreal time, incredibly easily. (Get started with geo-replication.)\\n\\u2022 Dynamic data masking, which masks sensitive data for certain users at runtime.\\n(Get started with dynamic data masking.)\\n\\u2022 Auditing, which provides a complete audit trail of all the actions that happen to the\\ndata. (Get started with Azure SQL Database auditing.)\\n\\u2022 Automatic database tuning,\", \" which monitors the performance of your database and\\ntunes it automatically. (Get started with Azure SQL Database automatic tuning.)\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 15In addition to all these features, Azure SQL Databases are exceptionally reliable by\\ndefault. Without configuring anything, transaction log backups are made every 5-10\\nminutes and differential backups every 12 hours. These backups are stored three times\\nin the local data\", \"center and three times in another datacenter. And you can restore\\nbackups from 35 days ago, depending on the pricing tier that you use.\\nIt is very easy to use Azure SQL Databases from a .NET application. You can, for instance,\\nuse the Entity Framework (or Entity Framework Core) to access the database and write\\nand read data to and from it. For the most part accessing data programmatically is no\\ndifferent from accessing data in an on-premises SQL \", \"Server.\\nGet started by creating an Azure SQL Database in the Azure Porta. l\\nAzure Cosmos DB\\nAzure Cosmos DB is a new kind of database that is globally distributed and cloud native.\\nHere are some of its key features:\\n\\u2022 A 99.99% SLA (99.999% for read operations) that includes low latencies (less than 10\\nms on reads; less than 15 ms on writes).\\n\\u2022 Geo-replication, which replicates data to other geographical regions in real time\\n(How to distribute dat\", \"a globally with Azure Cosmos DB).\\n\\u2022 Tunable data consistency levels, so you can choose data consistency, enabling a\\ntruly globally distributed data system. You can, for instance, choose strong\\nconsistency, eventual consistency, or session consistency.\\n\\u2022 Traffic management, which sends users to the data replica to which they are closest.\\n\\u2022 Limitless global scale. You pay only for the throughput and storage that you need.\\n\\u2022 Automatic indexing of da\", \"ta. No need to maintain or tune the database anymore.\\nIn addition to all these features, Cosmos DB offers different APIs with which you can\\nstore and retrieve data, including SQL, Gremlin, MongoDB, Azure Table Storage, and\\nApache Cassandra. Different APIs handle data in different ways. You can use documents\\nas data as well as unstructured tables, graphs, and blobs. You use the API that fits your\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 16needs\", \", and Cosmos DB takes care of the rest. If your application already uses one of\\nthese protocols switching to Cosmos DB is as simple as changing a connection string.\\nYou benefit from cloud-grade performance, scalability, and reliability, and still use the\\nprogramming model to which you\\u2019re accustomed.\\nYou can use Cosmos DB from .NET Framework and .NET Core. For example, you can use\\nits SQL API through the NuGet package Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB or\", \"\\nMicrosoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core (for .NET Core).\\nGet started with Azure Cosmos DB with the SQL API and .NET Cor.e\\nAzure Storage\\nWith Azure Storage, one of the most fundamental services in Azure, you can store data\\nin different forms. It is easy to use, fast, and inexpensive. Azure Storage offers several\\ntypes of storage that you can use for different scenarios. All these storage types share\\ncommon features like encryption for data at rest, secur\", \"ity through shared access\\nsignatures, and firewalls and virtual networks.\\nAzure Storage is also very reliable. By default, data is replicated three times within the\\ndatacenter. You can also choose geo-replicated storage, which, in addition to the three\\nlocal replicas, replicates the data three times to another datacenter. You can create your\\napplication in such a manner that it reads from this geo-replicated data, which is close\\nto your users, so\", \" that it is geographically high performing.\\nYou can use Azure Storage from your .NET Framework and .NET Core applications by\\nusing the WindowsAzure.Storage NuGet package and referencing the specific API that\\nyou need, like Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob (for Blob storage) in a using\\nstatement in your code.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 17Let\\u2019s explore the different types of Azure Storage:\\nFile Storage\\nAzure File storage uses th\", \"e SMB protocol, which makes it very suitable for lifting and\\nshifting your file server into the cloud. When you have files in Azure Files, you can mount\\nan Azure file share to a VM or even to your own Windows machine, to use as external\\nstorage.\\nGet started with Azure Files.\\nAzure Disk Storage is a similar service to Azure File but is dedicated to a single machine.\\nIt is available in four different performance levels from Standard HDD to Ultra SS\", \"D. The\\nhigh performance tiers are suitable for heavy I/O workloads such as running SAP HANA\\nor complex analytical models.\\nTable Storage\\nAzure Table storage is an inexpensive and extremely fast NoSQL key-value store that\\nyou can use to store data in flexible tables. A table can contain one row describing an\\norder and another row describing customer information. You don\\u2019t need to define a\\ndata schema. This makes Table Storage very flexible.\\nGet sta\", \"rted with Azure Table storage.\\nBlob Storage\\nYou can use Azure Blob storage to store large unstructured data\\u2014literally, blobs of data.\\nThis can be video, image, audio, text, or even virtual hard drive (VHD) files for VMs.\\nAdditionally, you can use Blob tiers to reduce your storage costs. By default, blobs are\\nwritten to the hot tier, which means that they are written and read very fast. You can\\nalso put blobs in the cool tier if you have data that\", \" is infrequently accessed and stored\\nfor at least 30 days. The cool tier is less expensive than the hot tier. And finally, you can\\nstore blobs in the archive tier, that is the least expensive. The archive tier is for data\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 18that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days. Reading data from the archive\\ntier can take hours. Blob tiering is a great way to save costs if you are storing large\\namount\", \"s of data.\\nGet started with Azure Blob storage.\\nQueue Storage\\nAzure Queue storage is an unusual type of storage in that it is used to store small\\nmessages of data, but its main purpose is to serve as a queue. You put messages on the\\nqueue and other processes pick it up. This pattern decouples the message sender from\\nthe message processor and results in performance and reliability benefits. Azure Queue\\nstorage is similar to Microsoft Message Queui\", \"ng that you can find in Windows.\\nGet started with Azure Queue storage.\\n|Note: Azure Service Bus Topics and Queues also provide queuing mechanisms, with slightly different properties than Azure Storage\\nqueues.\\nAzure Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB\\nAs a .NET developer, you encounter many different open-source database types in your\\njob. Some of them can now be used in a managed version in Azure.\\nAzure provides MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Ma\", \"riaDB databases as managed databases,\\nwhich means that you just spin them up and don\\u2019t have to worry about any of the\\nunderlying infrastructure. Just like Azure SQL Databases and Cosmos DB, these\\ndatabases are universally available, scalable, highly secure, and fully managed.\\nEach of these is suited for slightly different use cases, but in general, their functionality\\noverlaps a lot. You would use Azure Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaD\", \"B\\nwhen you are already using one of their on-premises versions and want the advantage\\nof having that run fully managed in the cloud. Migrating apps that use these databases\\nis much easier when the data can remain in its original platform. Azure also provides an\\nout of the box backend for services like WordPress which rely on open source databases.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 19Get started with Azure Database for MySQL by creating \", \"a MySQL serve r\\nby using the Azure portal .\\nAzure SQL Data Warehouse and Azure Data Lake Store\\nSince we are talking about storing data in Azure, we can\\u2019t leave out the data stores for\\nbig data and data analytics. These are not typical stores that you use with your\\napplication, but rather stores that you use for data analytics and reporting.\\nAzure provides two data stores that are very suitable for storing large amounts of data\\nfor data analytics \", \"purposes: the Azure SQL Data Warehouse and the Azure Data Lake\\nStore.\\nEach of these can hold petabytes of data. In fact, Azure Data Lake Store doesn\\u2019t even\\nhave limits on the amount of data and the file sizes that you can store.\\nYou use Azure SQL Data Warehouse when you know the questions that you want to\\nanswer with data analytics. You define a data schema that determines what your data\\nwill look like and how it can be used.\\nYou use Azure Data L\", \"ake Store when you don\\u2019t know the questions that you want to\\nanswer yet. You do not have to define a data schema for the Data Lake Store. You store\\ndata in its native format.\\nYou can work with each of these data stores with tools in Visual Studio. And you can use\\nany SQL tool, like SQL Server Management Studio, to work with Azure SQL Data\\nWarehouse. You can even create eye-popping business intelligence dashboards and\\nreports as a non-developer in\", \" Power BI.\\nAdditionally, you can use the Azure Management SDK for .NET to perform management\\noperations on these services. You can, for instance, create a new Data Lake Store\\naccount.\\nGet started with Azure SQL Data Warehouse by creating and quer y\\na warehouse in the Azure porta.l\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 20Get started with Azure Data Lake Store using the Azure porta. l\\nSecuring your .NET applications in Azure\\nBesides running y\", \"our application and storing data, you need to secure it. Azure can help\\nyou with that by providing authentication and authorization through Azure Active\\nDirectory and by helping you to keep secrets safe with Azure Key Vault and inserting\\ncredentials into your application with Managed Service Identity. Let\\u2019s examine these\\nservices.\\nAzure Active Directory\\nAn important part of your application\\u2019s security is authenticating users before they can\\nuse i\", \"t. Authentication is not an easy thing to implement. You need to store user\\nidentities and credentials, implement password management, create a secure\\nauthentication handshake, and so on.\\nAzure Active Directory provides all these things and more out of the box. You store your\\nuser identities in Azure Active Directory and have users authenticate against it,\\nredirecting them to your application only after they are authenticated. Azure Active\\nDirect\", \"ory takes care of password management, including common scenarios like \\u201cI\\nforgot my password.\\u201d Azure Active Directory is used by millions of applications every\\nday, including the Azure portal, Outlook.com, and Office 365. Because of this, it is able\\nto more readily detect malicious behavior and act on it. For instance, if a user were to\\nsign in to an application from a location in Europe and then one minute later sign in\\nfrom Australia, Azure Act\", \"ive Directory would flag this as malicious behavior and ask the\\nuser for additional credentials through multifactor authentication.\\nTo programmatically talk to Azure Active Directory, you can use the Active Directory\\nAuthenticating Library (ADAL) for .NET Framework and .NET Core.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 21Get started by integrating Azure AD into an ASP.NET Core web ap.p\\nAzure Key Vault\\nIt is important to keep secrets such as p\", \"asswords and connection strings out of source\\ncode. So where do you put them? In Azure Key Vault.\\nAzure Key Vault is a safe place to store passwords, connection strings, access codes,\\nand certificate keys. It is fully managed by Azure, so you don\\u2019t have to worry about\\nthe underlying infrastructure. You just spin it up and use it.\\nYou can use it as a configuration store in your applications, just like you would use a\\nweb.config file. An administra\", \"tor can populate the values in the Azure Key Vault, and\\nyour application just pulls it out at startup time or whenever it needs it. This way,\\npasswords will never be in source code and are the responsibility of the Azure Key Vault\\nadministrator.\\nYou can use Azure Key Vault using the Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault NuGet package that\\nyou can use from the .NET Framework and .NET Core. There is even a special syntax\\nwhich allows pulling secrets from KeyVau\", \"lt in App Services with zero code changes. For\\nmore complex scenarios where configuration changes based on location, release or\\nsome other custom dimension Microsoft is introducing Azure App Configuration a\\nservice dedicated to providing a centralized configuration location which can be used\\nfrom everything form App Services to a DevOps pipeline.\\nGet Started by using Azure Key Vault from an ASP.NET applicatio. n\\nManaged Service Identity\\nEven when\", \" you use Azure Key Vault, your application must have some credentials in its\\nconfiguration. Something that you use to connect to Azure Active Directory or to Azure\\nKey Vault. Well, it doesn\\u2019t have to anymore. You can now use Azure Managed Service\\nIdentity.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 22You can use Managed Service Identity from a lot of services in Azure, including from\\nAzure App Service. From there, you can enable it to inject cre\", \"dentials into your\\napplication at runtime and use those credentials to access other services, like Azure Key\\nVault.\\nYou can use the Managed Service Identity from the .NET Framework and .NET Core\\nusing the Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication NuGet package.\\nGet started by using Key Vault from App Service wit h\\nManaged Service Identity.\\nAzure Advisor\\nThere are a lot of moving parts in Azure so Microsoft provides a tool called Azure\\nAdvisor wh\", \"ich examines your Azure resources and makes recommendations. The\\nrecommendations include how to save money by making more efficient use of Azure\\nresources and suggestions on how to make your Azure resources more secure. The\\nsecurity advisor will catch and rank problems like world readable Blob Storage and give\\ninstructions on how to better secure your environment.\\nOther Azure services\\nEnhance your application performance\\nAzure can also help you t\", \"o boost your applications\\u2019 performance. One service that helps\\nwith this is Azure Redis Cache, which provides high-performance, in-memory, key-value\\nstorage. Another is Azure Content Delivery Network, or CDN, which can replicate your\\nstatic content, like images and video files to points-of-presence all over the world,\\nmaking sure that it is as close to your users as possible. And finally, Azure Traffic\\nManager can improve application responsivene\", \"ss by routing users to locations with the\\nlowest latency.\\nMachine Learning\\nAzure provides an industry leading suite of services that can make your application more\\nintelligent. Azure Cognitive Services are a suite of APIs that can do things which would\\nbe nearly impossible using traditional programming approaches. You can quickly build\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 23applications which can recognize faces, convert speech to text and\", \" understand the\\nmeaning of text. Using the Language Understanding service you can create bots which\\ncan intelligently respond to requests in Slack, Microsoft Teams and other forums.\\nYou can also create your own machine learning algorithms with Azure Machine Learning.\\nTraining jobs created in popular tools such as Tensorflow can be submitted to run on a\\ncluster of GPU-enabled Virtual Machines, vastly decreasing the time to train models.\\nInternet o\", \"f Things (IoT)\\nWhen you are building a solution based on the Internet of Things, Azure can help you\\nwith services like Azure IoT Hub, which can ingest massive amounts of messages from\\nIoT devices and manage the devices. Azure IoT Suite makes it possible for you to\\nmanage your IoT devices without doing everything yourself. And if you have limited IoT\\nexperience, you can use Azure IoT Central, which is a SaaS solution that enables you to\\nuse IoT wi\", \"th minimal customization. And finally, there is Azure IoT Edge, which allows\\nIoT devices to do some of the calculations locally, instead of having to communicate\\nwith the cloud for every operation. Trained ML models can even be deployed to edge\\ndevices enabling capabilities such as image recognition in disconnected hardware.\\nData Analytics\\nThere are many services in Azure for doing data analytics, including Azure Data Factory\\nfor moving and trans\", \"forming data; Azure Analysis Services, which provides an in-\\nmemory data analytics platform; and Azure Data Lake Analytics, which can perform U-\\nSQL jobs on Azure Data Lake Store. You can also take advantage of Azure Stream\\nAnalytics to analyze data on the fly and Azure Time Series Insights, which provides a\\nunique data analytics platform for time-based data that can store and analyze data and\\ncan show information using its own data visualization\", \" engine. In addition, there is Azure\\nDatabricks, which offers a managed cluster of enhanced Apache Spark\\u2013based analytics\\nengines, and Azure HDInsight, which you can use to spin up managed clusters of open-\\nsource data analytics platforms and tools, like Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, and\\nApache HBase.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 24Messaging\\nAzure also provides services that can help you build scalable architectures with events\\nand me\", \"ssages. Azure Queue Storage and Azure Service Bus Topics and Queues can help\\nwith that by providing queuing mechanisms that decouple your services. Azure Event\\nGrid can help by subscribing to events, like blobs being added and pushing an event to\\nwhoever is subscribed to it. And Azure Event Hubs can ingest massive amounts of data,\\nwhich you can process, filter, and store in your own time. Using messaging to\\ncommunicate between services in Azure a\", \"llows you to handle load smoothly while also\\npreventing data loss in the event a service is unavailable.\\nMedia Services\\nWorking with (streaming) media can be challenging. Azure Media Services can help you\\nby providing services like encoding, which encodes your media files into the file formats\\nand screen sizes they need to be. Azure Content Protection enables you to use DRM\\ntechnologies like PlayReady to make sure that your content is only used b\", \"y authorized\\nusers. With live streaming you can stream media worldwide at massive scale. And by\\nusing Media Analytics you can enhance media by doing intelligent things like creating\\nsubtitles for a movie based on speech.\\nMonitoring\\nAnd finally, you need to monitor your applications that run in Azure, to make sure that\\nthey run smoothly. The monitoring tools in Azure fall under the umbrella of Azure\\nMonitor. There are services like Azure Applicati\", \"on Insights that can help you to monitor\\nevery aspect of your application. There is also Azure Log Analytics, which plugs into\\nevery Azure Service to gather diagnostics information, and Azure Network Watcher,\\nwhich can inspect network traffic from your VMs and over your Virtual Networks.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 25Figure 1 A sample monitoring dashboard\\nVisual Studio App Center provides logging and monitoring as part of a fully \", \"featured\\nsuite of tools for mobile applications. Azure Security Center, which is your one-stop-\\nshop for all the security aspects of all your services in Azure. Your logs can be visualized\\nusing Azure Dashboards or Power BI and you can even trigger custom actions from log\\nevents using Logic Apps.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 26Tools for developing, debugging\\nand troubleshooting\\nAs .NET developers and architects, we are spoiled with\", \" the incredible tooling of Visual\\nStudio. This extends into the world of Azure, which includes many tools that can make\\ndeveloping and troubleshooting in Azure easier and fun. Let\\u2019s explore these tools.\\nVisual Studio and Azure\\nWe all love Visual Studio and Azure does too! If you run any version of Visual Studio\\n2019 or 2017 and enable the Azure workload, you\\u2019ll be able to seamlessly work with\\nAzure. And if you can\\u2019t upgrade, that\\u2019s OK, we have yo\", \"u covered there, too. If you are\\nusing Visual Studio 2015, you can download the Visual Studio 2015 Tools for Azure.\\nProject templates\\nOut of the box, you get lots of project templates to work with. You can create web\\napplications for the cloud, Azure Cloud Services applications, Azure Functions, Azure\\nWebJobs, and much more.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 27Figure 2: Azure project templates in Visual Studio 2019 with Azure workload i\", \"nstalled\\nCloud Explorer\\nAs part of the Azure workload in Visual Studio, you get Cloud Explorer. You can use this\\nto navigate through all your Azure subscriptions and resources and take action, as in\\nFigure 3, where you can attach a debugger to an App Service Web App.\\nFrom Cloud Explorer, you can also do things like open an Azure SQL Database in the\\nVisual Studio Server Explorer and upload files to Azure Storage.\\nYou can even connect to services t\", \"o see their streaming logs and change application\\nsettings and connection strings in App Service.\\nG et started by managing your Azure resources with Cloud Explore. r\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 28Figure 3: Cloud Explorer in Visual Studio\\nPublish to Azure\\nOnce you have the Azure workload enabled in Visual Studio, you can easily publish to\\nAzure from various project types. The publish wizard has an option to publish to Azure\\nApp Ser\", \"vice (for example, host a web site). Or you can directly publish to specific\\nservices like Azure Cloud Services. All with a few clicks.\\nGet started by using the Visual Studio Publish Azure Application wizar.d\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 29Figure 4: Publish to Azure\\nFor a more repeatable process you can set up an Azure DevOps pipeline from inside\\nVisual Studio 2019 which will build, test, and deploy your application to Azure. The\\nP\", \"ipeline will be kicked off every time there is a check-in to your source control ensuring\\nyour application is always up to date.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 30Figure 5: Configure a DevOps Pipeline\\nSnapshot Debugger\\nThe Snapshot Debugger allows you to debug your application while it is running live in\\nproduction, without affecting its performance. This is great, because now you can debug\\nproduction without pausing the app when you \", \"hit a breakpoint. Debugging provides a\\nlot more information than diagnostic logs typically do.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 31Note that you do need Visual Studio Enterprise to use the Snapshot Debugger. Here\\u2019s\\nhow it works:\\n1. Attach the snapshot debugger to your application process in Azure.\\n2. Add a snappoint (different from a breakpoint).\\n3. When the snappoint is hit, a snapshot is taken.\\n\\u2022 The debugger quickly gathers all the i\", \"nformation it needs about the call stack and\\nvariables and lets the app continue to run.\\n4. You can now view the snapshot and inspect everything that you normally would\\nwhen debugging, without holding up the application.\\nGet started by debugging snapshots on exceptions in .NET app. s\\nAzure Storage Explorer\\nThe Azure Storage Explorer is a tool for managing your Azure Storage accounts. It\\u2019s a\\nfree, standalone application from Microsoft that you can\", \" download here. You can use it\\nto create new blob containers, upload files, query through Table storage, and more.\\nYou can even use it to manage your Cosmos DB storage and create databases and\\ncollections.\\nGet started with Storage Explore.r\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 32Figure 6: Storage Explorer\\nAzure Storage Emulator\\nIn the Visual Studio Azure workload or in the Azure SDK, you\\u2019ll find the Azure storage\\nemulator, which you can us\", \"e to develop locally against Azure Storage. You can access it\\nthrough Cloud Explorer just like you can access it in the Azure portal or through other\\ntools such as Storage Explorer.\\nThe Azure storage emulator works the same as Azure Storage in the cloud, including\\nhow you authenticate to it. There are some obvious differences, like file size limitations\\nand the lack of geo-redundant scaling. And the emulator doesn\\u2019t support Azure Files.\\nOnce you \", \"are done developing and testing locally, you can publish your application to\\nthe cloud and use Azure Storage there.\\nGet started by configuring and using the storage emulator\\nwith Visual Studio.\\nAzure Command-Line Interface\\nYou can do everything you need to do in Azure from Visual Studio and the Azure\\nportal. But sometimes you want to run scripts to perform command-level operations,\\nlike when you are working with containers. You can do that using \", \"the Azure Command-\\nLine Interface, or CLI. You can install the Azure CLI on your local development\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 33computer, use a pre-built Docker container, or use it from within the Azure portal,\\nwhere it is a part of Azure Cloud Shell.\\nUsing the CLI in the Azure portal through Cloud Shell is very easy. You don\\u2019t have to\\ninstall anything and you don\\u2019t have to log in to your Azure Subscription because you\\u2019ve\\nalread\", \"y done that to get into the portal.\\nFigure 7: Azure Cloud Shell in the Azure portal\\nAzure Cloud Shell supports Bash and PowerShell as scripting languages. These might not\\nbe things that you use daily as a .NET developer, but they are worth diving into because\\nthey are powerful tools.\\nOnce you are in the CLI, you can do anything from listing all the Azure resources you\\nhave to provisioning new resources.\\nYou can also access Cloud Shell directly in\", \" the browser at https://shell.azure.com or via\\nmobile devices such as iOS and Android.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 34Azure Functions Core Tools\\nAzure Functions run inside Azure App Service Function Apps and are powerful. You can\\nuse them to run small pieces of code that get triggered by outside sources and bind to\\nthings like Azure Blob storage or Azure Cosmos DB.\\nThe Azure Functions Core Tools enable you to develop Azure Function\", \"s locally. You can\\nrun the local version of Azure Functions runtime on your development computer.\\nWith the Azure Functions Core Tools, you can develop and test your Azure Functions\\nlocally. And when you\\u2019re done, you can publish them to Azure or use continuous\\nintegration and continuous delivery to check your Azure Functions code and publish it\\nautomatically to Azure.\\nGet started by creating your first function using Visual Studio an d\\ntest it loc\", \"ally.\\nCosmos DB Emulator\\nWhen you are using Azure Cosmos DB, you can use the Azure Cosmos DB Emulator to\\ndevelop locally. The emulator acts just like Cosmos DB would and even provides the\\nsame interface as Cosmos DB does in the Azure portal.\\nFigure 8: Cosmos DB Emulator local interface\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 35The Cosmos DB Emulator also shows up in the Cloud Explorer in Visual Studio, so that\\nyou can easily manage it from th\", \"ere.\\nBy developing locally against the Cosmos DB emulator, you can develop without\\nincurring costs from a Cosmos DB in Azure. And when you are ready, you can deploy\\nyour application to Azure and run it against Cosmos DB there, just by changing your\\nconnection string.\\nGet started by using the Azure Cosmos DB Emulator\\nfor local development and testing.\\nAzure DevOps for build and deployment\\nOnce you are working on your application, it is vital to in\", \"tegrate your work with the work\\nof other developers (continuous integration).\\nIt is vital to deploy that work to a central location, like an Azure Web App, so that you\\ncan see that it works, and so that it can be tested and promoted through the different\\nenvironments and can be deployed to production (continuous delivery).\\nTo make this work, you need to automatically integrate everybody\\u2019s work and deploy it.\\nIdeally, you would do these things con\", \"tinuously, whenever somebody commits new\\nwork.\\nAzure DevOps, can help with that. It is an application lifecycle management system that\\nmanages your work items and sprints, stores and manages your source code, builds\\nyour code, and deploys it to wherever you want. The best part is, it is very easy to set up.\\nYou can put your source code in DevOps and manage it using the TFS or Git protocols.\\nOnce you start committing changes, you can have those bu\", \"ilt by a simple build\\npipeline that executes something like a Visual Studio build, just like you would on your\\nlocal development computer. You can create such a pipeline by just adding tasks in\\nthe DevOps portal, like in Figure 9.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 36Figure 9: DevOps Build Pipeline\\nYou can set your build up to compile your code and run your unit tests every time\\nsomebody commits. This is continuous integration.\\nAnd once \", \"the build is done, it can kick off a release pipeline that deploys your code to\\nenvironments including development, test, staging, and production. You can deploy\\nyour code to anywhere: to on-premises resources or to the cloud. You can even have\\npermissions gates that require somebody like a product owner to approve the\\ndeployment to production, putting them in control.\\nYou create a release pipeline in the same way as you create a build pipeline\\u2014b\", \"y adding\\ntasks in the Azure DevOps portal, like in Figure 10.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 37Figure 10: Azure DevOps Release Pipeline\\nAzure DevOps is a powerful tool that every .NET developer should have in their arsenal.\\nNow you no longer have an excuse to not do continuous integration and continuous\\ndeployment.\\nGet started with Azure DevOps .\\nDownload and read the free e-book about DevOps for a\\nmicroservices architecture.\\nAzure Q\", \"uick Start Guide for .NET Developers 38Summary and how to get started for free\\nIn this guide, we\\u2019ve introduced the power that Azure can bring to your applications.\\nUsing Azure, you can do incredible things with your applications\\u2014facial and speech\\nrecognition, manage your devices on the Internet of Things in the cloud, scale as much\\nas you want, and pay for what you use.\\nYou\\u2019ve seen that Azure is a great place for .NET developers and architects an\", \"d it\\nprovides tools that have the same world-class quality and depth that you are used to\\nworking with today.
