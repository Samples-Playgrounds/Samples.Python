Written by develop\", \"ers for developers in the .NET ecosystem, this\\nguide will show you how to get started with Azure and\", \" which services you can use to run\\nyour .NET applications and store your data in a more efficient an\", \"d secure way.\\nBefore we dive in, let\\u2019s take a moment to see what the cloud, and Microsoft Azure in\\np\", \"articular, can do for you.\\nWhat can Azure do for you?\\nAzure provides services that can help you acco\", \"mplish many things. These range from\\nthe mundane\\u2014such as adding search functionality to your applica\", \"tion or spinning up\\na new SQL database to connect to your recent .NET app\\u2014to more exotic projects\\nsu\", \"ch as implementing continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)\\nworkflows. You also ca\", \"n automatically tune your database or set up push notifications\\nto mobile devices, easily and quickl\", \"y. These are just a few examples of some common\\nprojects that developers have repeatedly had to crea\", \"te for themselves but that are\\nnow available as a service. And you can use these services with littl\", \"e effort\\u2014almost\\nlike flipping a light switch! You can then focus on the pieces of your application t\", \"hat\\nmake it unique\\u2014the features that provide real added value for your users.\\nBesides services, Azur\", \"e offers compute resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs),\\ncontainers, databases, web app ser\", \"vices, and mobile services. You can use these to host\\napplications or to provide a complete infrastr\", \"ucture for your users, most of which you\\ncan do through Visual Studio.\\nThe power of the cloud is tha\", \"t services and resources are incredibly robust and resilient.\\nIt is very unlikely that they will fai\", \"l to run, because the cloud is smart and self-healing.\\nWith Azure, there are datacenters all over th\", \"e world, filled with tens of thousands of\\nservers. If one server fails, another takes over. If an en\", \"tire datacenter were to fail (a highly\\nunlikely scenario), another would take over. All this is poss\", \"ible because of the massive\\nscale of the cloud.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 5One of \", \"the most compelling arguments in favor of the cloud is that you can scale up\\nyour services and resou\", \"rces almost infinitely, with just a few clicks of a button. You can\\u2019t\\ndo that with on-premises resou\", \"rces unless you\\u2019re prepared to spend enormous sums of\\nmoney on capital equipment which would remain \", \"largely idle and staff to administer it\\nall. You can scale globally without having to build data cen\", \"ters around the world by\\nputting your services anywhere in the world eliminating latency and providi\", \"ng a high-\\nperformance experience to your users, regardless of where they are. It also means that\\nyo\", \"u can keep your data where you need it to be, observing data residency\\nrequirements.\\nEqually importa\", \"nt, when you use cloud resources, you can scale back your services and\\nresources when there is no lo\", \"nger high demand. This allows you to scale up and down\\neven during the course of a normal day keepin\", \"g applications economical and\\nperformant.\\nIn addition to massive scalability, off-the-shelf intellig\", \"ent services, and pay-per-use\\nefficiency, the cloud offers increased security. The cloud is used by \", \"millions of people,\\n24x7, worldwide. Of course, it is also attacked by many people. Reputable and\\nex\", \"perienced cloud providers like Microsoft recognize the usage patterns of normal users\\nand those of m\", \"alicious actors. This means we know how to protect against both the\\nmost common and most unique atta\", \"cks out there. Intelligent monitoring tools, machine\\nlearning algorithms, and artificial intelligenc\", \"e give cloud providers the ability to detect\\nattacks in real time and stop them in their tracks.\\nDec\", \"ades of experience in security and massive-scale traffic, combined with top industry\\nsecurity expert\", \"ise, make the cloud a much more secure environment than any on-\\npremises datacenter.\\nMore info\\nTo re\", \"ad more about how Azure secures your applications and data, read the official Azure\\nSecurity blog, A\", \" zure Security Overview, and how to get started with Azure Security\\n.\\nWe\\u2019ve briefly explored reasons\", \" to begin your migration to the cloud and Microsoft Azure.\\nNow, let\\u2019s examine which Azure services a\", \"re useful for you for running and securing your\\napplications and storing your data.\\nAzure Quick Star\", \"t Guide for .NET Developers 6Getting Started with Azure services\\nLet\\u2019s explore some of the services \", \"that you can use for running your applications in\\nAzure, storing your data in Azure, and securing yo\", \"ur application with Azure.\\nRunning your .NET applications in Azure\\nOne of the first decisions that y\", \"ou need to make when you start with Azure is which\\nservice(s) to use to run your applications in Azu\", \"re. There are many options. Let\\u2019s start by\\nlaying out which Azure services are most suitable for whi\", \"ch application types in Table 1.\\nTable 1: Which Azure services are best suited for which types of ap\", \"plications?\\nApp Service Azure\\nApp Service Azure Virtual Container\\nMobile Logic Apps Kubernetes\\nWeb A\", \"pps Functions Machines Instances\\nApps Service (AKS)\\nMonolithic *\\nand N-Tier\\napplications\\n*\\nMobile ap\", \"p\\nback end\\nMicroservice\\narchitecture-\\nbased\\napplications\\nBusiness process\\norchestrations\\nand workflo\", \"ws\\n* For lifting and shifting existing applications to Azure.\\nAzure App Services\\nOne of the easiest \", \"and most powerful ways to host your applications in Azure is in Azure\\nApp Service. Azure App Service\", \" is a group of services that takes care of hosting your\\napplication and abstracting away the complex\", \"ities of the operating system and\\ninfrastructure. They are highly available by default and will stay\", \" up and running for at\\nleast 99.95% of the time.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 7They s\", \"hare powerful features like automatic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and\\neasy authentication an\", \"d authorization. They also allow you to debug your application\\nwhile it is running in production (wi\", \"th the Snapshot Debugger) and work very well with\\nApplication Insights, which you can use to monitor\", \" every aspect of your app, from\\nperformance to usage.\\nThere are several different types of App Servi\", \"ce apps.\\nAzure Web Apps\\nRunning a .NET web application in Azure is very easy in Azure Web Apps. Web \", \"Apps act\\nas a web server as a service, like IIS. And you can simply deploy your ASP.NET or\\nASP.NET C\", \"ore application with Visual Studio to Web Apps and run it. These can be\\nwebsites, APIs, or any other\", \" HTTP-driven application including Node.js, Python and Java\\napplications.\\nOnce your application runs\", \" in an App Service web app, you can scale it up or down, add\\neasy authentication, use deployment slo\", \"ts, enable continuous deployment, and use any\\nof the other App Service features. By default, your ap\", \"plication is available on the\\ninternet, without you needing to set up a domain name or configure DNS\", \" settings,\\nalthough you can do that.\\nTry it now - G et started by creating an ASP.NET Core web app i\", \"n Azure\\nContainers on App Services\\nDevelopers who want the power of App Services but need to maintai\", \"n a higher level of\\ncontrol over their environments can also run containers. Both Linux and Windows\\n\", \"containers are supported. You can deploy your own containers from the Azure\\nContainer Registry, a pr\", \"ivate Docker registry or public containers from the Docker Hub.\\nThis allows you to run a wide range \", \"of pre-configured applications from WordPress to\\nRedis which can be deployed either as single contai\", \"ners or as part of a multi-container\\napplication. Windows container support also helps you migrate e\", \"xisting ASP.NET apps\\nand WCF services that need access to the Windows OS, install custom components,\", \" or\\nuse the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 8Azure Mobile A\", \"pps\\nIf you are building mobile applications, you will need a back end that the mobile app\\nconnects t\", \"o. Usually, this is some sort of API that your app can use to retrieve and store\\ndata. Azure Mobile \", \"Apps provides you with such a back end. You can write it in C# or\\nuse any of the Quickstart applicat\", \"ions.\\nA mobile back end that runs in Azure Mobile Apps provides unique capabilities. For\\ninstance, y\", \"ou can use offline sync, which enables the mobile app to continue working\\nwhen there is no connectio\", \"n to the back end and sync changes once the connection is\\nrestored. And with push notifications you \", \"can send notifications to the mobile apps\\nusing C# code, regardless of the platform it runs on (iOS,\", \" Android, Windows). In addition\\nto these unique features, Mobile Apps shares all the other features \", \"of Azure App Service.\\nGet started by creating an Android app with an Azure mobile app back end.\\nAzur\", \"e Functions (also known as serverless compute)\\nAzure Function apps enable you to create Azure Functi\", \"ons in C# and many other\\nlanguages in Visual Studio and other IDEs and editors. Each Functions app c\", \"ontains one\\nor more Azure Functions and provides integration with authentication and deployment\\nslot\", \"s.\\nThe Azure Functions that run in Azure Function apps are small pieces of code that you\\nwrite, with\", \"out you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or about scaling.\\nMany refer to this dep\", \"loyment model as Functions as a Service (FaaS).\\nFunction applications can be simply triggered by a w\", \"ide variety of events originating\\nboth inside and outside of Azure. HTTP triggers allow web requests\", \" to be served by a\\nfunction app. Event Grid events can trigger Azure Functions when changes are made\", \" to\\nAzure resources such as the container registry and virtual machines.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for\", \" .NET Developers 9Here is an example: You write an Azure Functions app that executes every time a ne\", \"w\\nimage file is uploaded to Azure Storage. You then take that image, rename it, and\\noutput it to ano\", \"ther Azure Storage account.\\nThis is very easy to do. You just write the code to rename the image. Az\", \"ure Functions\\ntakes care of getting the input image when the function is triggered. And it takes car\", \"e of\\nwriting the image to the other storage account. It takes care of all the plumbing, and\\nyou just\", \" write the code.\\nAzure Functions even handles scaling for you. So it doesn\\u2019t matter if there are 1,0\", \"00\\nimages that trigger the function at the same time. Azure Functions transparently spins up\\nmore fu\", \"nctions to deal with it and they go away when the code is done executing.\\nBecause of this, you only \", \"pay for the code that you execute, not for a service that runs all\\nthe time, waiting to be triggered\", \".\\nAzure Functions are great for executing small pieces of code that perform one or two\\nsteps on an i\", \"nput and an output. If you want to perform more steps of a larger process,\\nyou can use Durable Funct\", \"ions.\\nDurable Functions provide a stateful experience on top of a series of Azure Functions.\\nThey en\", \"able complex patterns such as scatter/gather and function chaining. A Durable\\nFunction orchestration\", \" may be as simple as coupling together two functions, one after\\nanother, or as complex as coordinati\", \"ng tens of thousands of function calls over weeks.\\nGet started by creating your first Azure Function\", \" with Visual Studio\\n.\\nAzure Logic Apps\\nDurable Functions are a fantastic orchestration tool for deve\", \"lopers who are comfortable\\nwith writing every step of the process inside a series of Functions. For \", \"those looking for\\na lower code solution Logic Applications may be better. With Azure Logic Apps, you\", \" can\\norchestrate a process just by weaving API calls together in a visual designer in Visual\\nStudio \", \"or the Azure portal. Visual Studio offers a specific Logic Apps project template to\\nget started.\\nAzu\", \"re Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 10A logic app has a trigger, just like an Azure function do\", \"es. This can be an outside trigger,\\nlike when a new blob is added, or a certain text is tweeted. Or \", \"it can be a manual trigger\\nor a trigger on a schedule such as every 15 minutes.\\nOnce triggered, a lo\", \"gic app takes its input and calls APIs with it to complete a process.\\nYou just click this together b\", \"y choosing APIs from a large list of available ones and\\nchoosing the input and output for those APIs\", \". Azure Functions can also be used for APIs\\nin a logic app. And you can use your own ASP.NET Core AP\", \"Is.\\nHere\\u2019s an e xample :\\nA logic app gets triggered by a new blob that is written in Azure Blob stor\", \"age . It takes the\\nBlob input, which is an image file, and resizes the image by calling an Azure fun\", \"ction that\\ndoes just that. Next, it takes the resized image and writes it to another storage account\", \".\\nAnd finally, it calls the O ffice 365 AP I to send an email to the administrator that there is a\\nn\", \"ew, resized image available .\\nJust like Azure functions, logic apps scale automatically, you just cr\", \"eate the process. It will trigger as\\nmany times as it is needed and always executes the complete pro\", \"cess and has reliability features, like\\nretry policies, built in. And because it only runs when it i\", \"s triggered, you only pay for when it runs\\u2014you\\ndon\\u2019t pay for owning it.\\nGet started by building your\", \" first logic app workflow in the Azure porta l .\\nNote: Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions work ver\", \"y well with the Azure Event Grid service. Event Grid allows you to\\nsubscribe to events, like when so\", \"mething happens in your application, and to push that information as an event that can\\ntrigger a Log\", \"ic App or an Azure Function.\\nAzure Virtual Machines\\nA very different way of running your application\", \" is by taking advantage of Azure Virtual\\nMachines. This is an easy way to get started, because you c\", \"an lift-and-shift existing\\napplications from virtual machines that you run in your datacenter to VMs\", \" that run in\\nAzure. There are many predefined VM images that you can use, like Windows Server\\n2019 t\", \"hat runs IIS and has ASP.NET installed and preconfigured on it. You can even\\nbring your own software\", \" licenses if you already have one (like for SQL Server).\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers\", \" 11Running your application in a VM doesn\\u2019t provide you the features like zero-downtime\\ndeployments \", \"and easy authentication. You are also responsible for patching the\\noperating system and for making s\", \"ure that antivirus software is up to date.\\nOn the other hand, it does provide you with the ability t\", \"o easily scale your VM to a\\nbigger size or automatically scale it down when it isn\\u2019t used that much.\", \" Virtual Machine\\nScale Sets allow for scaling out VMs to a large number of nodes and load balancing\\n\", \"work between them. And it offers you the reliability of running something in Azure. It is\\nvery unlik\", \"ely that your VM will stop running, and Microsoft guarantees this uptime with\\na comprehensive SLA.\\nA\", \"nd if you\\u2019re not ready to run your production VMs in Azure you can still take\\nadvantage of streamlin\", \"ed DevOps and testing with Azure DevTest Labs.\\nGet started by Creating a Windows virtual machine wit\", \"h the Azure porta. l\\nA word about microservices and containers\\nYou can run your applications in cont\", \"ainers, which are very lightweight and start and\\nstop in seconds. Containers isolate your applicatio\", \"n and its dependencies in a way that\\nguarantees that you\\u2019ll never run into library version conflicts\", \". They can be based on\\nnumerous popular Linux distributions or Windows Server so no matter the platf\", \"orm your\\napplication uses it can run in a container.\\nA popular approach for containers is to use the\", \"m to run a microservices architecture.\\nThis means that you create many small, isolated, services tha\", \"t each have their own\\nfunction and each have separate development and deployment lifecycles. Contain\", \"ers\\ncan also be used to lift and shift existing applications to run at scale in the cloud.\\nAzure pro\", \"vides several services to support running a microservices architecture in\\ncontainers. Running the in\", \"creasingly popular orchestration engine Kubernetes, Azure\\nKubernetes Service (AKS) provides a powerf\", \"ul tool to run anything from a handful of\\ncontainers to hundreds of thousands of them. AKS can all r\", \"un and orchestrate\\ncontainers. Orchestration of containers is quite different from orchestrating a p\", \"rocess,\\nlike Logic Apps does. Orchestrating containers means that you manage their lifecycles.\\nProvi\", \"sion new ones, scale up or down, manage failures, and so on.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Develo\", \"pers 12You can learn more about microservices by reading:\\n.NET Microservices Architecture Guidance\\nW\", \"hich frameworks and technologies can you use in which Azure service?\\nNow that you know what the opti\", \"ons are for running your application in Azure, it is\\nextremely useful to know which version of .NET \", \"you can run in these services and what\\nkind of containers they support.

In Azure, you can\\nrun your SQL Server \", \"workload in Azure SQL Database. This is SQL Server in the cloud. It\\nis the same thing that you run o\", \"n-premises but it offers a lot of advantages.\\nYou can do (almost) everything with it that you can do\", \" with on-premises SQL Server.\\nAnd, in fact, new SQL Server features are incorporated in Azure SQL Da\", \"tabase first and\\nlater in the on-premises SQL Server.\\nYou can use Azure SQL Databases with your favo\", \"rite tools, like Azure Data Studio, Server\\nExplorer and SQL Server Data Tools in Visual Studio and S\", \"QL Server Management\\nStudio.\\nBecause they run in the cloud, Azure SQL Databases are fully managed, s\", \"calable, and\\nhigh performing. They are automatically backed up and have many advanced features,\\nsuch\", \" as:\\n\\u2022 Single-click Geo-replication, which replicates data to other geographical regions in\\nreal tim\", \"e, incredibly easily.

(Get started with Azure SQL Database automatic tuning.)\\nAzure Quick Start\", \" Guide for .NET Developers 15In addition to all these features, Azure SQL Databases are exceptionall\", \"y reliable by\\ndefault. Without configuring anything, transaction log backups are made every 5-10\\nmin\", \"utes and differential backups every 12 hours. These backups are stored three times\\nin the local data\", \"center and three times in another datacenter. And you can restore\\nbackups from 35 days ago, dependin\", \"g on the pricing tier that you use.\\nIt is very easy to use Azure SQL Databases from a .NET applicati\", \"on. You can, for instance,\\nuse the Entity Framework (or Entity Framework Core) to access the databas\", \"e and write\\nand read data to and from it. For the most part accessing data programmatically is no\\ndi\", \"fferent from accessing data in an on-premises SQL Server.\\nGet started by creating an Azure SQL Datab\", \"ase in the Azure Porta. l\\nAzure Cosmos DB\\nAzure Cosmos DB is a new kind of database that is globally\", \" distributed and cloud native.\\nHere are some of its key features:\\n\\u2022 A 99.99% SLA (99.999% for read o\", \"perations) that includes low latencies (less than 10\\nms on reads; less than 15 ms on writes).\\n\\u2022 Geo-\", \"replication, which replicates data to other geographical regions in real time\\n(How to distribute dat\", \"a globally with Azure Cosmos DB).\\n\\u2022 Tunable data consistency levels, so you can choose data consiste\", \"ncy, enabling a\\ntruly globally distributed data system. You can, for instance, choose strong\\nconsist\", \"ency, eventual consistency, or session consistency.\\n\\u2022 Traffic management, which sends users to the d\", \"ata replica to which they are closest.\\n\\u2022 Limitless global scale. You pay only for the throughput and\", \" storage that you need.\\n\\u2022 Automatic indexing of data. No need to maintain or tune the database anymo\", \"re.\\nIn addition to all these features, Cosmos DB offers different APIs with which you can\\nstore and \", \"retrieve data, including SQL, Gremlin, MongoDB, Azure Table Storage, and\\nApache Cassandra. Different\", \" APIs handle data in different ways. You can use documents\\nas data as well as unstructured tables, g\", \"raphs, and blobs. You use the API that fits your\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 16needs\", \", and Cosmos DB takes care of the rest. If your application already uses one of\\nthese protocols swit\", \"ching to Cosmos DB is as simple as changing a connection string.\\nYou benefit from cloud-grade perfor\", \"mance, scalability, and reliability, and still use the\\nprogramming model to which you\\u2019re accustomed.\", \"\\nYou can use Cosmos DB from .NET Framework and .NET Core. For example, you can use\\nits SQL API throu\", \"gh the NuGet package Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB or\\nMicrosoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core (for .NET Core).\\n\", \"Get started with Azure Cosmos DB with the SQL API and .NET Cor.e\\nAzure Storage\\nWith Azure Storage, o\", \"ne of the most fundamental services in Azure, you can store data\\nin different forms. It is easy to u\", \"se, fast, and inexpensive. Azure Storage offers several\\ntypes of storage that you can use for differ\", \"ent scenarios. All these storage types share\\ncommon features like encryption for data at rest, secur\", \"ity through shared access\\nsignatures, and firewalls and virtual networks.\\nAzure Storage is also very\", \" reliable. By default, data is replicated three times within the\\ndatacenter. You can also choose geo\", \"-replicated storage, which, in addition to the three\\nlocal replicas, replicates the data three times\", \" to another datacenter. You can create your\\napplication in such a manner that it reads from this geo\", \"-replicated data, which is close\\nto your users, so that it is geographically high performing.\\nYou ca\", \"n use Azure Storage from your .NET Framework and .NET Core applications by\\nusing the WindowsAzure.St\", \"orage NuGet package and referencing the specific API that\\nyou need, like Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Stor\", \"age.Blob (for Blob storage) in a using\\nstatement in your code.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Deve\", \"lopers 17Let\\u2019s explore the different types of Azure Storage:\\nFile Storage\\nAzure File storage uses th\", \"e SMB protocol, which makes it very suitable for lifting and\\nshifting your file server into the clou\", \"d. When you have files in Azure Files, you can mount\\nan Azure file share to a VM or even to your own\", \" Windows machine, to use as external\\nstorage.\\nGet started with Azure Files.\\nAzure Disk Storage is a \", \"similar service to Azure File but is dedicated to a single machine.\\nIt is available in four differen\", \"t performance levels from Standard HDD to Ultra SSD. The\\nhigh performance tiers are suitable for hea\", \"vy I/O workloads such as running SAP HANA\\nor complex analytical models.\\nTable Storage\\nAzure Table st\", \"orage is an inexpensive and extremely fast NoSQL key-value store that\\nyou can use to store data in f\", \"lexible tables. A table can contain one row describing an\\norder and another row describing customer \", \"information. You don\\u2019t need to define a\\ndata schema. This makes Table Storage very flexible.\\nGet sta\", \"rted with Azure Table storage.\\nBlob Storage\\nYou can use Azure Blob storage to store large unstructur\", \"ed data\\u2014literally, blobs of data.\\nThis can be video, image, audio, text, or even virtual hard drive \", \"(VHD) files for VMs.\\nAdditionally, you can use Blob tiers to reduce your storage costs. By default, \", \"blobs are\\nwritten to the hot tier, which means that they are written and read very fast. You can\\nals\", \"o put blobs in the cool tier if you have data that is infrequently accessed and stored\\nfor at least \", \"30 days. The cool tier is less expensive than the hot tier. And finally, you can\\nstore blobs in the \", \"archive tier, that is the least expensive. The archive tier is for data\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for \", \".NET Developers 18that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days. Reading data from the ar\", \"chive\\ntier can take hours. Blob tiering is a great way to save costs if you are storing large\\namount\", \"s of data.\\nGet started with Azure Blob storage.\\nQueue Storage\\nAzure Queue storage is an unusual type\", \" of storage in that it is used to store small\\nmessages of data, but its main purpose is to serve as \", \"a queue. You put messages on the\\nqueue and other processes pick it up. This pattern decouples the me\", \"ssage sender from\\nthe message processor and results in performance and reliability benefits. Azure Q\", \"ueue\\nstorage is similar to Microsoft Message Queuing that you can find in Windows.\\nGet started with \", \"Azure Queue storage.\\n|Note: Azure Service Bus Topics and Queues also provide queuing mechanisms, wit\", \"h slightly different properties than Azure Storage\\nqueues.\\nAzure Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, an\", \"d MariaDB\\nAs a .NET developer, you encounter many different open-source database types in your\\njob. \", \"Some of them can now be used in a managed version in Azure.\\nAzure provides MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Ma\", \"riaDB databases as managed databases,\\nwhich means that you just spin them up and don\\u2019t have to worry\", \" about any of the\\nunderlying infrastructure. Just like Azure SQL Databases and Cosmos DB, these\\ndata\", \"bases are universally available, scalable, highly secure, and fully managed.\\nEach of these is suited\", \" for slightly different use cases, but in general, their functionality\\noverlaps a lot. You would use\", \" Azure Databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB\\nwhen you are already using one of their on-premi\", \"ses versions and want the advantage\\nof having that run fully managed in the cloud.

You need to store user\\nidentities and credentials, implement password management, create a secure\", \"\\nauthentication handshake, and so on.\\nAzure Active Directory provides all these things and more out \", \"of the box. You store your\\nuser identities in Azure Active Directory and have users authenticate aga\", \"inst it,\\nredirecting them to your application only after they are authenticated. Azure Active\\nDirect\", \"ory takes care of password management, including common scenarios like \\u201cI\\nforgot my password.\\u201d Azure\", \" Active Directory is used by millions of applications every\\nday, including the Azure portal, Outlook\", \".com, and Office 365. Because of this, it is able\\nto more readily detect malicious behavior and act \", \"on it. For instance, if a user were to\\nsign in to an application from a location in Europe and then \", \"one minute later sign in\\nfrom Australia, Azure Active Directory would flag this as malicious behavio\", \"r and ask the\\nuser for additional credentials through multifactor authentication.\\nTo programmaticall\", \"y talk to Azure Active Directory, you can use the Active Directory\\nAuthenticating Library (ADAL) for\", \" .NET Framework and .NET Core.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 21Get started by integrat\", \"ing Azure AD into an ASP.NET Core web ap.p\\nAzure Key Vault\\nIt is important to keep secrets such as p\", \"asswords and connection strings out of source\\ncode. So where do you put them? In Azure Key Vault.\\nAz\", \"ure Key Vault is a safe place to store passwords, connection strings, access codes,\\nand certificate \", \"keys. It is fully managed by Azure, so you don\\u2019t have to worry about\\nthe underlying infrastructure. \", \"You just spin it up and use it.\\nYou can use it as a configuration store in your applications, just l\", \"ike you would use a\\nweb.config file.

You can now use Azure Managed Service\\nIde\", \"ntity.\\nAzure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 22You can use Managed Service Identity from a lot\", \" of services in Azure, including from\\nAzure App Service. From there, you can enable it to inject cre\", \"dentials into your\\napplication at runtime and use those credentials to access other services, like A\", \"zure Key\\nVault.\\nYou can use the Managed Service Identity from the .NET Framework and .NET Core\\nusing\", \" the Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication NuGet package.\\nGet started by using Key Vault from A\", \"pp Service wit h\\nManaged Service Identity.\\nAzure Advisor\\nThere are a lot of moving parts in Azure so\", \" Microsoft provides a tool called Azure\\nAdvisor which examines your Azure resources and makes recomm\", \"endations. The\\nrecommendations include how to save money by making more efficient use of Azure\\nresou\", \"rces and suggestions on how to make your Azure resources more secure. The\\nsecurity advisor will catc\", \"h and rank problems like world readable Blob Storage and give\\ninstructions on how to better secure y\", \"our environment.\\nOther Azure services\\nEnhance your application performance\\nAzure can also help you t\", \"o boost your applications\\u2019 performance. One service that helps\\nwith this is Azure Redis Cache, which\", \" provides high-performance, in-memory, key-value\\nstorage. Another is Azure Content Delivery Network,\", \" or CDN, which can replicate your\\nstatic content, like images and video files to points-of-presence \", \"all over the world,\\nmaking sure that it is as close to your users as possible. And finally, Azure Tr\", \"affic\\nManager can improve application responsiveness by routing users to locations with the\\nlowest l\", \"atency.\\nMachine Learning\\nAzure provides an industry leading suite of services that can make your app\", \"lication more\\nintelligent. Azure Cognitive Services are a suite of APIs that can do things which wou\", \"ld\\nbe nearly impossible using traditional programming approaches. You can quickly build\\nAzure Quick \", \"Start Guide for .NET Developers 23applications which can recognize faces, convert speech to text and\", \" understand the\\nmeaning of text. Using the Language Understanding service you can create bots which\\n\", \"can intelligently respond to requests in Slack, Microsoft Teams and other forums.\\nYou can also creat\", \"e your own machine learning algorithms with Azure Machine Learning.\\nTraining jobs created in popular\", \" tools such as Tensorflow can be submitted to run on a\\ncluster of GPU-enabled Virtual Machines, vast\", \"ly decreasing the time to train models.\\nInternet of Things (IoT)\\nWhen you are building a solution ba\", \"sed on the Internet of Things, Azure can help you\\nwith services like Azure IoT Hub, which can ingest\", \" massive amounts of messages from\\nIoT devices and manage the devices. Azure IoT Suite makes it possi\", \"ble for you to\\nmanage your IoT devices without doing everything yourself. And if you have limited Io\", \"T\\nexperience, you can use Azure IoT Central, which is a SaaS solution that enables you to\\nuse IoT wi\", \"th minimal customization. And finally, there is Azure IoT Edge, which allows\\nIoT devices to do some \", \"of the calculations locally, instead of having to communicate\\nwith the cloud for every operation. Tr\", \"ained ML models can even be deployed to edge\\ndevices enabling capabilities such as image recognition\", \" in disconnected hardware.\\nData Analytics\\nThere are many services in Azure for doing data analytics,\", \" including Azure Data Factory\\nfor moving and transforming data; Azure Analysis Services, which provi\", \"des an in-\\nmemory data analytics platform; and Azure Data Lake Analytics, which can perform U-\\nSQL j\", \"obs on Azure Data Lake Store. You can also take advantage of Azure Stream\\nAnalytics to analyze data \", \"on the fly and Azure Time Series Insights, which provides a\\nunique data analytics platform for time-\", \"based data that can store and analyze data and\\ncan show information using its own data visualization\", \" engine. In addition, there is Azure\\nDatabricks, which offers a managed cluster of enhanced Apache S\", \"park\\u2013based analytics\\nengines, and Azure HDInsight, which you can use to spin up managed clusters of \", \"open-\\nsource data analytics platforms and tools, like Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, and\\nApache HBase.\\n\", \"Azure Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers 24Messaging\\nAzure also provides services that can help y\", \"ou build scalable architectures with events\\nand messages. Azure Queue Storage and Azure Service Bus \", \"Topics and Queues can help\\nwith that by providing queuing mechanisms that decouple your services. Az\", \"ure Event\\nGrid can help by subscribing to events, like blobs being added and pushing an event to\\nwho\", \"ever is subscribed to it. And Azure Event Hubs can ingest massive amounts of data,\\nwhich you can pro\", \"cess, filter, and store in your own time. Using messaging to\\ncommunicate between services in Azure a\", \"llows you to handle load smoothly while also\\npreventing data loss in the event a service is unavaila\", \"ble.\\nMedia Services\\nWorking with (streaming) media can be challenging. Azure Media Services can help\", \" you\\nby providing services like encoding, which encodes your media files into the file formats\\nand s\", \"creen sizes they need to be. Azure Content Protection enables you to use DRM\\ntechnologies like PlayR\", \"eady to make sure that your content is only used by authorized\\nusers. With live streaming you can st\", \"ream media worldwide at massive scale. And by\\nusing Media Analytics you can enhance media by doing i\", \"ntelligent things like creating\\nsubtitles for a movie based on speech.\\nMonitoring\\nAnd finally, you n\", \"eed to monitor your applications that run in Azure, to make sure that\\nthey run smoothly. The monitor\", \"ing tools in Azure fall under the umbrella of Azure\\nMonitor. There are services like Azure Applicati\", \"on Insights that can help you to monitor\\nevery aspect of your application.
