Rearchitecting an application by using an\\nadvanced approach like microservices isn\\u2019t always an option because of cost and time restraints.\\nDepending on the type of application, rearchitecting an app also might not be necessary. To optimize\\nthe cost-effectiveness of your organization\\u2019s cloud migration\", \" strategy, it\\u2019s important to consider the\\nneeds of your business and the requirements of your apps. You\\u2019ll need to determine:\\n\\n\\n  - Which apps require a transformation or rearchitecting.\\n\\n\\n  - Which apps need to be only partially modernized.\\n\\n\\n  - Which apps you can \\u201clift and shift\\u201d directly to the cloud.\\n\\n\\n### About this guide\\n\\nThis guide focuses primarily on the initial modernization of existing Microsoft .NET Framework web or\\nservice-oriented \", \"applications, meaning the action of moving a workload to a newer or more modern\\nenvironment without significantly altering the application\\u2019s code and basic architecture.\\n\\n\\nThis guide also highlights the benefits of moving your apps to the cloud and partially modernizing\\napps by using a specific set of new technologies and approaches, like Windows Containers and\\nrelated compute-platforms in Azure supporting Windows Containers.\\n### Path to the clou\", \"d for existing .NET applications\\n\\n\\nOrganizations typically choose to move to the cloud for the agility and speed they can get for their\\napplications. You can set up thousands of servers (VMs) in the cloud in minutes, compared to the\\nweeks it typically takes to set up on-premises servers.\\n\\n\\nThere isn\\u2019t a single, one-size-fits-all strategy for migrating applications to the cloud. The right\\nmigration strategy for you will depend on your organization\", \"\\u2019s needs and priorities, and the kind of\\napplications you are migrating. Not all applications warrant the investment of moving to a platform as\\n[a service (PaaS) model or developing a cloud-native](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas/) application model. In many cases, you can take a\\nphased or incremental approach to invest in moving your assets to the cloud, based on your business\\nneeds.\\n\\n\\nFor modern applications with the best long\", \"-term agility and value for the organization, you might\\nbenefit from investing in _cloud-native_ application architectures. However, for applications that are\\nexisting or legacy assets, the key is to spend minimal time and money (no rearchitecting or code\\nchanges) while moving them to the cloud, to realize significant benefits.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1-1 shows the possible paths you can take when you move existing .NET applications to the\\ncloud in incremental \", \"phases.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 1-1. Modernization paths for existing .NET applications and services_\\n\\n\\nEach migration approach has different benefits and reasons for using it. You can choose a single\\napproach when you migrate apps to the cloud, or choose certain components from multiple\\napproaches. Individual applications aren\\u2019t limited to a single approach or maturity state. For instance,\\na common hybrid approach would have certain on-premises components plu\", \"s other components in\\nthe cloud.\\n\\n\\nThe definition and short explanation for each application maturity level are the following:\\n\\n\\n**Level 1: Cloud Infrastructure-Ready** applications: In this migration approach, you just migrate or\\n[rehost your current on-premises applications to an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform. Your](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-iaas/)\\napps have almost the same composition as before, but now you dep\", \"loy them to VMs in the cloud.\\nThis simple type of migration is typically known in the industry as \\u201cLift & Shift.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n**Level 2: Cloud Optimized** applications: At this level and still without rearchitecting or altering\\nsignificant code, you can gain additional benefits from running your app in the cloud with modern\\ntechnologies like containers and additional cloud-managed services. You improve the agility of your\\napplications to ship faster by ref\", \"ining your enterprise development operations (DevOps) processes.\\nYou achieve this functionality by using technologies like Windows Containers, which is based on\\nDocker Engine. Containers remove the friction that\\u2019s caused by application dependencies when you\\ndeploy in multiple stages. In this maturity model, you can deploy containers on IaaS or PaaS while\\nusing additional cloud-managed services related to databases, cache as a service, monitoring,\", \" and\\ncontinuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.\\n\\n\\nThe third level of maturity is the ultimate goal in the cloud, but it\\u2019s optional for many apps and not the\\nmain focus of this guide:\\n\\n\\n**Level 3: Cloud-Native** applications: This migration approach typically is driven by business need and\\ntargets modernizing your mission-critical applications. At this level, you use PaaS services to move\\n[your apps to PaaS computing platforms\", \". You implement cloud-native](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3181919/architect-design-cloudnative-applications) applications and microservices\\narchitecture to evolve applications with long-term agility, and to scale to new limits. This type of\\nmodernization usually requires architecting specifically for the cloud. New code often must be written,\\nespecially when you move to cloud-native application and microservice-based models. This approach\\ncan hel\", \"p you gain benefits that are difficult to achieve in your monolithic and on-premises application\\nenvironment.\\n\\n\\nTable 1-1 describes the main benefits of and reasons for choosing each migration or modernization\\napproach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|Cloud Infrastructure-Ready<br>Lift and shift|Cloud-Optimized<br>Modernize|Cloud-Native<br>Modernize, rearchitect, and<br>rewrite|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|**Application\\u2019s compute target**|||\\n|Applications deployed to VMs<br>in Azur\", \"e|Monolithic or N-Tier apps<br>deployed to Azure App Service,<br>Azure Container Instance (ACI),<br>VMs with containers, or AKS<br>(Azure Kubernetes Service)|Containerized microservices on<br>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)<br>and/or serverless microservices<br>based on Azure Functions.|\\n|**Data target**|||\\n|SQL or any relational database<br>on a VM|Azure SQL Database Managed<br>Instance or another managed<br>database in the cloud.|Fined-grain dat\", \"abases per<br>microservice, based on Azure<br>SQL Database, Azure Cosmos<br>DB, or another managed<br>database in the cloud|\\n|**Advantages**|||\\n||||\\n|**Challenges**|||\\n||||\\n\\n\\n\\n**Table 1-1.** Benefits and challenges of modernization paths for existing .NET applications and services\\n\\n#### **Key technologies and architectures by maturity level**\\n\\n\\n.NET Framework applications initially started with .NET Framework version 1.0, which was released in\\nla\", \"te 2001. Then, companies moved towards newer versions (such as 2.0, 3.5 and .NET Framework 4.x).\\nMost of those applications ran on Windows Server and Internet Information Server (IIS), and used a\\nrelational database, like SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or any other RDBMS.\\n\\n\\nMost existing .NET applications might nowadays be based on .NET Framework 4.x, or even on .NET\\nFramework 3.5, and use web frameworks like ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET W\", \"eb API,\\nWindows Communication Foundation (WCF), ASP.NET SignalR, and ASP.NET Web Pages. These\\nestablished .NET Framework technologies depend on Windows. That dependency is important to\\n\\n\\nconsider if you are simply migrating legacy apps and you want to make minimal changes to your\\napplication infrastructure.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1-2 shows the primary technologies and architecture styles used at each of the three cloud\\nmaturity levels:\\n\\n\\n_Figure 1-2. Primary t\", \"echnologies for each maturity level for modernizing existing .NET web applications_\\n\\n\\nFigure 1-2 highlights the most common scenarios, but many hybrid and mixed variations are possible\\nwhen it comes to architecture. For example, the maturity models apply not only to monolithic\\narchitectures in existing web apps, but also to service orientation, N-Tier, and other architecture style\\nvariations. The higher focus or percentage on one or another archi\", \"tecture type and related\\ntechnologies determines the overall maturity level of your applications.\\n\\n\\nEach maturity level in the modernization process is associated with the following key technologies and\\napproaches:\\n\\n\\n  - **Cloud Infrastructure-Ready** (rehost or basic lift & shift): As a first step, many organizations\\nwant only to quickly execute a cloud-migration strategy. In this case, applications are\\n[rehosted. Most rehosting can be automated\", \" by using Azure Migrate, a service that provides](https://aka.ms/azuremigrate)\\nthe guidance, insights, and mechanisms needed to assist you in migrating to Azure based on\\n[cloud tools like Azure Site Recovery and Azure Database Migration Service. You can also set](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery/)\\nup rehosting manually, so that you can learn infrastructure details about your assets when\\nyou move legacy apps to the cloud. For exa\", \"mple, you can move your applications to VMs in\\nAzure with little modification-probably with only minor configuration changes. The\\nnetworking in this case is similar to an on-premises environment, especially if you create\\nvirtual networks in Azure.\\n\\n\\n  - **Cloud-Optimized** (Managed Services and Windows Containers): This model is about making\\na few important deployment optimizations to gain some significant benefits from the cloud,\\n\\n\\nwithout chang\", \"ing the core architecture of the application. The fundamental step here is to\\n[add Windows Containers support to your existing .NET Framework applications. This](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/)\\nimportant step (containerization) doesn\\u2019t require touching the code, so the overall lift and\\n[shift effort is light. You can use tools like Image2Docker](https://github.com/docker/communitytools-image2docker-win) or Visu\", \"al Studio, with its tools for\\n[Docker. Visual Studio automatically chooses smart defaults for ASP.NET applications and](https://www.docker.com/)\\nWindows Containers images. These tools offer both a rapid inner loop, and a fast path to get\\nthe containers to Azure. Your agility is improved when you deploy to multiple environments.\\n[Then, moving to production, you can deploy your Windows Containers to Azure Web App for](https://azure.microsoft.com/se\", \"rvices/app-service/containers/)\\n[Containers,](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/) [Azure Container Instances (ACI), and Azure VMs with Windows Server 2016 and](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-instances/)\\ncontainers if you prefer an IaaS approach. For more complex multi-container applications,\\n[consider using orchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS/ACS).](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/contai\", \"ner-service/)\\n\\n\\nDuring this initial modernization, you can also add assets from the cloud, such as monitoring with\\n[tools like Azure Application Insights; CI/CD pipelines for your app lifecycles with Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-overview)\\n[Services; and many more data resource services that are available in Azure. For instance, you can](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/)\\n[modify a mon\", \"olithic web app that was originally developed by using traditional ASP.NET Web Forms](https://www.asp.net/web-forms)\\n[or ASP.NET MVC, but now you deploy it by using Windows Containers. When you use Windows](https://www.asp.net/mvc)\\n[Containers, you should also migrate your data to a database in Azure SQL Database Managed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/)\\n[Instance, all without changing the core architecture of your application.](ht\", \"tps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/)\\n\\n\\n  - **Cloud-Native** [: As introduced, you should think about architecting cloud-native applications](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3181919/architect-design-cloudnative-applications)\\nwhen you are targeting large and complex applications with multiple independent\\ndevelopment teams working on different microservices that can be developed and deployed\\nautonomously. Also, due to granularized and independe\", \"nt scalability per microservice. These\\narchitectural approaches face very important challenges and complexities but can be greatly\\n[simplified by using cloud PaaS and orchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS/ACS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-service/)\\n[(managed Kubernetes), and Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) for a serverless approach. All these approaches\\n(like microservices and Server\", \"less) typically require you to architect for the cloud and write\\nnew code\\u2014code that is adapted to specific PaaS platforms, or code that aligns with specific\\narchitectures, like microservices.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1-3 shows the internal technologies that you can use for each maturity level:\\n\\n\\n_Figure 1-3. Internal technologies for each modernization maturity level_\\n### Lift and shift scenario\\n\\n\\nFor lift and shift migrations, keep in mind that you can use many\", \" different variations of lift and shift in\\nyour application scenarios. If you only rehost your application, you might have a scenario like the one\\nshown in Figure 1-4, where you use VMs in the cloud only for your application and for your database\\nserver.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 1-4. Example of a pure IaaS scenario in the cloud_\\n### Modernization scenarios\\n\\n\\nFor modernization scenarios, you might have a pure Cloud-Optimized application that uses elements\\nonly f\", \"rom that maturity level. Or, you might have an intermediate-state application with some\\nelements from Cloud Infrastructure-Ready and other elements from Cloud-Optimized (a \\u201cpick and\\nchoose\\u201d or mixed model), like in Figure 1-5.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 1-5. Example \\u201cpick and choose\\u201d scenario, with database on IaaS, DevOps, and containerization assets_\\n\\n\\nNext, as the ideal scenario for many existing .NET Framework applications to migrate, you could\\nmigrate to a C\", \"loud-Optimized application, to get significant benefits from little work. This approach\\nalso sets you up for Cloud-Native as a possible future evolution. Figure 1-6 shows an example.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 1-6. Example Cloud-Optimized apps scenario, with Windows Containers and managed services_\\n\\n\\nGoing even further, you could extend your existing Cloud-Optimized application by adding a few\\nmicroservices for specific scenarios. This approach would move you par\", \"tially to the level of CloudNative model, which is not the main focus of the present guidance.\\n### What this guide does not cover\\n\\n\\nThis guide covers a specific subset of the example scenarios, as shown in Figure 1-7. This guide\\nfocuses only on the lift and shift scenarios, and ultimately, on the Cloud-Optimized model. In the\\nCloud-Optimized model, a .NET Framework application is modernized by using Windows Containers,\\nplus additional components \", \"like monitoring and CI/CD pipelines. Each component is fundamental to\\ndeploying applications to the cloud, faster, and with agility.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 1-7. Cloud-Native is not covered in this guide_\\n\\n\\nThe focus of this guide is specific. It shows you the path you can take to achieve a lift and shift of your\\nexisting .NET applications, without rearchitecting, and with no code changes. Ultimately, it shows you\\nhow to make your application Cloud-Optimized.\\n\", \"\\n\\nThis guide doesn\\u2019t show you how to create Cloud-Native applications, such as how to evolve to a\\nmicroservices architecture.

simply rehost your existing applications in the cloud.\\n\\n\\nBefore getting into _how_ to migrate your existing applications to the Azure infrastructure as a service\\n(IaaS) platform, it\\u2019s important to analyze the reasons _why_ you\\u2019d want to migrate directly to IaaS in\\nAzure. The scenario at th\", \"is modernization maturity level essentially is to start using VMs in the cloud,\\ninstead of continuing to use your current, on-premises infrastructure.\\n\\n\\nAnother point to analyze is _why_ you might want to migrate to pure IaaS cloud instead of just adding\\nmore advanced managed services in Azure. Determine what cases might require IaaS in the first place.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-1 positions Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications in the modernization maturity l\", \"evels:\\n\\n\\n_Figure 2-1. Positioning Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications_\\n\\n\\n1 CHAPTER 1 | Lift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure IaaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready)\\n\\n\\n### Why migrate existing .NET web applications to Azure IaaS\\n\\nThe main reason to migrate to the cloud, even at an initial IaaS level, is to achieve cost reductions. By\\nusing more managed infrastructure services, your organization can lower its investment in hardware\\nmaintenance, \", \"server or VM provisioning and deployment, and infrastructure management.\\n\\n\\nAfter you make the decision to move your apps to the cloud, the main reason why you might choose\\nIaaS instead of more advanced options like PaaS is simply that the IaaS environment will be more\\nfamiliar. Moving to an environment that\\u2019s similar to your current, on-premises environment offers a\\nlower learning curve, which makes it the quickest path to the cloud.\\n\\n\\nHowever, t\", \"aking the quickest path to the cloud doesn\\u2019t mean that you will gain the most benefit from\\nhaving your applications running in the cloud. Any organization will gain the most significant benefits\\nfrom a cloud migration at the already introduced Cloud-Optimized and Cloud-Native maturity levels.\\n\\n\\nIt also has become evident that applications are easier to modernize and rearchitect in the future\\nwhen they are already running in the cloud, even on Iaa\", \"S. Application data migration has already been\\nachieved. Also, your organization will have gained the skills required for working in the cloud and\\nmade the shift to operating in a \\u201ccloud culture.\\u201d\\n\\n### When to migrate to IaaS instead of to PaaS\\n\\n\\nThe next sections discuss Cloud-Optimized applications that are mostly based on PaaS platforms and\\nservices. These apps give you the most benefits from migrating to the cloud.\\n\\n\\nIf your goal is simply to\", \" move existing applications to the cloud, first, identify existing applications that\\nwould not require substantial modification to run in Azure App Service. These apps should be the first\\ncandidates for Cloud-Optimized.\\n\\n\\nThen, for the apps that still cannot move to Windows Containers and PaaS such as App Service or\\norchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service, migrate those apps to simple plain VMs (IaaS).\\n\\n\\nBut, keep in mind that correctly confi\", \"guring, securing, and maintaining VMs requires much more time\\nand IT expertise compared to using PaaS services in Azure. If you are considering Azure Virtual\\nMachines, make sure that you take into account the ongoing maintenance effort required to patch,\\nupdate, and manage your VM environment. Azure Virtual Machines is IaaS.\\n\\n### Use Azure Migrate to analyze and migrate your existing applications to Azure\\n\\n\\nMigrating to the cloud doesn\\u2019t have to \", \"be difficult. But many organizations struggle to get started - to\\nget deep visibility into the environment and the tight interdependencies between applications,\\nworkloads, and data. Without that visibility, it can be difficult to plan the path forward. Without\\ndetailed information on what\\u2019s required for a successful migration, you can\\u2019t have the right\\n\\n\\n2 CHAPTER 1 | Lift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure IaaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready)\\n\\n\\nc\", \"onversations within your organization. You don\\u2019t know enough about the potential cost benefits, or\\nwhether workloads could just lift-and-shift or would require significant rework to migrate successfully.\\nNo wonder many organizations hesitate.\\n\\n\\n[Azure Migrate](https://aka.ms/azuremigrate) is a new service that provides the guidance, insights, and mechanisms needed to assist\\nyou in migrating to Azure. Azure Migrate provides:\\n\\n\\n  - Discovery and as\", \"sessment for on-premises virtual machines\\n\\n\\n  - Inbuilt dependency mapping for high-confidence discovery of multi-tier applications\\n\\n\\n  - Intelligent right sizing to Azure virtual machines\\n\\n\\n  - Compatibility reporting with guidelines for remediating potential issues\\n\\n\\n  - Integration with Azure Database Management Service for database discovery and migration\\n\\n\\nAzure Migrate gives you confidence that your workloads can migrate with minimal impact\", \" to the\\nbusiness and run as expected in Azure. With the right tools and guidance, you can achieve maximum\\nreturn on investment while assuring that critical performance and reliability needs are met.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-2 shows you the built-in dependency mapping for all server and application connections\\nperformed by Azure Migrate.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 2-2. Positioning Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications_\\n\\n### Use Azure Site Recovery to migrate your existing VMs\", \" to Azure VMs\\n\\n\\n[As part of the end-to-end Azure Migrate,](https://aka.ms/azuremigrate) [Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview) is a tool that you can use to easily\\nmigrate your web apps to VMs in Azure. You can use Site Recovery to replicate on-premises VMs and\\nphysical servers to Azure, or to replicate them to a secondary on-premises location. You can even\\nreplicate a workload that\\u2019s running \", \"on a supported Azure VM, on an on-premises _Hyper-V_ VM, on a\\n_VMware_ VM, or on a Windows or Linux physical server. Replication to Azure eliminates the cost and\\ncomplexity of maintaining a secondary datacenter.\\n\\n\\n3 CHAPTER 1 | Lift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure IaaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready)\\n\\n\\nSite Recovery is also made specifically for hybrid environments that are partly on-premises and partly\\non Azure. Site Recovery helps ensure bus\", \"iness continuity by keeping your apps that are running on\\nVMs and on-premises physical servers available if a site goes down. It replicates workloads that are\\nrunning on VMs and physical servers so that they remain available in a secondary location if the\\nprimary site isn\\u2019t available. It recovers workloads to the primary site when it\\u2019s up and running again.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-3 shows the execution of multiple VM migrations by using Azure Site Recovery.\\n\\n\", \"\\n_Figure 2-3.

Azure SQL Database offers the managed\\ninstance and full database-as-a-service (DBaaS) options. Figure 3-1 shows the multiple relational\\ndatabase migration paths available in Azure.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 3-1. Database migration paths in Azure_\\n\\n\\n6 CHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relationa\", \"l databases to Azure\\n\\n\\n### When to migrate to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance\\n\\nIn most cases, Azure SQL Database Managed Instance will be your best option to consider when you\\nmigrate your data to Azure. If you are migrating SQL Server databases and need nearly 100%\\nassurance that you won\\u2019t need to rearchitect your application or make changes to your data or data\\naccess code, choose the Managed Instance feature of Azure SQL Database.\\n\\n\\nAzure \", \"SQL Database Managed Instance is the best option if you have additional requirements for SQL\\nServer instance-level functionality, or isolation requirements beyond the features provided in a\\nstandard Azure SQL Database (single database model). This last one is the most PaaS-oriented choice,\\nbut it doesn\\u2019t offer the same features as that of a traditional SQL server. Migration might surface\\nfrictions.\\n\\n\\nFor example, an organization that has made dee\", \"p investments in instance-level SQL Server capabilities\\nwould benefit from migrating to SQL Managed Instance. Examples of instance-level SQL Server\\ncapabilities include SQL common language runtime (CLR) integration, SQL Server Agent, and crossdatabase querying. Support for these features is not available in standard Azure SQL Database (a\\nsingle-database model).\\n\\n\\nAn organization that operates in a highly regulated industry, and which needs to mai\", \"ntain isolation for\\nsecurity purposes, also might benefit from choosing the SQL Managed Instance model.\\n\\n\\nManaged Instance in Azure SQL Database has the following characteristics:\\n\\n\\n  - Security isolation through Azure Virtual Network\\n\\n\\n  - Application surface compatibility, with these features:\\n\\n\\n     - SQL Server Agent and SQL Server Profiler\\n\\n\\n     - Cross-database references and queries, SQL CLR, replication, change data capture\\n(CDC), and Se\", \"rvice Broker\\n\\n\\n  - Database sizes up to 35 TB\\n\\n\\n  - Minimum-downtime migration, with these features:\\n\\n\\n     - Azure Database Migration Service\\n\\n\\n     - Native backup and restore, and log shipping\\n\\n\\nWith these capabilities, when you migrate existing application databases to Azure SQL Database, the\\nManaged Instance model offers nearly 100% of the benefits of PaaS for SQL Server. Managed Instance\\nis a SQL Server environment where you continue using \", \"instance-level capabilities without changing\\nyour application design.\\n\\n\\nManaged Instance is probably the best fit for enterprises that currently are using SQL Server, and\\nwhich require flexibility in their network security in the cloud. It\\u2019s like having a private virtual network\\nfor your SQL databases.\\n\\n\\n7 CHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure\\n\\n\\n### When to migrate to Azure SQL Database\\n\\nAs mentioned, the standard Azure SQL Datab\", \"ase is a fully managed, relational DBaaS. SQL Database\\ncurrently manages millions of production databases, across 38 datacenters, around the world. It\\nsupports a broad range of applications and workloads, from managing straightforward transactional\\ndata, to driving the most data-intensive, mission-critical applications that require advanced data\\nprocessing at a global scale.\\n\\n\\nBecause of its full PaaS features, better pricing-and ultimately lower\", \" cost-you should move to the\\nstandard Azure SQL Database as your \\u201cby-default choice\\u201d if you have an application that uses basic,\\nstandard SQL databases, and no additional instance features. SQL Server features like SQL CLR\\nintegration, SQL Server Agent, and cross-database querying are not supported in the standard Azure\\nSQL Database. Those features are available only in the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance model.\\n\\n\\nAzure SQL Database is the on\", \"ly intelligent cloud database service that\\u2019s built for app developers. It\\u2019s\\nalso the only cloud database service that scales on-the-fly, without downtime, to help you efficiently\\ndeliver multitenant apps. Ultimately, Azure SQL Database leaves you more time to innovate, and it\\naccelerates your time to market. You can build secure apps and connect to your SQL database by\\nusing the languages and platforms that you prefer.\\n\\n\\nAzure SQL Database offers\", \" the following benefits:\\n\\n\\n  - Built-in intelligence (machine learning) that learns and adapts to your app\\n\\n\\n  - On-demand database provisioning\\n\\n\\n  - A range of offers, for all workloads\\n\\n\\n  - 99.99% availability SLA, zero maintenance\\n\\n\\n  - Geo-replication and restore services for data protection\\n\\n\\n  - Azure SQL Database Point in Time Restore feature\\n\\n\\n  - Compatibility with SQL Server 2016, including hybrid and migration\\n\\n\\nThe standard Azure SQ\", \"L Database is closer to PaaS than Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.\\nPrefer the standard Azure SQL Database because you\\u2019ll get more benefits from a managed cloud.\\nHowever, Azure SQL Database has some key differences from regular and on-premises SQL Server\\ninstances. Depending on your existing application\\u2019s database requirements, and your enterprise\\nrequirements and policies, it might not be the best choice when you are planning your migration t\", \"o\\nthe cloud.\\n\\n### When to move your original RDBMS to a VM (IaaS)\\n\\n\\nOne of your migration options is to move your original relational database management system\\n(RDBMS), including Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, to a similar server that\\u2019s\\nrunning on an Azure VM. If you have existing applications that require the fastest migration to the\\ncloud with minimal changes, or no changes at all, a direct migration to IaaS in the cloud mi\", \"ght be a\\n\\n\\n8 CHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure\\n\\n\\nfair option. It might not be the best way to take advantage of all the cloud\\u2019s benefits, but it\\u2019s probably\\nthe fastest initial path.\\n\\n\\n[Currently, Microsoft Azure supports up to 331 different database servers](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/category/databases?page=1&subcategories=databases-all) deployed as IaaS VMs. These\\ninclude popular RDBMS like SQL \", \"Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM DB2, and many other\\nNoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, DataStax, MariaDB, and Cloudera.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### When to migrate to SQL Server as a VM (IaaS)\\n\\nThere might be a few cases where you still need to migrate to SQL Server as a regular VM. An\\nexample scenario is if you need to use SQL Server Reporting Services. In most cases, though, Azure\\nSQL Database Managed Instance can provide everything you need to mi\", \"grate from on-premises SQL\\nservers, so migration to a SQL Server VM should be your last resort to try.\\n\\n### Use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate your relational databases to Azure\\n\\n\\nYou can use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate relational databases like SQL Server, and\\nMySQL to Azure, whether your target database is Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Database Managed\\nInstance, or SQL Server on an Azure VM.\\n\\n\\nThe automated workflow\", \", with assessment reporting, guides you through the changes you need to\\nmake before you migrate the database. When you are ready, the service migrates the source database\\nto Azure.\\n\\n\\nWhenever you change an original RDBMS, you might need to retest. You also might need to change\\nthe SQL sentences or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) code in your application, depending on\\ntesting results.\\n\\n\\nIf you have any other database (for example, IBM DB2) and you\", \" opt for a lift and shift approach, you\\nmight want to continue using those databases as IaaS VMs in Azure, unless you are willing to perform\\na more complex data migration. A more complex data migration will require additional effort because\\nyou\\u2019d be migrating to a different database type with the new schema and different programming\\nlibraries.\\n\\n\\n9 CHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure\\n\\n\\n### Additional resources\\n\\n\\n  - **Choose a c\", \"loud SQL Server option: Azure SQL Database (PaaS) or SQL Server on Azure**\\n**VM (IaaS)**\\n\\n\\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-paas-vs-sql-server-iaas](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-paas-vs-sql-server-iaas)\\n\\n\\n  - **SQL Server database migration to SQL Database in the cloud**\\n\\n\\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-cloud-migrate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-datab\", \"ase/sql-database-cloud-migrate)\\n\\n\\n  - **Azure SQL Database**\\n\\n\\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/?v=16.50](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/?v=16.50)\\n\\n\\n  - **SQL Server on virtual machines**\\n\\n\\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/)\\n\\n\\n10 CHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure\\n\\n\\n**CHAPTER**\\n# 3\\n\\n## Modern\", \"ize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\nVision: Modernize your existing .NET Framework applications to Cloud-Optimized applications to\\ndrastically improve your deployment agility, so you can ship faster and lower application\\u2019s delivery\\ncosts.\\n\\n\\nTo take advantage of the benefits of the cloud and new technologies like containers, you should at\\nleast partially modernize your existing .NET applications. Ultimately, modernizing your e\", \"nterprise\\napplications will lower your total cost of ownership.\\n\\n\\nPartially modernizing an app doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean a full migration and rearchitecture. You can\\ninitially modernize your existing applications with important but easy to do modernization. You can\\nmaintain your current code base, written in existing .NET Framework versions, with any Windows and\\nIIS dependencies. Figure 4-1 highlights how Cloud-Optimized apps are positioned in Azu\", \"re\\napplication modernization maturity models.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 4-1. Positioning Cloud-Optimized applications_\\n\\n\\n11 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n### Reasons to modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud- Optimized applications\\n\\nWith a Cloud-Optimized application, you can rapidly and repeatedly deliver reliable applications to\\nyour customers. You gain essential agility and reliability by deferring much of the opera\", \"tional\\ncomplexity of your app to the platform.\\n\\n\\nIf you can\\u2019t get your applications to market quickly, by the time you ship your app, the market you\\nwere targeting will have evolved. You might be too late, no matter how well the application was\\narchitected or engineered. You might be failing or not reaching your full potential because you can\\u2019t\\nsync app delivery with the needs of the market.\\n\\n\\nThe need for continuous business innovation pushes de\", \"velopment and operations teams to the limit.\\nThe only way to achieve the agility you need in continuous business innovation is by modernizing\\nyour applications with technologies like containers and specific Cloud-Optimized application\\nprinciples.\\n\\n\\nThe bottom line is that when an organization builds and manages applications that are CloudOptimized, it can put solutions in the hands of customers sooner and bring new ideas to market when\\nthey are r\", \"elevant.\\n\\n#### **Cloud-Optimized application principles and tenets**\\n\\n\\nImprovements in the cloud are mostly focused on meeting two goals: Reduce costs and improve\\nbusiness growth by improving agility. These goals are achieved by simplifying processes and reducing\\nfriction when you release and ship applications.\\n\\n\\nYour application is Cloud-Optimized if you can-in an agile manner-develop your app autonomously\\nfrom other on-premises apps, and then r\", \"elease, deploy, autoscale, monitor, and troubleshoot your\\napp in the cloud.\\n\\n\\nThe key is _agility_ . You can\\u2019t ship with agility unless you reduce to an absolute minimum any\\ndeployment-to-production issues and dev/test environment issues. Containers (specifically, Docker, as\\na de facto standard) and managed services were designed specifically for this purpose.\\n\\n\\nTo achieve agility, you also need automated DevOps processes that are based on CI/CD \", \"pipelines that\\nrelease to scalable platforms in the cloud. CI/CD platforms (like Azure DevOps Services or Jenkins) that\\ndeploy to a scalable and resilient cloud platform (like Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service)\\nare key technologies for achieving agility in the cloud.\\n\\n\\nThe following list describes the main tenets or practices for Cloud-Optimized applications. Note that\\nyou can adopt all or only some of these principles, in a progressi\", \"ve or incremental approach:\\n\\n\\n  - **Containers** . Containers give you the ability to include application dependencies with the\\napplication itself. Containerization significantly reduces the number of issues you might\\nencounter when you deploy to production environments or test in staging environments.\\nUltimately, containers improve the agility of application delivery.\\n\\n\\n12 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\", \"\\n\\n  - **Resilient and scalable cloud** . The cloud provides a platform that is managed, elastic,\\nscalable, and resilient. These characteristics are fundamental to gain cost improvements and\\nship highly available and reliable applications in a continuous delivery. Managed services like\\nmanaged databases, managed cache as a service (CaaS), and managed storage are\\nfundamental pieces in alleviating the maintenance costs of your application.\\n\\n\\n  - **M\", \"onitoring** . You can\\u2019t have a reliable application without having a good way to detect and\\ndiagnose exceptions and application performance issues. You need to get actionable insights\\nthrough application performance management and instant analytics.\\n\\n\\n  - **DevOps culture and continuous delivery** . Adopting DevOps practices requires a cultural\\nchange in which teams no longer work in independent silos. CI/CD pipelines are possible only\\nwhen there\", \" is an increased collaboration between development and IT operations teams,\\nsupported by containers and CI/CD tools.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-2 shows the main optional pillars of a Cloud-Optimized application. The more pillars you\\nimplement, the readier your application will be to succeed in meeting your customers\\u2019 expectations.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 4-2. Main pillars of a Cloud-Optimized application_\\n\\n\\nTo summarize, a Cloud-Optimized application is an approach to buildin\", \"g and managing applications\\nthat takes advantage of the cloud computing model, while using a combination of containers,\\nmanaged cloud infrastructure, resilient application techniques, monitoring, continuous delivery, and\\nDevOps, all without the need to rearchitect and recode your existing applications.\\n\\n\\nYour organization can adopt these technologies and approaches gradually. You don\\u2019t have to\\nembrace all of them, all at once. You can adopt them \", \"incrementally, depending on enterprise priorities\\nand user needs.\\n\\n\\n13 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n#### **Benefits of a Cloud-Optimized application**\\n\\nYou can get the following benefits by converting an existing application to a Cloud-Optimized\\napplication (without rearchitecting or coding):\\n\\n\\n  - **Lower costs, because the managed infrastructure is handled by the cloud provider** .\\nCloud-Optimized a\", \"pplications get the benefits of the cloud by using the cloud\\u2019s out-of-thebox elasticity, autoscale, and high availability. Benefits are related not only to the compute\\nfeatures (VMs and containers), but also depend on the resources in the cloud, like DBaaS,\\nCaaS, and any infrastructure an application might needed.\\n\\n\\n  - **Resilient application and infrastructure** . When you migrate to the cloud, you need to\\nembrace transient failures; failures w\", \"ill occur in the cloud. Also, cloud infrastructure and\\nhardware are \\u201creplaceable,\\u201d which increases opportunities for transient downtime. At the\\nsame time, inner cloud capabilities and certain application development techniques that\\nimplement resiliency and automate recovery make it much easier to recover from unexpected\\nfailures in the cloud.\\n\\n\\n  - **Deeper insights into application performance** . Cloud monitoring tools like Azure\\nApplication In\", \"sights provide visualization for health management, logging, and notifications.\\nAudit logs make applications easy to debug and audit, fundamental for a reliable cloud\\napplication.\\n\\n\\n  - **Application portability, with agile deployments** . Containers (either Linux or Windows\\ncontainers based on Docker Engine) offer the best solution to avoiding a cloud-locked\\napplication. By using containers, Docker hosts, and multi-cloud orchestrators, you can e\", \"asily\\nmove from one environment or cloud to another. Containers eliminate the friction that\\ntypically occurs in deployments to any environment (stage/test/production).\\n\\n\\nAll of these benefits ultimately provide key cost reductions for your end-to-end application lifecycle.\\n\\n\\nIn the following sections, these benefits are explained in more detail, and are linked to specific\\ntechnologies.\\n\\n### Microsoft technologies in cloud-optimized applications\\n\\n\", \"\\nThe following list describes the tools, technologies, and solutions that are recognized as requirements\\nfor Cloud-Optimized apps. You can adopt Cloud-Optimized elements selectively or gradually,\\ndepending on your priorities.\\n\\n\\n  - **Cloud infrastructure** : The infrastructure that provides the compute platform, operating\\nsystem, network, and storage. Microsoft Azure is positioned at this level.\\n\\n\\n  - **Runtime** : This layer provides the environ\", \"ment for the application to run. If you are using\\n[containers, this layer usually is based on Docker Engine, running either on Linux hosts or on](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)\\n[Windows hosts. (Windows Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/) are supported beginning with Windows Server 2016.\\n\\n\\n14 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\nWindows Containers is the best choic\", \"e for existing .NET Framework applications that run on\\nWindows.)\\n\\n\\n  - **Managed cloud** : When you choose a managed cloud option, you can avoid the expense and\\ncomplexity of managing and supporting the underlying infrastructure, VMs, OS patches, and\\nnetworking configuration. If you choose to migrate by using IaaS, you are responsible for all\\nof these tasks, and for associated costs. In a managed cloud option, you manage only the\\napplications and\", \" services that you develop. The cloud service provider typically manages\\n[everything else. Examples of managed cloud services in Azure include Azure SQL Database,](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database)\\n[Azure Redis Cache, Azure Cosmos DB,](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache/) [Azure Storage,](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) [Azure Database for MySQL, Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/mysql/)\\n[Database\", \" for PostgreSQL, Azure Active Directory, and managed compute services like VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/postgresql/)\\n[scale sets,](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machine-scale-sets/) [Azure App Service, and Azure Kubernetes Service.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/)\\n\\n\\n  - **Application development** : You can choose from many languages when you build\\n[applications that run in containers. This guide focu\", \"ses on .NET, but, you can develop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)\\ncontainer-based apps by using other languages, like Node.js, Python, Spring/Java, or Go.\\n\\n\\n  - **Monitoring, telemetry, logging, and auditing** : The ability to monitor and audit applications\\nand containers that are running in the cloud is critical for any Cloud-Optimized application.\\n[Azure Application Insights and Microsoft Operations Management Suite](https://azure.microsoft.com\", \"/services/application-insights/) are the main\\nMicrosoft tools that provide monitoring and auditing for Cloud-Optimized apps.\\n\\n\\n  - **Provisioning** : Automation tools help you provision the infrastructure and deploy an\\napplication to multiple environments (production, testing, staging). You can use tools like\\nChef and Puppet to manage an application\\u2019s configuration and environment. This layer also\\ncan be implemented by using simpler and more dire\", \"ct approaches. For example, you can\\ndeploy directly by using Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) tooling, and then use the\\n[continuous deployment and release management pipelines in Azure DevOps Services.](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/)\\n\\n\\n  - **Application lifecycle** : [Azure DevOps Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) and other tools, like Jenkins, are built\\nautomation servers that help you implement CI/CD\", \" pipelines, including release management.\\n\\n\\nThe next sections of this chapter, and the related walkthroughs, focus specifically on details about the\\nruntime layer (Windows Containers). The guidance describes the ways you can deploy Windows\\nContainers on Windows Server 2016 (and later versions) VMs and Azure Container Instances. It also\\ncovers more advanced PaaS platforms like Azure App Service and orchestrator like Azure Kubernetes\\nService.\\n\\n####\", \" **Monolithic applications can be Cloud-Optimized**\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s important to highlight that monolithic applications (applications that are not based on\\nmicroservices) _can_ be Cloud-Optimized applications. You can build and operate monolithic\\napplications that take advantage of the cloud computing model by using a combination of containers,\\ncontinuous delivery, and DevOps. If an existing monolithic application is right for your business goals,\\nyou can\", \" modernize it and make it Cloud-Optimized.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, if monolithic applications can be Cloud-Optimized applications, other, more complex\\narchitectures like N-Tier applications can also be modernized as Cloud-Optimized applications.\\n\\n\\n15 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n### What about Cloud-Native applications?\\n\\n[Although Cloud-Native](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/cloudnative/) applications are \", \"not the main focus of this guide, it\\u2019s helpful to have an\\nunderstanding of this modernization maturity level, and to distinguish it from Cloud-Optimized\\napplications.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-3 positions Cloud-Native apps in the application modernization maturity levels:\\n\\n\\n_Figure 4-3. Positioning Cloud-Native applications_\\n\\n\\nThe Cloud-Native modernization maturity level usually requires new development investments.\\nMoving to the Cloud-Native level typically i\", \"s driven by business need to modernize applications as\\nmuch as possible to drastically improve scale in large applications by creating autonomous\\nsubsystems (microservices) that can be deployed and scale independently from other areas of the\\napplication while lowering costs in the long term and increase evolution agility of those autonomous\\napp\\u2019s parts that provide significant compete advantages.\\n\\n\\nThe main pillars of Cloud-Native applications ar\", \"e based on microservices architecture approaches,\\nwhich can evolve with agility and scale to limits that would be difficult to achieve in a monolithic\\narchitecture, deployed to either on-premises or cloud environment.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-4 shows the main characteristics of the Cloud-Native model.\\n\\n\\n16 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n_Figure 4-4. Cloud-Native characteristics_\\n\\n\\nIn addition, you can extend basic mo\", \"dern web apps and cloud-native apps by adding other services,\\nlike artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and IoT. You might use any of these services to\\nextend any of the possible Cloud-Optimized approaches.\\n\\n\\nThe fundamental difference in applications at the Cloud-Native level is in the application architecture.\\nCloud-native applications are, by definition, apps that are based on microservices. Cloud-native apps\\nrequire special ar\", \"chitectures, technologies, and platforms, compared to a monolithic web application\\nor traditional N-Tier application.\\n\\n#### **Cloud-native applications details**\\n\\n\\nCloud-Native is a more advanced or mature state for large and mission-critical applications. CloudNative applications usually require architecture and design that are created from scratch instead of by\\nmodernizing existing applications. The key difference between a Cloud-Native applica\", \"tion and a\\nsimpler Cloud-Optimized web app is the recommendation to use microservices architectures in a\\ncloud-native approach. Cloud-Optimized apps can also be monolithic web apps or N-Tier apps.\\n\\n\\n[The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) (a collection of patterns that are closely related to microservices approaches)\\nis also considered a requirement for cloud-native application architectures.\\n\\n\\n[The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)\", \" is a primary promoter of cloud-native principles.](https://www.cncf.io/)\\n[Microsoft is a member of the CNCF.](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-cncf/)\\n\\n\\nFor detailed guidance on how to design and develop cloud-native applications, read the following\\nfree e-books:\\n\\n\\n17 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n  - [Architecting Cloud-Native .NET Applications for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/do\", \"tnet/architecture/cloud-native/introduction)\\n\\n  - [.NET Microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/)\\n\\n\\nThe most important factor to consider if you migrate a full application to the cloud-native model is\\nthat you must rearchitect to a microservices-based architecture. This approach clearly requires a\\nsignificant investment in development because of the large\", \" refactoring process involved. This option\\nusually is chosen for mission-critical applications that need new levels of scalability and long-term\\nagility. But, you could start moving toward cloud-native by adding microservices for just a few new\\nscenarios, and eventually refactor the application fully as microservices. This step is an incremental\\napproach that is the best option for some scenarios.\\n\\n#### **What about microservices?**\\n\\n\\nUnderstandi\", \"ng microservices and how they work is important when you are considering cloud-native\\napplications for your organization.\\n\\n\\nThe microservices architecture is an advanced approach that you can use for applications that are\\ncreated from scratch or when you evolve existing applications toward cloud-native applications. You\\ncan start by adding a few microservices to existing applications to learn about the new microservices\\nparadigms. But clearly, yo\", \"u need to architect and code, especially for this type of architectural\\napproach.\\n\\n\\nHowever, microservices are not mandatory for any new or modern application. Microservices are not a\\n\\u201cmagic bullet,\\u201d and they aren\\u2019t the single, best way to create every application. How and when you use\\nmicroservices depends on the type of application that you need to build.\\n\\n\\nThe microservices architecture is becoming the preferred approach for distributed and la\", \"rge or\\ncomplex mission-critical applications that are based on multiple, independent subsystems in the form\\nof autonomous services. In a microservices-based architecture, an application is built as a collection of\\nservices that can be independently developed, tested, versioned, deployed, and scaled. This approach\\ncan include any related, autonomous database per microservice.\\n\\n\\nFor a detailed look at a microservices architecture that you can imple\", \"ment by using .NET, see the\\n[downloadable PDF e-book .NET microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications. The](https://aka.ms/microservicesebook)\\n[guide also is available online.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/)\\n\\n\\nBut even in scenarios in which microservices offer powerful capabilities-independent deployment,\\nstrong subsystem boundaries, and technology diversity-they also raise many new challe\", \"nges. The\\nchallenges are related to distributed application development, such as fragmented and independent\\ndata models; achieving resilient communication between microservices; the need for eventual\\nconsistency; and operational complexity. Microservices introduce a higher level of complexity\\ncompared to traditional monolithic applications.\\n\\n\\nBecause of the complexity of a microservices architecture, only specific scenarios and certain\\napplicatio\", \"n types are suitable for microservice-based applications. These include large and complex\\napplications that have multiple, evolving subsystems. In these cases, it\\u2019s worth investing in a more\\ncomplex software architecture, for increased long-term agility and more efficient application\\nmaintenance. But for less complex scenarios, it might be better to continue with a monolithic\\napplication approach or simpler N-Tier approaches.\\n\\n\\n18 CHAPTER 3 | Mod\", \"ernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\nAs a final note, even at the risk of being repetitive about this concept, you shouldn\\u2019t look at using\\nmicroservices in your applications as \\u201call-in or nothing at all.\\u201d You can extend and evolve existing\\nmonolithic applications by adding new, small scenarios based on microservices. You don\\u2019t need to\\nstart from scratch to start working with a microservices architecture approach. In fact, w\", \"e recommend\\nthat you evolve from using an existing monolithic or N-Tier application by adding new scenarios.\\nEventually, you can break down the application into autonomous components or microservices. You\\ncan start evolving your monolithic applications in a microservices direction, step by step.\\n\\n\\nIn any case, the rest of this present guidance focuses most of all on \\u201cno microservices-based apps\\u201d\\nbecause this guidance is mainly targeting the moder\", \"nization of existing apps that usually have\\nmonolithic or N-Tier architectures.\\n\\n### Deploy existing .NET apps as Windows containers\\n\\n\\nDeployments that are based on Windows Containers are applicable to Cloud-Optimized applications\\nand Cloud-Native applications.\\n\\n\\nHowever, in this guide and especially in the following sections, it mostly focuses on using Windows\\nContainers for _Cloud-Optimized_ applications where you don\\u2019t need to rearchitect your\", \" application.\\n\\n#### **What are containers? (Linux or Windows)**\\n\\n\\nContainers are a way to wrap up an application into its own isolated package. In its container, the\\napplication is not affected by applications or processes that exist outside of the container. Everything\\nthe application depends on to run successfully as a process is inside the container. Wherever the\\ncontainer might move, the requirements of the application will always be met, in \", \"terms of direct\\ndependencies, because it is bundled with everything that it needs to run (library dependencies,\\nruntimes, and so on).\\n\\n\\nThe main characteristic of a container is that it makes the environment the same across different\\ndeployments because the container itself comes with all the dependencies it needs. You can debug\\nthe application on your machine, and then deploy it to another machine, with the same environment\\nguaranteed.\\n\\n\\nA conta\", \"iner is an instance of a container image. A container image is a way to package an app or\\nservice (like a snapshot), and then deploy it in a reliable and reproducible way. You could say that\\nDocker is not only a technology-it\\u2019s also a philosophy and a process.\\n\\n\\nAs containers daily become more common, they are becoming an industry-wide \\u201cunit of deployment.\\u201d\\n\\n#### **Benefits of containers (Docker Engine on Linux or Windows)**\\n\\n\\nBuilding applicatio\", \"ns by using containers-which also might be defined as lightweight building blocksoffers a significant increase in agility for building, shipping, and running any application, across any\\ninfrastructure.\\n\\n\\nWith containers, you can take any app from development to production with little or no code change,\\nthanks to Docker integration across Microsoft developer tools, operating systems, and the cloud.\\n\\n\\n19 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to \", \"Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\nWhen you deploy to plain VMs, you probably already have a method in place for deploying ASP.NET\\napps to your VMs. It\\u2019s likely, though, that your method involves multiple manual steps or complex\\nautomated processes by using a deployment tool like Puppet, or a similar tool. You might need to\\nperform tasks like modifying configuration items, copying application content between servers, and\\nrunning interactive setup pro\", \"grams based on .msi setups, followed by testing. All those steps in the\\ndeployment add time and risk to deployments. You will get failures whenever a dependency is not\\npresent in the target environment.\\n\\n\\nIn Windows Containers, the process of packaging applications is fully automated. Windows Containers\\nis based on the Docker platform, which offers automatic updates and rollbacks for container\\ndeployments. The main improvement you get from using \", \"the Docker engine is that you create images,\\nwhich are like snapshots of your application, with all its dependencies. The images are Docker images\\n(a Windows container image, in this case). The images run ASP.NET apps in containers, without going\\nback to source code. The container snapshot becomes the unit of deployment.\\n\\n\\nMany organizations are containerizing existing monolithic applications for the following reasons:\\n\\n\\n  - **Release agility thr\", \"ough improved deployment** . Containers offer a consistent deployment\\ncontract between development and operations. When you use containers, you won\\u2019t hear\\ndevelopers say, \\u201cIt works on my machine, why not in production?\\u201d They can say, \\u201cIt runs as a\\ncontainer, so it will run in production.\\u201d The packaged application, with all its dependencies,\\ncan be executed in any supported container-based environment. It will run the way it was\\nintended to run in\", \" all deployment targets (dev, QA, staging, production). Containers eliminate\\nmost frictions when they move from one stage to the next, which greatly improves\\ndeployment, and you can ship faster.\\n\\n\\n  - **Cost reductions** . Containers lead to lower costs, either by the consolidation and removal of\\nexisting hardware, or from running applications at a higher density per unit of hardware.\\n\\n\\n  - **Portability** . Containers are modular and portable. D\", \"ocker containers are supported on any\\nserver operating system (Linux and Windows), in any major public cloud (Microsoft Azure,\\nAmazon AWS, Google, IBM), and in on-premises and private or hybrid cloud environments.\\n\\n\\n  - **Control** . Containers offer a flexible and secure environment that\\u2019s controlled at the container\\nlevel. A container can be secured, isolated, and even limited by setting execution constraint\\npolicies on the container. As detail\", \"ed in the section about Windows Containers, Windows\\nServer 2016 and Hyper-V containers offer additional enterprise support options.\\n\\n\\nSignificant improvements in agility, portability, and control ultimately lead to significant cost\\nreductions when you use containers to develop and maintain applications.\\n\\n#### **What is Docker?**\\n\\n\\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) [is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications as portabl\", \"e, self-](https://github.com/docker/docker)\\n[sufficient containers that can run in the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a company that](https://www.docker.com/)\\npromotes and evolves this technology. The company works in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and\\nWindows vendors, including Microsoft.\\n\\n\\n20 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n_Figure 4-6. Docker deploys containers at all layers of the hybrid clou\", \"d_\\n\\n\\nTo someone familiar with virtual machines, containers might appear to be remarkably similar. A\\ncontainer runs an operating system, has a file system, and can be accessed over a network, just like a\\nphysical or virtual computer system. However, the technology and concepts behind containers are\\nvastly different from virtual machines. From a developer point of view, a container must be treated\\nmore like a single process. In fact, a container ha\", \"s a single entry point for one process.\\n\\n\\nDocker containers (for simplicity, _containers_ ) can run natively on Linux and Windows. When running\\nregular containers, Windows containers can run only on Windows hosts (a host server or a VM), and\\nLinux containers can run only on Linux hosts. However, in recent versions of Windows Server and\\nHyper-V containers, a Linux container can also run natively on Windows Server by using the Hyper-V\\nisolation tec\", \"hnology that currently is available only in Windows Server Containers.\\n\\n\\nIn the near future, mixed environments that have both Linux and Windows containers will be possible\\nand even common.\\n\\n#### **Benefits of Windows Containers for your existing .NET applications**\\n\\n\\nThe benefits of using Windows Containers are fundamentally the same benefits you get from\\ncontainers in general. Using Windows Containers is about greatly improving agility, portabi\", \"lity, and\\ncontrol.\\n\\n\\nExisting .NET applications refer to those applications that were created using the .NET Framework. For\\nexample, they might be traditional ASP.NET web applications-they don\\u2019t use .NET Core or .NET 5+,\\nwhich is newer and runs cross-platform on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.\\n\\n\\nThe main dependency in the .NET Framework is Windows. It also has secondary dependencies, like IIS,\\nand System.Web in traditional ASP.NET.\\n\\n\\nA .NET Framework \", \"application must run on Windows, period. If you want to containerize existing .NET\\nFramework applications and you can\\u2019t or don\\u2019t want to invest in a migration to .NET Core or later(\\u201cIf it\\n\\n\\n21 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\nworks properly, don\\u2019t migrate it\\u201d), the only choice you have for containers is to use Windows\\nContainers.\\n\\n\\nSo, one of the main benefits of Windows Containers is that they offer you \", \"a way to modernize your\\nexisting .NET Framework applications that are running on Windows-through containerization.\\nUltimately, Windows Containers gets you the benefits that you are looking for by using containersagility, portability, and better control.\\n\\n#### **Choose an OS to target with .NET-based containers**\\n\\n\\nGiven the diversity of operating systems that are supported by Docker, as well as the differences\\nbetween .NET Framework and .NET Core\", \", you should target a specific OS and specific versions based\\non the framework you are using.\\n\\n\\nFor Windows, you can use Windows Server Core or Windows Nano Server. These Windows versions\\nprovide different characteristics (like IIS versus a self-hosted web server like Kestrel) that might be\\nneeded by .NET Framework or .NET applications.\\n\\n\\nFor Linux, multiple distros are available and supported in official .NET Docker images (like Debian).\\n\\n\\nFigur\", \"e 4-7 shows OS versions that you can target, depending on the app\\u2019s version of the .NET\\nFramework.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 4-7. Operating systems to target based on .NET Framework version_\\n\\n\\nIn migration scenarios for existing or legacy applications that are based on .NET Framework\\napplications, the main dependencies are on Windows and IIS. Your only option is to use Docker\\nimages based on Windows Server Core and the .NET Framework.\\n\\n\\nWhen you add the image na\", \"me to your Dockerfile file, you can select the operating system and\\nversion by using a tag, as in the following examples for .NET Framework-based Windows container\\nimages:\\n\\n\\n22 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n|Tag|System and version|\\n|---|---|\\n|**mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/runti**<br>**me:4.x-windowsservercore-20H2**|.NET Framework 4.x on Windows Server Core|\\n|**mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework\", \"/aspne**<br>**t:4.x-windowsservercore-20H2**|.NET Framework 4.x with additional ASP.NET<br>customization, on Windows Server Core|\\n\\n\\n\\nFor .NET (cross-platform for Linux and Windows), the tags would look like the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n|Tag|System and version|\\n|---|---|\\n|**mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0**|.NET runtime-only on Linux|\\n|**mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0-**<br>**nanoserver-ltsc2022**|.NET runtime-only on Windows Nano Server|\\n\\n\\n**Mult\", \"i-arch images**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Since 2017, Docker has had a feature called multi-arch](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15866) images. .NET Docker images can use multi-arch\\ntags. Your Dockerfile files no longer need to define the operating system that you are targeting. The\\nmulti-arch feature allows a single tag to be used across multiple machine configurations. For instance,\\nwith multi-arch, you can use one common tag: **mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runti\", \"me:7.0** . If you pull\\nthat tag from a Linux container environment, you get the Debian-based image. If you pull that tag\\nfrom a Windows container environment, you get the Nano Server-based image.\\n\\n\\nFor .NET Framework images, because the traditional .NET Framework supports only Windows, you\\ncannot use the multi-arch feature.\\n\\n#### **Windows container types**\\n\\n\\nLike Linux containers, Windows Server containers are managed by using Docker Engine. Unl\", \"ike Linux\\ncontainers, Windows containers include two different container types, or run times-Windows Server\\ncontainers and Hyper-V isolation.\\n\\n\\n**Windows Server containers** : Provides application isolation through process and namespace isolation\\ntechnology. A Windows Server container shares a kernel with the container host and all containers\\nthat are running on the host. These containers do not provide a hostile security boundary and should\\nnot \", \"be used to isolate untrusted code. Because of the shared kernel space, these containers require\\nthe same kernel version and configuration.\\n\\n\\n**Hyper-V isolation** : Expands on the isolation provided by Windows Server Containers by running each\\ncontainer on a highly optimized VM. In this configuration, the kernel of the container host is not\\nshared with other containers on the same host. These containers are designed for hostile multitenant\\nhostin\", \"g, with the same security assurances of a VM. Because these containers don\\u2019t share the kernel\\nwith the host or other containers on the host, they can run kernels with different versions and\\nconfigurations (with supported versions). For example, all Windows containers on Windows 10 use\\nHyper-V isolation to utilize the Windows Server kernel version and configuration.\\n\\n\\n23 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\nRu\", \"nning a container on Windows with or without Hyper-V isolation is a run-time decision. You might\\nchoose to create the container with Hyper-V isolation initially, and at run time, choose to run it as a\\nWindows Server container instead.\\n\\n\\n**Additional resources**\\n\\n\\n  - **Windows Containers documentation**\\n\\n\\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/)\\n\\n\\n  - **Windows C\", \"ontainers fundamentals**\\n\\n\\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/)\\n\\n\\n  - **Infographic: Microsoft and containers**\\n\\n\\n[https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/Container%20infographic%201.4.17.pdf](https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/Container%20infographic%201.4.17.pdf)\\n\\n#### **The container ecosystem in Azure**\\n\\n\\nIn previous sec\", \"tions, it\\u2019s been explained what the benefits of Docker containers are as well as details\\non the specific container images for .NET applications. All that generic information is fundamental in\\norder to develop or containerize an application. However, when thinking about the production\\ndeployment environment or even QA and Dev/Test environments, Microsoft Azure provides an open\\nand broad variety of choices, a full container ecosystem in the cloud (\", \"shown in the diagram below).\\nDepending on your specific application\\u2019s needs, you should choose one or another Azure product.\\n\\n\\n24 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n_Figure 4-7.5. The container ecosystem in Azure_\\n\\n\\nFrom the container ecosystem in Azure, the following products supporting containers that are\\nconsidered infrastructure:\\n\\n\\n  - **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**\\n\\n  - **Azure Virtual Machines** \", \"(With container\\u2019s support)\\n\\n  - **Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets** (With container\\u2019s support)\\n\\n\\nFrom those three, ACI provides a great benefit, which is the fact that you don\\u2019t need to maintain the\\nunderlying OS, no need for you to upgrade/patch, etc. but ACI still is positioned in the infrastructure\\nlevel, as better explained in the upcoming sections of this book.\\n\\n\\nThe products in Azure supporting containers that are at the same time position\", \"ed more in the PaaS\\n(Platform as a Service) level are:\\n\\n\\n  - **Azure App Service**\\n\\n  - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS and ACS)**\\n\\n  - **Azure Batch**\\n\\n\\nThen, Azure Container Registry is a high scalable container registry hosted in Azure that you can use\\nfrom all the previous products when registering and deploying your custom container images.\\n\\n\\nIn addition, from your containers, you can consume other managed services in Azure like Azure SQL\\nDa\", \"tabase, Azure Redis cache, Azure Cosmos DB, etc. plus there are third-party solutions/platforms\\n\\n\\n25 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\navailable in Azure Marketplace like Cloud Foundry and OpenShift where you can also use containers\\nwithin Azure.\\n\\n\\nIn the next sections, you can explore Microsoft\\u2019s recommendations on when to use each of those\\nAzure products and solutions specifically when targeting Windows \", \"Containers.\\n\\n### When not to deploy to Windows Containers\\n\\n\\nSome Windows technologies are not supported by Windows Containers. In those cases, you still need\\nto migrate to the standards VMs, usually with just Windows and IIS.\\n\\n\\n[For more information, see the list of Applications not supported by Windows containers.](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/lift-shift-to-containers#applications-not-supported-by-conta\", \"iners)\\n\\n\\n**Additional resources**\\n\\n\\n  - **Virtual machines and containers in Azure**\\n\\n\\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/containers/](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/containers/)\\n\\n### When to deploy Windows Containers in your on- premises IaaS VM infrastructure\\n\\n\\n  - Your organization might not be ready to move to the cloud, or it might not be able to move\\nto the cloud for a business reason. But, you can still get the benefits of using W\", \"indows\\nContainers in your own datacenters.\\n\\n\\n  - You might have other artifacts that are being used on-premises, and which might slow you\\ndown when you try to move to the cloud. For example, security or authentication\\ndependencies with on-premises Windows Server Active Directory, or any other on-premises\\nasset.\\n\\n\\n  - If you start using Windows Containers today, you can make a phased migration to the cloud\\ntomorrow from a much better position. Win\", \"dows Containers is becoming a unit of\\ndeployment for any cloud, with no lock-in.\\n\\n### When to deploy Windows Containers to Azure VMs (IaaS cloud)\\n\\n\\nIf your organization is using Azure VMs, even if you are also using Windows Containers, you are still\\ndealing with IaaS. That means that dealing with infrastructure operations, VM OS patches, and\\ninfrastructure complexity for highly scalable applications when you need to deploy to multiple VMs in\\na lo\", \"ad-balanced infrastructure. The main scenarios for using Windows Containers in an Azure VM are:\\n\\n\\n  - **Dev/test environment** : A VM in the cloud is perfect for development and testing in the\\ncloud. You can rapidly create or stop the environment depending on your needs.\\n\\n\\n26 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n  - **Small and medium scalability needs** : In scenarios where you might need just a couple of\\nVM\", \"s for your production environment, managing a few VMs might be affordable until you\\ncan move to more advanced PaaS environments, like orchestrators.\\n\\n\\n  - **Production environment with existing deployment tools** : You might be moving from an\\non-premises environment in which you have invested in tools to make complex deployments\\nto VMs or bare-metal servers (like Puppet or similar tools). To move to the cloud with minimal\\nchanges to production en\", \"vironment deployment procedures, you might continue to use\\nthose tools to deploy to Azure VMs. However, you\\u2019ll want to use Windows Containers as the\\nunit of deployment to improve the deployment experience.\\n\\n### When to deploy Windows Containers to Azure Container Instances (ACI)\\n\\n\\nThe main value proposition of Azure Container Instances is that you can right away deploy containers\\nto it and you don\\u2019t need to maintain that environment, you don\\u2019t ne\", \"ed to upgrade/patch the\\nunderlying operating system or VMs, all that is transparent and you just deploy containers into a\\nready-to-use environment.\\n\\n\\nThe reasons and scenarios when you would want to use ACI are similar to the main scenarios when\\nyou use Azure VMs with containers, so basically, the main scenarios for using Azure Container\\nInstances are:\\n\\n\\n  - **Dev/Test scenarios**\\n\\n  - **Task automation**\\n\\n  - **CI/CD agents**\\n\\n  - **Small/scale \", \"batch processing**\\n\\n  - **Simple web apps**\\n\\n\\nThe simple web apps scenario is a fair scenario for ACI but take into account that since in ACI you can\\nonly have a single container instance per container image, you won\\u2019t have high availability and only\\nhave limited scalability.\\n\\n\\nHowever, even when ACI is considered infrastructure because it just provides single container\\ninstances, there is a huge benefit compared to regular Azure VMs with Windows\", \" Server. With ACI, you\\njust deploy the containers into a self-maintained environment and you just pay for those containers.\\nYou don\\u2019t need to maintain/update/patch VMs, so it is a much better platform for most scenarios\\nwhere you might be using VMs with containers. Using ACI is straight forward, you just deploy a\\ncontainer, there\\u2019s no need to create a VM environment you just deploy containers.\\n\\n\\nThe main benefits of Azure Container Instances (ACI\", \") are:\\n\\n\\n  - Run containers without managing servers\\n\\n  - Increase agility with containers on demand\\n\\n  - Deploy containers to the cloud with unprecedented simplicity and speed\\u2014with a single\\ncommand.\\n\\n\\n27 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\n  - Secure applications with hypervisor isolation\\n\\n\\nIn short, with ACI you can develop apps fast without managing virtual machines or having to learn\\nnew tools. It\\u2019s just\", \" your application, in a container, running in the cloud.\\n\\n### When to deploy Windows Containers to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\\n\\n\\nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by\\noffloading the operational overhead to Azure. You get an open solution that offers portability both for\\nyour containers and for your application configuration. You select the size, the number of hosts, and\\nthe orchestrator to\", \"ols. Azure Kubernetes Service handles the infrastructure for you. It also supports\\nWindows Server containers alongside Linux containers. For more details on Windows OS support and\\n[the feature differences between Windows and Linux, read the FAQ.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/windows-faq)\\n\\n\\nThe main benefits of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) are:\\n\\n\\n  - Identity and security management\\n\\n  - Integrated logging and monitoring\\n\\n  - Cluster nod\", \"e and pod scaling.\\n\\n  - Ingress with HTTP application routing\\n\\n  - AKS supports the Docker image format. For private storage of your Docker images, you can\\nintegrate AKS with Azure Container Registry (ACR).\\n\\nIf you are already working with open-source orchestrators like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or DC/OS,\\nyou don\\u2019t need to change your existing management practices to move container workloads to the\\ncloud. Use the application management tools that\", \" you\\u2019re already familiar with and connect via the\\nstandard API endpoints for the orchestrator of your choice.\\n\\n### Choosing Azure compute platforms for container- based applications\\n\\n\\nAs you have noticed after reading the previous sections, Azure is an open cloud that offers multiple\\nchoices. You can use the best fit for your needs, however, it also surfaces questions about what\\nproduct/technology you should use for your containerized application\", \"s.\\n\\n\\nAs a _by-default_ recommendation, the following is the main criteria recommended in this guidance:\\n\\n\\n  - **Single monolithic app:** Choose Azure App Service\\n\\n  - **N-Tier app:** Choose orchestrators such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or App Service if\\nyou have a single or a few back-end services\\n\\n  - **Microservices:** Choose AKS or Azure Web Apps for Containers\\n\\n  - **Serverless functions & event handlers:** Choose Azure Functions\\n\\n  - \", \"**Large-scale Batch:** Choose Azure Batch\\n\\n\\n28 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\nHowever, this recommendation should be taken with a pinch of salt, as the product\\u2019s selection will\\ndepend on your specific application\\u2019s needs and characteristics. Not all applications are the same even\\nwhen initially they might look similar types.\\n\\n\\nAfter a deeper analysis of the application\\u2019s needs, the product selected coul\", \"d be different. But, as a\\nstarting point, it is good to have initial guidance from where you can start evaluating and testing\\nbased on certain priority.\\n\\n\\n**Additional resources**\\n\\n\\n  - **Choose an Azure compute service for your application**\\n\\n\\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-tree)\\ntree\\n\\n### Build res\", \"ilient services ready for the cloud: Embrace transient failures in the cloud\\n\\n\\nResiliency is the ability to recover from failures and continue to function.

The goal of resiliency is to return the application to a fully\\nfunctioning state after a failure.\\n\\n\\nYour application is ready for \", \"the cloud when, at a minimum, it implements a software-based model of\\nresiliency, rather than a hardware-based model. Your cloud application must embrace the partial\\nfailures that will certainly occur. Design or partially refactor your application to achieve resiliency with\\nexpected partial failures. It should be designed to cope with partial failures, like transient network\\noutages and nodes, or VMs crashing in the cloud. Even containers being m\", \"oved to a different node\\nwithin an orchestrator cluster can cause intermittent short failures within the application.\\n\\n#### **Handling partial failure**\\n\\n\\nIn a cloud-based application, there\\u2019s an ever-present risk of partial failure. For instance, a single\\nwebsite instance or a container might fail, or it might be unavailable or unresponsive for a short time.\\nOr, a single VM or server might crash.\\n\\n\\nBecause clients and services are separate proce\", \"sses, a service might not be able to respond in a timely\\nmanner to a client\\u2019s request. The service might be overloaded and respond slowly to requests, or it\\nmight not be accessible for a short time because of network issues.\\n\\n\\nFor example, consider a monolithic .NET application that accesses a database in Azure SQL Database.\\nIf the Azure SQL database or any other third-party service is unresponsive for a brief time (an Azure\\nSQL database might be\", \" moved to a different node or server, and be unresponsive for a few seconds),\\nwhen the user tries to do any action, the application might crash and show an exception at the same\\nmoment.\\n\\n\\n29 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\\n\\n\\nA similar scenario might occur in an app that consumes HTTP services. The network or the service\\nitself might not be available in the cloud during a short, transient failure.\\n\\n\\nA resil\", \"ient application like the one shown in Figure 4-9 should implement techniques like \\u201cretries with\\nexponential backoff\\u201d to give the application an opportunity to handle transient failures in resources.\\nYou also should use \\u201ccircuit breakers\\u201d in your applications. A circuit breaker stops an application from\\ntrying to access a resource when it\\u2019s actually a long-term failure. By using a circuit breaker, the\\napplication avoids provoking a denial of serv\", \"ice to itself.\\n\\n\\n_Figure 4-9. Partial failures handled by retries with exponential backoff_\\n\\n\\nYou can use these techniques both in HTTP resources and in database resources. In Figure 4-9, the\\napplication is based on a 3-tier architecture, so you need these techniques at the services level (HTTP)\\nand at the data tier level (TCP). In a monolithic application that uses only a single app tier in addition\\nto the database (no additional services or mic\", \"roservices), handling transient failures at the database\\nconnection level might be enough. In that scenario, just a particular configuration of the database\\nconnection is required.\\n\\n\\nWhen implementing resilient communications that access the database, depending on the version of\\n[.NET you are using, it can be straightforward (for example, with Entity Framework 6 or later. It\\u2019s just a](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/ef6/fundamentals/connection-resi\", \"liency/retry-logic)\\nmatter of configuring the database connection). Or, you might need to use additional libraries like the\\n[Transient Fault Handling Application Block (for earlier versions of .NET), or even implement your own](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/msp-n-p/hh680934(v=pandp.50))\\nlibrary.\\n\\n\\nWhen implementing HTTP retries and circuit breakers, the recommendation for .NET is to use the\\n[Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Poll\", \"y) library, which targets .NET Standard 1.1 (coverage: .NET Core 1.0, Mono, Xamarin, UWP, WP8.1+)\\nand .NET Standard 2.0+ (coverage: .NET Core 2.0+, .NET Core 3.0 and later, Mono, Xamarin and UWP\\ntargets).

You can configure the apps so that they generate and use mock data, without using the\\nSQL database, for testing purposes. This optional config is based on dependency injection, in a\\ndecoupled way.\\n\\n#### **Scenario 1: ASP.NET Web apps**\\n\\n\\nThe figure below shows the simple scenario of \", \"the original legacy ASP.NET web applications.\\n\\n\\n39 CHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview\\n\\n\\nFrom a business domain perspective, both apps offer the same catalog management features.\\nMembers of the eShop enterprise team would use the app to view and edit the product catalog.\\n\\n\\nThe next figure shows the initial app screenshots.\\n\\n\\nDependencies in ASP.NET 4.x or earlier versions (either for MVC or for Web Forms) means that these\\n\", \"applications won\\u2019t run on .NET Core unless the code is fully rewritten by using ASP.NET Core MVC.\\n\\n#### **Scenario 2: WCF service and WinForms client app (3-Tier app)**\\n\\n\\nThe figure below shows the simple scenario of the original 3-Tier legacy application.\\n\\n\\n40 CHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview\\n\\n\\n#### **Benefits**\\n\\nThe benefits of this walkthrough are simple: Just get familiar with the code and initial apps.\\n\\n#### **Next\", \" steps**\\n\\n\\nExplore this content more in-depth on the GitHub wiki:\\n\\n\\n  - [Tour on the baseline ASP.NET MVC and Web Forms \\u201clegacy\\u201d apps](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/01.-Tour-on-the-ASP.NET-MVC-and-WebForms-apps-implementation-code)\\n\\n  - [Tour on the baseline WCF service and WinForms (3-Tier) \\u201clegacy\\u201d app](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/21.-Tour-on-the-WCF-service-and-WinForms-apps)\\n\\n###\", \" Walkthrough 2: Containerize your existing .NET applications with Windows Containers\\n\\n#### **Overview**\\n\\n\\nUse Windows Containers to improve deployment of existing .NET applications, like those based on\\nMVC, Web Forms, or WCF, to production, development, and test environments.\\n\\n#### **Goals**\\n\\n\\nThe goal of this walkthrough is to show you several options for containerizing an existing .NET\\nFramework application. You can:\\n\\n\\n  - [Containerize your ap\", \"plication by using Visual Studio 2022 Tools for Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/docker/visual-studio-tools-for-docker) (Visual Studio\\n2017 or later versions).\\n\\n\\n  - [Containerize your application by manually adding a Dockerfile, and then using the Docker CLI.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)\\n\\n\\n  - [Containerize your application by using the Img2Docker](https://github.com/docker/communitytools-imag\", \"e2docker-win) tool (an open-source tool from\\nDocker).\\n\\n\\n41 CHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview\\n\\n\\nThis walkthrough focuses on the Visual Studio 2022 Tools for Docker approach, but the other two\\napproaches are fairly similar in regard to using Dockerfiles.\\n\\n#### **Scenario 1: Containerized ASP.NET web apps**\\n\\n\\nFigure below shows the scenario for containerized eShop legacy web apps applications.\\n\\n#### **Scenario 2: Containeri\", \"zed WCF service**\\n\\n\\nFigure below shows the scenario for a 3-Tier app with a containerized WCF service.\\n\\n\\n42 CHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview\\n\\n\\n#### **Benefits**\\n\\nThere are advantages to running your monolithic application in a container. First, you create an image\\nfor the application. From that point on, every deployment runs in the same environment. Every\\ncontainer uses the same OS version, has the same version of depe\", \"ndencies installed, uses the same\\n.NET framework version, and is built by using the same process. Basically, you control the\\ndependencies of your application by using a Docker image. The dependencies travel with the\\napplication when you deploy the containers.\\n\\n\\nAn additional benefit is that developers can run the application in the consistent environment that\\u2019s\\nprovided by Windows Containers. Issues that appear only with certain versions can be s\", \"potted\\nimmediately, instead of surfacing in a staging or production environment. Differences in development\\nenvironments used by members of the development team matter less when applications run in\\ncontainers.\\n\\n\\nContainerized applications also have a flatter scale-out curve. Containerized apps enable you to have\\nmore application and service instances (based on containers) in a VM or physical machine compared\\nto regular application deployments per\", \" machine. This approach translates to higher density and fewer\\nrequired resources, especially when you use orchestrators like Kubernetes.\\n\\n\\nContainerization, in ideal situations, does not require making any changes to the application code\\n(C#). In most scenarios, you just need the Docker deployment metadata files (Dockerfiles and Docker\\nCompose files).\\n\\n#### **Next steps**\\n\\n\\nExplore this content more in-depth on the GitHub wiki:\\n\\n\\n  - [How to con\", \"tainerize the .NET Framework web apps with Windows Containers and Docker](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/02.-How-to-containerize-the-.NET-Framework-web-apps-with-Windows-Containers-and-Docker)\\n\\n  - [Adding Docker Support to a WCF service](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/22.-Adding-Docker-Support)\\n\\n\\n43 CHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview\\n\\n\\n### Walkthrough 3: Deploy \", \"your Windows Containers- based app to Azure VMs\\n\\n#### **Technical walkthrough availability**\\n\\nThe full technical walkthrough is available in the eShopModernizing GitHub repo wiki:\\n[https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/06.-Deploying-your-Windows-](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/06.-Deploying-your-Windows-Containers-based-app-into-Azure-VMs-(Including-CI-CD))\\n[Containers-based-app-into-Azure-VMs\", \"-(Including-CI-CD)](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/06.-Deploying-your-Windows-Containers-based-app-into-Azure-VMs-(Including-CI-CD))\\n\\n#### **Overview**\\n\\n\\nDeploying to a Docker host on a Windows Server 2016 Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure lets you quickly\\nset up development/test/staging environments.
