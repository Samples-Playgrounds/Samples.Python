    "Your application is ready for the cloud when, at a minimum, it implements a software-based model of resiliency, rather than a hardware-based model. Your cloud application must embrace the partial failures that will certainly occur. Design or partially refactor your application to achieve resiliency with expected partial failures. It should be designed to cope with partial failures, like transient network outages and nodes, or VMs crashing in the cloud. Even containers being moved to a different node within an orchestrator cluster can cause intermittent short failures within the application.",

    "Deploying to Azure App Service for Containers offers the benefits of containers paired with the PaaS benefits of Azure App Service. The app service can easily be scaled both vertically and horizontally, and can be configured to autoscale to meet changing demands. Updates can be performed with zero downtime and the configuration of continuous deployment from a registry is easily configured as well.",

    "Container-based solutions ultimately provide cost savings benefits. Containers are a solution to deployment problems because they remove the friction caused by an absence of dependencies in production environments. By removing those issues, it improves Dev/Test, DevOps, and production operations significantly.",
