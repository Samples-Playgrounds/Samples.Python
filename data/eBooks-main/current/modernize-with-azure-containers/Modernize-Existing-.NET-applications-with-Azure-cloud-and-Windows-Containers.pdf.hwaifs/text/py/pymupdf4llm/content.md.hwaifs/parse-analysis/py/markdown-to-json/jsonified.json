CloudNative applications usually require architecture and design that are created from scratch instead of by\nmodernizing existing applications. The key difference between a Cloud-Native application and a\nsimpler Cloud-Optimized web app is the recommendation to use microservices architectures in a\ncloud-native approach. Cloud-Optimized apps can also be monolithic web apps or N-Tier apps.\n\n[The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) (a collection of patterns that are closely related to microservices approaches)\nis also considered a requirement for cloud-native application architectures.\n\n[The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a primary promoter of cloud-native principles.](https://www.cncf.io/)\n[Microsoft is a member of the CNCF.](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-cncf/)\n\nFor detailed guidance on how to design and develop cloud-native applications, read the following\nfree e-books:\n\n17 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n\n['[Architecting Cloud-Native .NET Applications for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/introduction)', '[.NET Microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/)']\n\nThe most important factor to consider if you migrate a full application to the cloud-native model is\nthat you must rearchitect to a microservices-based architecture. This approach clearly requires a\nsignificant investment in development because of the large refactoring process involved. This option\nusually is chosen for mission-critical applications that need new levels of scalability and long-term\nagility. But, you could start moving toward cloud-native by adding microservices for just a few new\nscenarios, and eventually refactor the application fully as microservices. This step is an incremental\napproach that is the best option for some scenarios.", "**What about microservices?**": "Understanding microservices and how they work is important when you are considering cloud-native\napplications for your organization.\n\nThe microservices architecture is an advanced approach that you can use for applications that are\ncreated from scratch or when you evolve existing applications toward cloud-native applications. You\ncan start by adding a few microservices to existing applications to learn about the new microservices\nparadigms. But clearly, you need to architect and code, especially for this type of architectural\napproach.\n\nHowever, microservices are not mandatory for any new or modern application. Microservices are not a\n\u201cmagic bullet,\u201d and they aren\u2019t the single, best way to create every application. How and when you use\nmicroservices depends on the type of application that you need to build.\n\nThe microservices architecture is becoming the preferred approach for distributed and large or\ncomplex mission-critical applications that are based on multiple, independent subsystems in the form\nof autonomous services. In a microservices-based architecture, an application is built as a collection of\nservices that can be independently developed, tested, versioned, deployed, and scaled. This approach\ncan include any related, autonomous database per microservice.\n\nFor a detailed look at a microservices architecture that you can implement by using .NET, see the\n[downloadable PDF e-book .NET microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications. The](https://aka.ms/microservicesebook)\n[guide also is available online.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/)\n\nBut even in scenarios in which microservices offer powerful capabilities-independent deployment,\nstrong subsystem boundaries, and technology diversity-they also raise many new challenges. The\nchallenges are related to distributed application development, such as fragmented and independent\ndata models; achieving resilient communication between microservices; the need for eventual\nconsistency; and operational complexity. Microservices introduce a higher level of complexity\ncompared to traditional monolithic applications.\n\nBecause of the complexity of a microservices architecture, only specific scenarios and certain\napplication types are suitable for microservice-based applications. These include large and complex\napplications that have multiple, evolving subsystems. In these cases, it\u2019s worth investing in a more\ncomplex software architecture, for increased long-term agility and more efficient application\nmaintenance. But for less complex scenarios, it might be better to continue with a monolithic\napplication approach or simpler N-Tier approaches.\n\n18 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n\nAs a final note, even at the risk of being repetitive about this concept, you shouldn\u2019t look at using\nmicroservices in your applications as \u201call-in or nothing at all.\u201d You can extend and evolve existing\nmonolithic applications by adding new, small scenarios based on microservices. You don\u2019t need to\nstart from scratch to start working with a microservices architecture approach. In fact, we recommend\nthat you evolve from using an existing monolithic or N-Tier application by adding new scenarios.\nEventually, you can break down the application into autonomous components or microservices. You\ncan start evolving your monolithic applications in a microservices direction, step by step.\n\nIn any case, the rest of this present guidance focuses most of all on \u201cno microservices-based apps\u201d\nbecause this guidance is mainly targeting the modernization of existing apps that usually have\nmonolithic or N-Tier architectures."}, "Deploy existing .NET apps as Windows containers": {"**What are containers?

In its container, the\napplication is not affected by applications or processes that exist outside of the container. Everything\nthe application depends on to run successfully as a process is inside the container. Wherever the\ncontainer might move, the requirements of the application will always be met, in terms of direct\ndependencies, because it is bundled with everything that it needs to run (library dependencies,\nruntimes, and so on).\n\nThe main characteristic of a container is that it makes the environment the same across different\ndeployments because the container itself comes with all the dependencies it needs. You can debug\nthe application on your machine, and then deploy it to another machine, with the same environment\nguaranteed.\n\nA container is an instance of a container image. A container image is a way to package an app or\nservice (like a snapshot), and then deploy it in a reliable and reproducible way.

You might need to\nperform tasks like modifying configuration items, copying application content between servers, and\nrunning interactive setup programs based on .msi setups, followed by testing. All those steps in the\ndeployment add time and risk to deployments. You will get failures whenever a dependency is not\npresent in the target environment.\n\nIn Windows Containers, the process of packaging applications is fully automated. Windows Containers\nis based on the Docker platform, which offers automatic updates and rollbacks for container\ndeployments. The main improvement you get from using the Docker engine is that you create images,\nwhich are like snapshots of your application, with all its dependencies. The images are Docker images\n(a Windows container image, in this case). The images run ASP.NET apps in containers, without going\nback to source code. The container snapshot becomes the unit of deployment.\n\nMany organizations are containerizing existing monolithic applications for the following reasons:\n\n['**Release agility through improved deployment** .

A\ncontainer runs an operating system, has a file system, and can be accessed over a network, just like a\nphysical or virtual computer system. However, the technology and concepts behind containers are\nvastly different from virtual machines. From a developer point of view, a container must be treated\nmore like a single process. In fact, a container has a single entry point for one process.\n\nDocker containers (for simplicity, _containers_ ) can run natively on Linux and Windows. When running\nregular containers, Windows containers can run only on Windows hosts (a host server or a VM), and\nLinux containers can run only on Linux hosts. However, in recent versions of Windows Server and\nHyper-V containers, a Linux container can also run natively on Windows Server by using the Hyper-V\nisolation technology that currently is available only in Windows Server Containers.\n\nIn the near future, mixed environments that have both Linux and Windows containers will be possible\nand even common.", "**Benefits of Windows Containers for your existing .NET applications**": "The benefits of using Windows Containers are fundamentally the same benefits you get from\ncontainers in general.

Your only option is to use Docker\nimages based on Windows Server Core and the .NET Framework.\n\nWhen you add the image name to your Dockerfile file, you can select the operating system and\nversion by using a tag, as in the following examples for .NET Framework-based Windows container\nimages:\n\n22 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n\n|Tag|System and version|\n|---|---|\n|**mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/runti**<br>**me:4.x-windowsservercore-20H2**|.NET Framework 4.x on Windows Server Core|\n|**mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspne**<br>**t:4.x-windowsservercore-20H2**|.NET Framework 4.x with additional ASP.NET<br>customization, on Windows Server Core|\n\nFor .NET (cross-platform for Linux and Windows), the tags would look like the following:\n\n|Tag|System and version|\n|---|---|\n|**mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0**|.NET runtime-only on Linux|\n|**mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0-**<br>**nanoserver-ltsc2022**|.NET runtime-only on Windows Nano Server|\n\n**Multi-arch images**\n\n[Since 2017, Docker has had a feature called multi-arch](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15866) images. .NET Docker images can use multi-arch\ntags. Your Dockerfile files no longer need to define the operating system that you are targeting. The\nmulti-arch feature allows a single tag to be used across multiple machine configurations. For instance,\nwith multi-arch, you can use one common tag: **mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0** . If you pull\nthat tag from a Linux container environment, you get the Debian-based image. If you pull that tag\nfrom a Windows container environment, you get the Nano Server-based image.\n\nFor .NET Framework images, because the traditional .NET Framework supports only Windows, you\ncannot use the multi-arch feature.", "**Windows container types**": "Like Linux containers, Windows Server containers are managed by using Docker Engine. Unlike Linux\ncontainers, Windows containers include two different container types, or run times-Windows Server\ncontainers and Hyper-V isolation.\n\n**Windows Server containers** : Provides application isolation through process and namespace isolation\ntechnology. A Windows Server container shares a kernel with the container host and all containers\nthat are running on the host. These containers do not provide a hostile security boundary and should\nnot be used to isolate untrusted code. Because of the shared kernel space, these containers require\nthe same kernel version and configuration.\n\n**Hyper-V isolation** : Expands on the isolation provided by Windows Server Containers by running each\ncontainer on a highly optimized VM. In this configuration, the kernel of the container host is not\nshared with other containers on the same host. These containers are designed for hostile multitenant\nhosting, with the same security assurances of a VM. Because these containers don\u2019t share the kernel\nwith the host or other containers on the host, they can run kernels with different versions and\nconfigurations (with supported versions). For example, all Windows containers on Windows 10 use\nHyper-V isolation to utilize the Windows Server kernel version and configuration.\n\n23 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n\nRunning a container on Windows with or without Hyper-V isolation is a run-time decision. You might\nchoose to create the container with Hyper-V isolation initially, and at run time, choose to run it as a\nWindows Server container instead.\n\n**Additional resources**\n\n['**Windows Containers documentation**']\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/)\n\n['**Windows Containers fundamentals**']\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/)\n\n['**Infographic: Microsoft and containers**']\n\n[https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/Container%20infographic%201.4.17.pdf](https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/Container%20infographic%201.4.17.pdf)", "**The container ecosystem in Azure**": "In previous sections, it\u2019s been explained what the benefits of Docker containers are as well as details\non the specific container images for .NET applications.

With ACI, you\njust deploy the containers into a self-maintained environment and you just pay for those containers.\nYou don\u2019t need to maintain/update/patch VMs, so it is a much better platform for most scenarios\nwhere you might be using VMs with containers. Using ACI is straight forward, you just deploy a\ncontainer, there\u2019s no need to create a VM environment you just deploy containers.\n\nThe main benefits of Azure Container Instances (ACI) are:\n\n['Run containers without managing servers', 'Increase agility with containers on demand', 'Deploy containers to the cloud with unprecedented simplicity and speed\u2014with a single\\ncommand.']\n\n27 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n\n['Secure applications with hypervisor isolation']\n\nIn short, with ACI you can develop apps fast without managing virtual machines or having to learn\nnew tools.

You can use the best fit for your needs, however, it also surfaces questions about what\nproduct/technology you should use for your containerized applications.\n\nAs a _by-default_ recommendation, the following is the main criteria recommended in this guidance:\n\n['**Single monolithic app:** Choose Azure App Service', '**N-Tier app:** Choose orchestrators such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or App Service if\\nyou have a single or a few back-end services', '**Microservices:** Choose AKS or Azure Web Apps for Containers', '**Serverless functions & event handlers:** Choose Azure Functions', '**Large-scale Batch:** Choose Azure Batch']\n\n28 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n\nHowever, this recommendation should be taken with a pinch of salt, as the product\u2019s selection will\ndepend on your specific application\u2019s needs and characteristics.

For instance, a single\nwebsite instance or a container might fail, or it might be unavailable or unresponsive for a short time.\nOr, a single VM or server might crash.\n\nBecause clients and services are separate processes, a service might not be able to respond in a timely\nmanner to a client\u2019s request. The service might be overloaded and respond slowly to requests, or it\nmight not be accessible for a short time because of network issues.\n\nFor example, consider a monolithic .NET application that accesses a database in Azure SQL Database.\nIf the Azure SQL database or any other third-party service is unresponsive for a brief time (an Azure\nSQL database might be moved to a different node or server, and be unresponsive for a few seconds),\nwhen the user tries to do any action, the application might crash and show an exception at the same\nmoment.\n\n29 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n\nA similar scenario might occur in an app that consumes HTTP services. The network or the service\nitself might not be available in the cloud during a short, transient failure.\n\nA resilient application like the one shown in Figure 4-9 should implement techniques like \u201cretries with\nexponential backoff\u201d to give the application an opportunity to handle transient failures in resources.\nYou also should use \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d in your applications. A circuit breaker stops an application from\ntrying to access a resource when it\u2019s actually a long-term failure. By using a circuit breaker, the\napplication avoids provoking a denial of service to itself.\n\n_Figure 4-9. Partial failures handled by retries with exponential backoff_\n\nYou can use these techniques both in HTTP resources and in database resources. In Figure 4-9, the\napplication is based on a 3-tier architecture, so you need these techniques at the services level (HTTP)\nand at the data tier level (TCP). In a monolithic application that uses only a single app tier in addition\nto the database (no additional services or microservices), handling transient failures at the database\nconnection level might be enough. In that scenario, just a particular configuration of the database\nconnection is required.\n\nWhen implementing resilient communications that access the database, depending on the version of\n[.NET you are using, it can be straightforward (for example, with Entity Framework 6 or later. It\u2019s just a](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/ef6/fundamentals/connection-resiliency/retry-logic)\nmatter of configuring the database connection). Or, you might need to use additional libraries like the\n[Transient Fault Handling Application Block (for earlier versions of .NET), or even implement your own](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/msp-n-p/hh680934(v=pandp.50))\nlibrary.\n\nWhen implementing HTTP retries and circuit breakers, the recommendation for .NET is to use the\n[Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) library, which targets .NET Standard 1.1 (coverage: .NET Core 1.0, Mono, Xamarin, UWP, WP8.1+)\nand .NET Standard 2.0+ (coverage: .NET Core 2.0+, .NET Core 3.0 and later, Mono, Xamarin and UWP\ntargets).

First, you create an image\nfor the application. From that point on, every deployment runs in the same environment. Every\ncontainer uses the same OS version, has the same version of dependencies installed, uses the same\n.NET framework version, and is built by using the same process. Basically, you control the\ndependencies of your application by using a Docker image. The dependencies travel with the\napplication when you deploy the containers.\n\nAn additional benefit is that developers can run the application in the consistent environment that\u2019s\nprovided by Windows Containers. Issues that appear only with certain versions can be spotted\nimmediately, instead of surfacing in a staging or production environment. Differences in development\nenvironments used by members of the development team matter less when applications run in\ncontainers.\n\nContainerized applications also have a flatter scale-out curve. Containerized apps enable you to have\nmore application and service instances (based on containers) in a VM or physical machine compared\nto regular application deployments per machine. This approach translates to higher density and fewer\nrequired resources, especially when you use orchestrators like Kubernetes.\n\nContainerization, in ideal situations, does not require making any changes to the application code\n(C#).
