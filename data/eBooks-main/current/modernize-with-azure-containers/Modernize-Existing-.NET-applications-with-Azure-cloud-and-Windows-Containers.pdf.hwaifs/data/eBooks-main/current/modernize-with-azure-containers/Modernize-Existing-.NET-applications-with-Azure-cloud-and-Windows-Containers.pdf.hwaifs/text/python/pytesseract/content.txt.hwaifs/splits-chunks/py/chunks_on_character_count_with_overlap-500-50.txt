Rearchitecting an application by using an\nadvanced approach like microservices isn’t always an option because of cost and time restraints.\nDepending on the type of application, re", "architecting an app also might not be necessary. To optimize\nthe cost-effectiveness of your organization's cloud migration strategy, it’s important to consider the\nneeds of your business and the requirements of your apps. You'll need to determine:\n\n° Which apps require a transformation or rearchitecting.\n. Which apps need to be only partially modernized.\n\n. Which apps you can “lift and shift” directly to the cloud.\nmE Microsoft\n\nAbout this guide\n", "\nThis guide focuses primarily on the initial modernization of existing Microsoft .NET Framework web or\nservice-oriented applications, meaning the action of moving a workload to a newer or more modern\nenvironment without significantly altering the application's code and basic architecture.\n\nThis guide also highlights the benefits of moving your apps to the cloud and partially modernizing\napps by using a specific set of new technologies and approac", 'hes, like Windows Containers and\nrelated compute-platforms in Azure supporting Windows Containers.\n\nPath to the cloud for existing .NET applications\n\nOrganizations typically choose to move to the cloud for the agility and speed they can get for their\napplications. You can set up thousands of servers (VMs) in the cloud in minutes, compared to the\nweeks it typically takes to set up on-premises servers.\n\nThere isn’t a single, one-size-fits-all strat', "egy for migrating applications to the cloud. The right\nmigration strategy for you will depend on your organization's needs and priorities, and the kind of\napplications you are migrating. Not all applications warrant the investment of moving to a platform as\na service (PaaS) model or developing a cloud-native application model. In many cases, you can take a\nphased or incremental approach to invest in moving your assets to the cloud, based on your ", 'business\nneeds.\n\nFor modern applications with the best long-term agility and value for the organization, you might\nbenefit from investing in cloud-native application architectures. However, for applications that are\nexisting or legacy assets, the key is to spend minimal time and money (no rearchitecting or code\nchanges) while moving them to the cloud, to realize significant benefits.\n\nFigure 1-1 shows the possible paths you can take when you move', ' existing .NET applications to the\ncloud in incremental phases.\nmE Microsoft\n\nThe Journey to the Cloud\n\nMigrate Modernize\nContainerize\n+ cloud managed services\n\nExisting Cloud Cloud\napps & services Rehost_ Fiiernatedtce Optimized\nNET Framework Ready apps\non-premises apps\n\nCloud-Native\napps\n\nRearchitect/Rebuild\n\nCO\n\nneal =o a\nOn-Premises laaS Containers Microservices Architecture\nInfrastructure Platform “Lift & shift" & PaaS & Serverless\nNo code c', "hanges Minimal code changes Architected for the cloud\n\nmodernized/rewrite\n\nFigure 1-1. Modernization paths for existing .NET applications and services\n\nEach migration approach has different benefits and reasons for using it. You can choose a single\napproach when you migrate apps to the cloud, or choose certain components from multiple\napproaches. Individual applications aren't limited to a single approach or maturity state. For instance,\na common", ' hybrid approach would have certain on-premises components plus other components in\nthe cloud.\n\nThe definition and short explanation for each application maturity level are the following:\n\nLevel 1: Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications: In this migration approach, you just migrate or\nrehost your current on-premises applications to an infrastructure as a service (laaS) platform. Your\napps have almost the same composition as before, but now you d', 'eploy them to VMs in the cloud.\nThis simple type of migration is typically known in the industry as “Lift & Shift.”\n\nLevel 2: Cloud Optimized applications: At this level and still without rearchitecting or altering\nsignificant code, you can gain additional benefits from running your app in the cloud with modern\ntechnologies like containers and additional cloud-managed services. You improve the agility of your\napplications to ship faster by refini', 'ng your enterprise development operations (DevOps) processes.\nYou achieve this functionality by using technologies like Windows Containers, which is based on\nDocker Engine. Containers remove the friction that’s caused by application dependencies when you\ndeploy in multiple stages. In this maturity model, you can deploy containers on laaS or PaaS while\nusing additional cloud-managed services related to databases, cache as a service, monitoring, an', 'd\ncontinuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.\n\nThe third level of maturity is the ultimate goal in the cloud, but it’s optional for many apps and not the\nmain focus of this guide:\nm= Microsoft\n\nLevel 3: Cloud-Native applications: This migration approach typically is driven by business need and\ntargets modernizing your mission-critical applications. At this level, you use PaaS services to move\nyour apps to PaaS computing platfo', 'rms. You implement cloud-native applications and microservices\narchitecture to evolve applications with long-term agility, and to scale to new limits. This type of\nmodernization usually requires architecting specifically for the cloud. New code often must be written,\nespecially when you move to cloud-native application and microservice-based models. This approach\ncan help you gain benefits that are difficult to achieve in your monolithic and on-p', 'remises application\nenvironment.\n\nTable 1-1 describes the main benefits of and reasons for choosing each migration or modernization\napproach.\n\nCloud-Native\nModernize, rearchitect, and\nrewrite\n\nApplications deployed to VMs__| Monolithic or N-Tier apps Containerized microservices on\n\nin Azure deployed to Azure App Service, | Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\nAzure Container Instance (ACI), | and/or serverless microservices\nVMs with containers, or AKS ', 'based on Azure Functions.\n(Azure Kubernetes Service)\n\nSQL or any relational database | Azure SQL Database Managed _ | Fined-grain databases per\nonaVM Instance or another managed microservice, based on Azure\ndatabase in the cloud.

Benefits and challenges of modernization paths for existing .NET applications and services\n\nCloud Infrastructure-Ready Cloud-Optimize', 'd\nLift and shift Modernize\n\nKey technologies and architectures by maturity level\n\n.NET Framework applications initially started with .NET Framework version 1.0, which was released in\nlate 2001. Then, companies moved towards newer versions (such as 2.0, 3.5 and .NET Framework 4.x).\nMost of those applications ran on Windows Server and Internet Information Server (IIS), and used a\nrelational database, like SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or any other RDB', 'MS.\n\nMost existing .NET applications might nowadays be based on .NET Framework 4.x, or even on .NET\nFramework 3.5, and use web frameworks like ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET Web API,\nWindows Communication Foundation (WCF), ASP.NET SignalR, and ASP.NET Web Pages. These\nestablished .NET Framework technologies depend on Windows. That dependency is important to\nmE Microsoft\n\nconsider if you are simply migrating legacy apps and you want to ma', 'ke minimal changes to your\napplication infrastructure.\n\nFigure 1-2 shows the primary technologies and architecture styles used at each of the three cloud\nmaturity levels:\n\nMaturity model for NET applications modernization Microsoft\n\nExisting apps Cloud Cloud-Optimized Cloud-Native\n.NET web apps (on-premises) Infrastructure-Ready PaaS PaaS for microservices and serverless\n\nMicroservices and serverless architectures\n\nMonolithic or N-Tier Monolithic', ' or N-Tier Monolithic or N-Tier\n\narchitectures architectures architectures\n\nNet Pe NET\nal al\nP laaS M d servi —\n“Relational: (Infrastructure as a Service) oe rT\nDatabase a\n\n» EH Rees\n\nPaaS for containerized microservices\n\nx : a“ ee + Serverless computing\nEp Windows Containers + Managed services\nOn-premises TAN TAN Nw\nAzure Azure Azure\n\nBase Cloud Environment and cross-cutting concerns: Network, Hybrid-cloud, Identity/Auth, Cost control and Operat', 'ions model\n\nMigrate / Rehost\n\nModernize\n\nMinimal code changes Architected for the cloud, needs new code\n\nFigure 1-2. Primary technologies for each maturity level for modernizing existing .NET web applications\n\nFigure 1-2 highlights the most common scenarios, but many hybrid and mixed variations are possible\nwhen it comes to architecture. For example, the maturity models apply not only to monolithic\narchitectures in existing web apps, but also to ', 'service orientation, N-Tier, and other architecture style\nvariations. The higher focus or percentage on one or another architecture type and related\ntechnologies determines the overall maturity level of your applications.\n\nEach maturity level in the modernization process is associated with the following key technologies and\napproaches:\n\n. Cloud Infrastructure-Ready (rehost or basic lift & shift): As a first step, many organizations\nwant only to q', 'uickly execute a cloud-migration strategy. In this case, applications are\nrehosted. Most rehosting can be automated by using Azure Migrate, a service that provides\nthe guidance, insights, and mechanisms needed to assist you in migrating to Azure based on\ncloud tools like Azure Site Recovery and Azure Database Migration Service. You can also set\nup rehosting manually, so that you can learn infrastructure details about your assets when\nyou move leg', 'acy apps to the cloud. For example, you can move your applications to VMs in\nAzure with little modification-probably with only minor configuration changes. The\nnetworking in this case is similar to an on-premises environment, especially if you create\nvirtual networks in Azure.\n\n. Cloud-Optimized (Managed Services and Windows Containers): This model is about making\na few important deployment optimizations to gain some significant benefits from the', " cloud,\nmE Microsoft\n\nwithout changing the core architecture of the application. The fundamental step here is to\nadd Windows Containers support to your existing .NET Framework applications. This\nimportant step (containerization) doesn't require touching the code, so the overall lift and\nshift effort is light. You can use tools like Image2Docker or Visual Studio, with its tools for\nDocker. Visual Studio automatically chooses smart defaults for ASP", '.NET applications and\nWindows Containers images. These tools offer both a rapid inner loop, and a fast path to get\nthe containers to Azure. Your agility is improved when you deploy to multiple environments.\nThen, moving to production, you can deploy your Windows Containers to Azure Web App for\nContainers, Azure Container Instances (ACI), and Azure VMs with Windows Server 2016 and\ncontainers if you prefer an laaS approach. For more complex multi-c', 'ontainer applications,\n\nconsider using orchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS/ACS).\n\nDuring this initial modernization, you can also add assets from the cloud, such as monitoring with\ntools like Azure Application Insights; CI/CD pipelines for your app lifecycles with Azure DevOps\nServices; and many more data resource services that are available in Azure. For instance, you can\nmodify a monolithic web app that was originally developed by ', 'using traditional ASP.NET Web Forms\nor ASP.NET MVC, but now you deploy it by using Windows Containers. When you use Windows\nContainers, you should also migrate your data to a database in Azure SQL Database Managed\nInstance, all without changing the core architecture of your application.\n\n° Cloud-Native: As introduced, you should think about architecting cloud-native applications\nwhen you are targeting large and complex applications with multiple ', 'independent\ndevelopment teams working on different microservices that can be developed and deployed\nautonomously. Also, due to granularized and independent scalability per microservice. These\narchitectural approaches face very important challenges and complexities but can be greatly\nsimplified by using cloud PaaS and orchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS/ACS)\n(managed Kubernetes), and Azure Functions for a serverless approach. All thes', 'e approaches\n(like microservices and Serverless) typically require you to architect for the cloud and write\nnew code—code that is adapted to specific PaaS platforms, or code that aligns with specific\narchitectures, like microservices.\n\nFigure 1-3 shows the internal technologies that you can use for each maturity level:\nm= Microsoft\n\neL Existing TAN Cloud w Cloud-Optimized w Cloud-Native\n\n.NET applications (on-prem.)

The\ncontent in the first few chapters of the guide is designed for architects and technical decision makers\nwho want an overview, but who don\'t need to focus on implementation and technical, step-by-step\ndetails.\n\nThe last chapter of ', 'this guide introduces multiple walkthroughs that focus on specific deployment\nscenarios. This guide offers shorter versions of the walkthroughs, to summarize the scenarios and\nhighlight their benefits. The full walkthroughs drill down into setup and implementation details, and\nare published as a set of wiki posts in the same public GitHub repo where related sample apps reside\n(discussed in the next section).

.NET\napps to Azure laaS (Cloud\nIntrastructure-Ready\n\nVision: As a first step, to reduce your on-premises investment and total cost of hardware and\nnetworking maintenance, simply rehost your existing applications in the cloud.\n\nBefore get', "ting into how to migrate your existing applications to the Azure infrastructure as a service\n(laaS) platform, it's important to analyze the reasons why you'd want to migrate directly to laaS in\nAzure. The scenario at this modernization maturity level essentially is to start using VMs in the cloud,\ninstead of continuing to use your current, on-premises infrastructure.\n\nAnother point to analyze is why you might want to migrate to pure laaS cloud in", 'stead of just adding\nmore advanced managed services in Azure. Determine what cases might require laaS in the first place.\n\nFigure 2-1 positions Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications in the modernization maturity levels:\n\nExisting .NET application modernization: Maturity models\n\nExisting apps Cloud Cloud-Optimized Cloud-Native\n.NET web apps (on-premises) Infrastructure-Ready Containerized & Managed Microservice architecture\nMonolithic architectu', 're Monolithic & N-Tier Monolithic & N-Tier Microservices architectures\nOn-premises Azure Azure\n\nMinimal code changes Architected for the cloud, needs new code\n\nFigure 2-17. Positioning Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications\n\n1 CHAPTER 1 | Lift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure laaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready)\nWhy migrate existing .NET web applications to\nAzure laaS\n\nThe main reason to migrate to the cloud, even at an initial laaS level, is ', 'to achieve cost reductions. By\nusing more managed infrastructure services, your organization can lower its investment in hardware\nmaintenance, server or VM provisioning and deployment, and infrastructure management.\n\nAfter you make the decision to move your apps to the cloud, the main reason why you might choose\nlaaS instead of more advanced options like PaaS is simply that the laaS environment will be more\nfamiliar. Moving to an environment that', "'s similar to your current, on-premises environment offers a\nlower learning curve, which makes it the quickest path to the cloud.\n\nHowever, taking the quickest path to the cloud doesn’t mean that you will gain the most benefit from\nhaving your applications running in the cloud. Any organization will gain the most significant benefits\nfrom a cloud migration at the already introduced Cloud-Optimized and Cloud-Native maturity levels.\n\nIt also has be", 'come evident that applications are easier to modernize and rearchitect in the future\nwhen they are already running in the cloud, even on laaS. Application data migration has already been\nachieved. Also, your organization will have gained the skills required for working in the cloud and\nmade the shift to operating in a “cloud culture.”\n\nWhen to migrate to laaS instead of to PaaS\n\nThe next sections discuss Cloud-Optimized applications that are most', 'ly based on PaaS platforms and\nservices. These apps give you the most benefits from migrating to the cloud.\n\nIf your goal is simply to move existing applications to the cloud, first, identify existing applications that\nwould not require substantial modification to run in Azure App Service. These apps should be the first\ncandidates for Cloud-Optimized.\n\nThen, for the apps that still cannot move to Windows Containers and PaaS such as App Service or', '\norchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service, migrate those apps to simple plain VMs (laaS).\n\nBut, keep in mind that correctly configuring, securing, and maintaining VMs requires much more time\nand IT expertise compared to using PaaS services in Azure. If you are considering Azure Virtual\nMachines, make sure that you take into account the ongoing maintenance effort required to patch,\nupdate, and manage your VM environment. Azure Virtual Machines ', "Is laaS.\n\nUse Azure Migrate to analyze and migrate your\nexisting applications to Azure\n\nMigrating to the cloud doesn't have to be difficult. But many organizations struggle to get started - to\nget deep visibility into the environment and the tight interdependencies between applications,\nworkloads, and data. Without that visibility, it can be difficult to plan the path forward. Without\ndetailed information on what's required for a successful migra", "tion, you can't have the right\n\n2 CHAPTER 1 | Lift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure laaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready)\nconversations within your organization. You don’t know enough about the potential cost benefits, or\nwhether workloads could just lift-and-shift or would require significant rework to migrate successfully.\nNo wonder many organizations hesitate.\n\nAzure Migrate is a new service that provides the guidance, insights, and mechanism", 's needed to assist\nyou in migrating to Azure. Azure Migrate provides:\n\n° Discovery and assessment for on-premises virtual machines\n. Inbuilt dependency mapping for high-confidence discovery of multi-tier applications\n° Intelligent right sizing to Azure virtual machines\n\n. Compatibility reporting with guidelines for remediating potential issues\n. Integration with Azure Database Management Service for database discovery and migration\n\nAzure Migrate', ' gives you confidence that your workloads can migrate with minimal impact to the\nbusiness and run as expected in Azure. With the right tools and guidance, you can achieve maximum\nreturn on investment while assuring that critical performance and reliability needs are met.\n\nFigure 2-2 shows you the built-in dependency mapping for all server and application connections\nperformed by Azure Migrate.\n\n( =) @ Dependencies-Microx X + Vv = Fe x\n\n— 7 0 @ |6', ' xy ¢e he\n\nchine(s)\n\nLegend ©. ®\n\nFigure 2-2. Positioning Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications\n\nUse Azure Site Recovery to migrate your existing\nVMs to Azure VMs\n\nAs part of the end-to-end Azure Migrate, Azure Site Recovery Is a tool that you can use to easily\nmigrate your web apps to VMs in Azure. You can use Site Recovery to replicate on-premises VMs and\nphysical servers to Azure, or to replicate them to a secondary on-premises location. You', ' can even\nreplicate a workload that’s running on a supported Azure VM, on an on-premises Hyper-V VM, on a\nVMware VM, or on a Windows or Linux physical server. Replication to Azure eliminates the cost and\ncomplexity of maintaining a secondary datacenter.\n\n3 CHAPTER 1 | Lift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure laaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready)\nSite Recovery is also made specifically for hybrid environments that are partly on-premises and partly\no', "n Azure. Site Recovery helps ensure business continuity by keeping your apps that are running on\nVMs and on-premises physical servers available if a site goes down. It replicates workloads that are\nrunning on VMs and physical servers so that they remain available in a secondary location if the\nprimary site isn't available. It recovers workloads to the primary site when it's up and running again.\n\nFigure 2-3 shows the execution of multiple VM migr", 'ations by using Azure Site Recovery.\n\nReplicated items\n\nre) Refresh + Replicate 35 Columns\n\nLast refreshed at: 10/13/2016, 2:59:17 PM\n\ni) Finished loading data from service.\n\nFilter items\nNAME HEALTH STATUS ACTIVE LOCATION REPLICATION POLICY\n\nyer2012 v .

If you are migrating SQL Server dat', "abases and need nearly 100%\nassurance that you won't need to rearchitect your application or make changes to your data or data\naccess code, choose the Managed Instance feature of Azure SQL Database.\n\nAzure SQL Database Managed Instance is the best option if you have additional requirements for SQL\nServer instance-level functionality, or isolation requirements beyond the features provided in a\nstandard Azure SQL Database (single database model). T", 'his last one is the most PaaS-oriented choice,\nbut it doesn’t offer the same features as that of a traditional SQL server. Migration might surface\nfrictions.\n\nFor example, an organization that has made deep investments in instance-level SQL Server capabilities\nwould benefit from migrating to SQL Managed Instance. Examples of instance-level SQL Server\ncapabilities include SQL common language runtime (CLR) integration, SQL Server Agent, and cross-\n', 'database querying. Support for these features is not available in standard Azure SQL Database (a\nsingle-database model).\n\nAn organization that operates in a highly regulated industry, and which needs to maintain isolation for\nsecurity purposes, also might benefit from choosing the SQL Managed Instance model.\n\nManaged Instance in Azure SQL Database has the following characteristics:\n\n. Security isolation through Azure Virtual Network\n. Application', ' surface compatibility, with these features:\n- SQL Server Agent and SQL Server Profiler\n\n- Cross-database references and queries, SQL CLR, replication, change data capture\n(CDC), and Service Broker\n\n° Database sizes up to 35 TB\n\n° Minimum-downtime migration, with these features:\n— Azure Database Migration Service\n- Native backup and restore, and log shipping\n\nWith these capabilities, when you migrate existing application databases to Azure SQL Da', "tabase, the\nManaged Instance model offers nearly 100% of the benefits of PaaS for SQL Server. Managed Instance\nis a SQL Server environment where you continue using instance-level capabilities without changing\nyour application design.\n\nManaged Instance is probably the best fit for enterprises that currently are using SQL Server, and\nwhich require flexibility in their network security in the cloud. It's like having a private virtual network\nfor you", 'r SQL databases.\n\n7 CHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure\nWhen to migrate to Azure SQL Database\n\nAs mentioned, the standard Azure SQL Database is a fully managed, relational DBaaS. SQL Database\ncurrently manages millions of production databases, across 38 datacenters, around the world. It\nsupports a broad range of applications and workloads, from managing straightforward transactional\ndata, to driving the most data-intensive, mis', 'sion-critical applications that require advanced data\nprocessing at a global scale.\n\nBecause of its full PaaS features, better pricing-and ultimately lower cost-you should move to the\nstandard Azure SQL Database as your “by-default choice” if you have an application that uses basic,\nstandard SQL databases, and no additional instance features. SQL Server features like SQL CLR\nintegration, SQL Server Agent, and cross-database querying are not suppo', "rted in the standard Azure\nSQL Database. Those features are available only in the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance model.\n\nAzure SQL Database is the only intelligent cloud database service that's built for app developers. It's\nalso the only cloud database service that scales on-the-fly, without downtime, to help you efficiently\ndeliver multitenant apps. Ultimately, Azure SQL Database leaves you more time to innovate, and it\naccelerates your ti", 'me to market. You can build secure apps and connect to your SQL database by\nusing the languages and platforms that you prefer.\n\nAzure SQL Database offers the following benefits:\n. Built-in intelligence (machine learning) that learns and adapts to your app\n° On-demand database provisioning\n° A range of offers, for all workloads\n. 99.99% availability SLA, zero maintenance\n. Geo-replication and restore services for data protection\n. Azure SQL Databa', "se Point in Time Restore feature\n° Compatibility with SQL Server 2016, including hybrid and migration\n\nThe standard Azure SQL Database is closer to PaaS than Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.\nPrefer the standard Azure SQL Database because you'll get more benefits from a managed cloud.\nHowever, Azure SQL Database has some key differences from regular and on-premises SQL Server\ninstances. Depending on your existing application’s database require", 'ments, and your enterprise\nrequirements and policies, it might not be the best choice when you are planning your migration to\nthe cloud.\n\nWhen to move your original RDBMS to a VM (laaS)\n\nOne of your migration options is to move your original relational database management system\n(RDBMS), including Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, to a similar server that’s\nrunning on an Azure VM. If you have existing applications that require th', "e fastest migration to the\ncloud with minimal changes, or no changes at all, a direct migration to laaS in the cloud might be a\n\n8 CHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure\nfair option. It might not be the best way to take advantage of all the cloud’s benefits, but it's probably\nthe fastest initial path.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft Azure supports up to 331 different database servers deployed as laaS VMs. These\ninclude popular RDBMS like SQ", 'L Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM DB2, and many other\nNoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, DataStax, MariaDB, and Cloudera.\n\nNote\n\nAlthough moving your RDBMS to an Azure VM might be the fastest way to migrate your data to the\ncloud (because it is laaS), this approach requires a significant investment in your IT teams (database\n\nadministrators and IT pros). Enterprise teams need to be able to set up and manage high availability,\ndis', 'aster recovery, and patching for SQL Server. This context also needs a customized environment,\nwith full administrative rights.\n\nWhen to migrate to SQL Server as a VM (laaS)\n\nThere might be a few cases where you still need to migrate to SQL Server as a regular VM. An\nexample scenario is if you need to use SQL Server Reporting Services. In most cases, though, Azure\nSQL Database Managed Instance can provide everything you need to migrate from on-pr', 'emises SQL\nservers, SO migration to a SQL Server VM should be your last resort to try.\n\nUse Azure Database Migration Service to migrate\nyour relational databases to Azure\n\nYou can use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate relational databases like SQL Server, and\nMySQL to Azure, whether your target database is Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Database Managed\nInstance, or SQL Server on an Azure VM.\n\nThe automated workflow, with assessment repo', 'rting, guides you through the changes you need to\nmake before you migrate the database. When you are ready, the service migrates the source database\nto Azure.\n\nWhenever you change an original RDBMS, you might need to retest. You also might need to change\nthe SQL sentences or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) code in your application, depending on\ntesting results.\n\nIf you have any other database (for example, IBM DB2) and you opt for a lift and shif', "t approach, you\nmight want to continue using those databases as laaS VMs in Azure, unless you are willing to perform\na more complex data migration. A more complex data migration will require additional effort because\nyou'd be migrating to a different database type with the new schema and different programming\nlibraries.\n\n9 CHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure\nAdditional resources\n\n° Choose a cloud SQL Server option: Azure SQL Da", 'tabase (PaaS) or SQL Server on Azure\nVM (laaS)\n\n.

You might be failing or not reaching your full potential because you can't\nsync app delivery with the needs of the market.\n\nThe need for continuous business innovation pushes development and operations teams to the limit.\nThe only way to achieve the agility you ne", 'ed in continuous business innovation is by modernizing\nyour applications with technologies like containers and specific Cloud-Optimized application\nprinciples.\n\nThe bottom line is that when an organization builds and manages applications that are Cloud-\nOptimized, it can put solutions in the hands of customers sooner and bring new ideas to market when\nthey are relevant.\n\nCloud-Optimized application principles and tenets\n\nImprovements in the cloud', ' are mostly focused on meeting two goals: Reduce costs and improve\nbusiness growth by improving agility. These goals are achieved by simplifying processes and reducing\nfriction when you release and ship applications.\n\nYour application is Cloud-Optimized if you can-in an agile manner-develop your app autonomously\nfrom other on-premises apps, and then release, deploy, autoscale, monitor, and troubleshoot your\napp in the cloud.\n\nThe key is agility. ', "You can't ship with agility unless you reduce to an absolute minimum any\ndeployment-to-production issues and dev/test environment issues. Containers (specifically, Docker, as\na de facto standard) and managed services were designed specifically for this purpose.\n\nTo achieve agility, you also need automated DevOps processes that are based on CI/CD pipelines that\nrelease to scalable platforms in the cloud. CI/CD platforms (like Azure DevOps Services", ' or Jenkins) that\ndeploy to a scalable and resilient cloud platform (like Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service)\nare key technologies for achieving agility in the cloud.\n\nThe following list describes the main tenets or practices for Cloud-Optimized applications. Note that\nyou can adopt all or only some of these principles, in a progressive or incremental approach:\n\n° Containers. Containers give you the ability to include application depen', 'dencies with the\napplication itself. Containerization significantly reduces the number of issues you might\nencounter when you deploy to production environments or test in staging environments.\nUltimately, containers improve the agility of application delivery.\n\n12 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n. Resilient and scalable cloud. The cloud provides a platform that is managed, elastic,\nscalable, and resilient.', " These characteristics are fundamental to gain cost improvements and\nship highly available and reliable applications in a continuous delivery. Managed services like\nmanaged databases, managed cache as a service (CaaS), and managed storage are\nfundamental pieces in alleviating the maintenance costs of your application.\n\n. Monitoring. You can't have a reliable application without having a good way to detect and\ndiagnose exceptions and application p", 'erformance issues. You need to get actionable insights\nthrough application performance management and instant analytics.\n\n. DevOps culture and continuous delivery. Adopting DevOps practices requires a cultural\nchange in which teams no longer work in independent silos. CI/CD pipelines are possible only\nwhen there Is an increased collaboration between development and IT operations teams,\nsupported by containers and CI/CD tools.\n\nFigure 4-2 shows th', 'e main optional pillars of a Cloud-Optimized application. The more pillars you\nimplement, the readier your application will be to succeed in meeting your customers’ expectations.\n\nCloud-Optimized application\n\nContainerized\nResilient & high available cloud\n\nMonitored/Insights\n\nDevOps and continuous delivery\n\nFigure 4-2. Main pillars of a Cloud-Optimized application\n\nTo summarize, a Cloud-Optimized application is an approach to building and managin', "g applications\nthat takes advantage of the cloud computing model, while using a combination of containers,\nmanaged cloud infrastructure, resilient application techniques, monitoring, continuous delivery, and\nDevOps, all without the need to rearchitect and recode your existing applications.\n\nYour organization can adopt these technologies and approaches gradually. You don't have to\nembrace all of them, all at once. You can adopt them incrementally,", ' depending on enterprise priorities\nand user needs.\n\n13 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nBenefits of a Cloud-Optimized application\n\nYou can get the following benefits by converting an existing application to a Cloud-Optimized\n\napplication (without rearchitecting or coding):\n\nLower costs, because the managed infrastructure is handled by the cloud provider.\nCloud-Optimized applications get the benefits of the', ' cloud by using the cloud’s out-of-the-\nbox elasticity, autoscale, and high availability. Benefits are related not only to the compute\nfeatures (VMs and containers), but also depend on the resources in the cloud, like DBaaS,\nCaaS, and any infrastructure an application might needed.\n\nResilient application and infrastructure. When you migrate to the cloud, you need to\nembrace transient failures; failures will occur in the cloud. Also, cloud infrast', 'ructure and\nhardware are “replaceable,” which increases opportunities for transient downtime. At the\nsame time, inner cloud capabilities and certain application development techniques that\nimplement resiliency and automate recovery make it much easier to recover from unexpected\nfailures in the cloud.\n\nDeeper insights into application performance. Cloud monitoring tools like Azure\nApplication Insights provide visualization for health management, l', 'ogging, and notifications.\nAudit logs make applications easy to debug and audit, fundamental for a reliable cloud\napplication.\n\nApplication portability, with agile deployments. Containers (either Linux or Windows\ncontainers based on Docker Engine) offer the best solution to avoiding a cloud-locked\napplication. By using containers, Docker hosts, and multi-cloud orchestrators, you can easily\nmove from one environment or cloud to another. Containers', ' eliminate the friction that\ntypically occurs in deployments to any environment (stage/test/production).\n\nAll of these benefits ultimately provide key cost reductions for your end-to-end application lifecycle.\n\nIn the following sections, these benefits are explained in more detail, and are linked to specific\ntechnologies.\n\nMicrosoft technologies in cloud-optimized\napplications\n\nThe following list describes the tools, technologies, and solutions t', 'hat are recognized as requirements\nfor Cloud-Optimized apps. You can adopt Cloud-Optimized elements selectively or gradually,\ndepending on your priorities.\n\n14\n\nCloud infrastructure: The infrastructure that provides the compute platform, operating\nsystem, network, and storage. Microsoft Azure is positioned at this level.\n\nRuntime: This layer provides the environment for the application to run. If you are using\ncontainers, this layer usually is ba', 'sed on Docker Engine, running either on Linux hosts or on\nWindows hosts. (Windows Containers are supported beginning with Windows Server 2016.\n\nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nWindows Containers is the best choice for existing .NET Framework applications that run on\nWindows.)\n\n. Managed cloud: When you choose a managed cloud option, you can avoid the expense and\ncomplexity of managing and supporting the un', 'derlying infrastructure, VMs, OS patches, and\nnetworking configuration. If you choose to migrate by using laaS, you are responsible for all\nof these tasks, and for associated costs. In a managed cloud option, you manage only the\napplications and services that you develop. The cloud service provider typically manages\neverything else. Examples of managed cloud services in Azure include Azure SQL Database,\nAzure Redis Cache, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure S', 'torage, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure\n\nDatabase for PostgreSQL, Azure Active Directory, and managed compute services like VM\nscale sets, Azure App Service, and Azure Kubernetes Service.\n\n. Application development: You can choose from many languages when you build\napplications that run in containers. This guide focuses on .NET, but, you can develop\ncontainer-based apps by using other languages, like Node.js, Python, Spring/Java, or Go.\n\n° Monito', 'ring, telemetry, logging, and auditing: The ability to monitor and audit applications\nand containers that are running in the cloud is critical for any Cloud-Optimized application.\n\nAzure Application Insights and Microsoft Operations Management Suite are the main\nMicrosoft tools that provide monitoring and auditing for Cloud-Optimized apps.\n\n. Provisioning: Automation tools help you provision the infrastructure and deploy an\napplication to multipl', "e environments (production, testing, staging). You can use tools like\nChef and Puppet to manage an application's configuration and environment. This layer also\ncan be implemented by using simpler and more direct approaches. For example, you can\ndeploy directly by using Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) tooling, and then use the\ncontinuous deployment and release management pipelines in Azure DevOps Services.\n\n. Application lifecycle: Azure ", 'DevOps Services and other tools, like Jenkins, are built\nautomation servers that help you implement CI/CD pipelines, including release management.\n\nThe next sections of this chapter, and the related walkthroughs, focus specifically on details about the\nruntime layer (Windows Containers). The guidance describes the ways you can deploy Windows\nContainers on Windows Server 2016 (and later versions) VMs and Azure Container Instances. It also\ncovers m', "ore advanced PaaS platforms like Azure App Service and orchestrator like Azure Kubernetes\nService.\n\nMonolithic applications can be Cloud-Optimized\n\nIt's important to highlight that monolithic applications (applications that are not based on\nmicroservices) can be Cloud-Optimized applications. You can build and operate monolithic\napplications that take advantage of the cloud computing model by using a combination of containers,\ncontinuous delivery,", ' and DevOps. If an existing monolithic application is right for your business goals,\nyou can modernize it and make it Cloud-Optimized.\n\nSimilarly, if monolithic applications can be Cloud-Optimized applications, other, more complex\narchitectures like N-Tier applications can also be modernized as Cloud-Optimized applications.\n\n15 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nWhat about Cloud-Native applications?\n\nAlthough', " Cloud-Native applications are not the main focus of this guide, it's helpful to have an\nunderstanding of this modernization maturity level, and to distinguish it from Cloud-Optimized\napplications.\n\nFigure 4-3 positions Cloud-Native apps in the application modernization maturity levels:\n\nExisting .NET application modernization: Maturity models\n\nExisting apps Cloud Cloud-Optimized Cloud-Native\n.NET web apps (on-premises) Infrastructure-Ready Conta", 'inerized & Managed Microservice architecture\n\nMonolithic & N-Tier\n\nMonolithic & N-Tier\n\nMonolithic architecture Microservices architectures\n\nap yh rh\n\nOn-premises Azure Azure\n\nMinimal code changes Architected for the cloud, needs new code\n\nFigure 4-3. Positioning Cloud-Native applications\n\nThe Cloud-Native modernization maturity level usually requires new development investments.\nMoving to the Cloud-Native level typically is driven by business ne', 'ed to modernize applications as\nmuch as possible to drastically improve scale in large applications by creating autonomous\nsubsystems (microservices) that can be deployed and scale independently from other areas of the\napplication while lowering costs in the long term and increase evolution agility of those autonomous\napp’s parts that provide significant compete advantages.\n\nThe main pillars of Cloud-Native applications are based on microservices', ' architecture approaches,\nwhich can evolve with agility and scale to limits that would be difficult to achieve in a monolithic\narchitecture, deployed to either on-premises or cloud environment.\n\nFigure 4-4 shows the main characteristics of the Cloud-Native model.\n\n16 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nCloud-Native in Azure\nMain characteristics\n\nIAN\n\nCloud-native\nMicroservices\nDocker containers\nOrchestrators (', 'AKS/Kubernetes, Service Fabric)\n\nServerless (Azure Functions)\nCloud-resilient\n\n.NET Core (cross-platform, Linux/Windows)\nOther languages\n\nFigure 4-4. Cloud-Native characteristics\n\nIn addition, you can extend basic modern web apps and cloud-native apps by adding other services,\nlike artificial intelligence (Al), machine learning (ML), and loT. You might use any of these services to\nextend any of the possible Cloud-Optimized approaches.\n\nThe fundam', 'ental difference in applications at the Cloud-Native level is in the application architecture.\nCloud-native applications are, by definition, apps that are based on microservices. Cloud-native apps\nrequire special architectures, technologies, and platforms, compared to a monolithic web application\nor traditional N-Tier application.\n\nCloud-native applications details\n\nCloud-Native is a more advanced or mature state for large and mission-critical ap', 'plications. Cloud-\nNative applications usually require architecture and design that are created from scratch instead of by\nmodernizing existing applications. The key difference between a Cloud-Native application and a\nsimpler Cloud-Optimized web app is the recommendation to use microservices architectures in a\ncloud-native approach. Cloud-Optimized apps can also be monolithic web apps or N-Tier apps.\n\nThe Twelve-Factor App (a collection of patter', 'ns that are closely related to microservices approaches)\nis also considered a requirement for cloud-native application architectures.\n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a primary promoter of cloud-native principles.\nMicrosoft is a member of the CNCF.\n\nFor detailed guidance on how to design and develop cloud-native applications, read the following\nfree e-books:\n\n17 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applicati', 'ons\n° Architecting Cloud-Native .NET Applications for Azure\n° .NET Microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications.\n\nThe most important factor to consider if you migrate a full application to the cloud-native model is\nthat you must rearchitect to a microservices-based architecture. This approach clearly requires a\nsignificant investment in development because of the large refactoring process involved. This option\nusually is chosen', ' for mission-critical applications that need new levels of scalability and long-term\nagility. But, you could start moving toward cloud-native by adding microservices for just a few new\nscenarios, and eventually refactor the application fully as microservices. This step is an incremental\napproach that is the best option for some scenarios.\n\nWhat about microservices?\n\nUnderstanding microservices and how they work is important when you are consideri', 'ng cloud-native\napplications for your organization.\n\nThe microservices architecture is an advanced approach that you can use for applications that are\ncreated from scratch or when you evolve existing applications toward cloud-native applications. You\ncan start by adding a few microservices to existing applications to learn about the new microservices\nparadigms. But clearly, you need to architect and code, especially for this type of architectural', "\napproach.\n\nHowever, microservices are not mandatory for any new or modern application. Microservices are not a\n“magic bullet,” and they aren't the single, best way to create every application. How and when you use\nmicroservices depends on the type of application that you need to build.\n\nThe microservices architecture is becoming the preferred approach for distributed and large or\ncomplex mission-critical applications that are based on multiple, ", 'independent subsystems in the form\nof autonomous services. In a microservices-based architecture, an application is built as a collection of\nservices that can be independently developed, tested, versioned, deployed, and scaled. This approach\ncan include any related, autonomous database per microservice.\n\nFor a detailed look at a microservices architecture that you can implement by using .NET, see the\n\ndownloadable PDF e-book .NET microservices: A', 'rchitecture for containerized .NET applications. The\nguide also is available online.\n\nBut even in scenarios in which microservices offer powerful capabilities-independent deployment,\nstrong subsystem boundaries, and technology diversity-they also raise many new challenges. The\nchallenges are related to distributed application development, such as fragmented and independent\ndata models; achieving resilient communication between microservices; the ', "need for eventual\nconsistency; and operational complexity. Microservices introduce a higher level of complexity\ncompared to traditional monolithic applications.\n\nBecause of the complexity of a microservices architecture, only specific scenarios and certain\napplication types are suitable for microservice-based applications. These include large and complex\napplications that have multiple, evolving subsystems. In these cases, it's worth investing in", " a more\ncomplex software architecture, for increased long-term agility and more efficient application\nmaintenance. But for less complex scenarios, it might be better to continue with a monolithic\napplication approach or simpler N-Tier approaches.\n\n18 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nAs a final note, even at the risk of being repetitive about this concept, you shouldn't look at using\nmicroservices in your ap", "plications as “all-in or nothing at all.” You can extend and evolve existing\nmonolithic applications by adding new, small scenarios based on microservices. You don't need to\nstart from scratch to start working with a microservices architecture approach. In fact, we recommend\nthat you evolve from using an existing monolithic or N-Tier application by adding new scenarios.\nEventually, you can break down the application into autonomous components or ", 'microservices. You\ncan start evolving your monolithic applications in a microservices direction, step by step.\n\nIn any case, the rest of this present guidance focuses most of all on “no microservices-based apps”\nbecause this guidance Is mainly targeting the modernization of existing apps that usually have\nmonolithic or N-Tier architectures.\n\nDeploy existing .NET apps as Windows containers\n\nDeployments that are based on Windows Containers are appl', "icable to Cloud-Optimized applications\nand Cloud-Native applications.\n\nHowever, in this guide and especially in the following sections, it mostly focuses on using Windows\nContainers for Cloud-Optimized applications where you don't need to rearchitect your application.\n\nWhat are containers? (Linux or Windows)\n\nContainers are a way to wrap up an application into its own isolated package. In its container, the\napplication is not affected by applicat", 'ions or processes that exist outside of the container. Everything\nthe application depends on to run successfully as a process is inside the container. Wherever the\ncontainer might move, the requirements of the application will always be met, in terms of direct\ndependencies, because it is bundled with everything that it needs to run (library dependencies,\nruntimes, and so on).\n\nThe main characteristic of a container is that it makes the environmen', 't the same across different\ndeployments because the container itself comes with all the dependencies it needs. You can debug\nthe application on your machine, and then deploy it to another machine, with the same environment\nguaranteed.\n\nA container is an instance of a container image. A container image is a way to package an app or\nservice (like a snapshot), and then deploy it in a reliable and reproducible way. You could say that\nDocker is not on', 'ly a technology-it’s also a philosophy and a process.\n\nAs containers daily become more common, they are becoming an industry-wide “unit of deployment."\n\nBenefits of containers (Docker Engine on Linux or Windows)\n\nBuilding applications by using containers-which also might be defined as lightweight building blocks-\noffers a significant increase in agility for building, shipping, and running any application, across any\ninfrastructure.\n\nWith containe', "rs, you can take any app from development to production with little or no code change,\nthanks to Docker integration across Microsoft developer tools, operating systems, and the cloud.\n\n19 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nWhen you deploy to plain VMs, you probably already have a method in place for deploying ASP.NET\napps to your VMs. It's likely, though, that your method involves multiple manual steps or com", 'plex\nautomated processes by using a deployment tool like Puppet, or a similar tool. You might need to\nperform tasks like modifying configuration items, copying application content between servers, and\nrunning interactive setup programs based on .msi setups, followed by testing. All those steps in the\ndeployment add time and risk to deployments. You will get failures whenever a dependency is not\npresent in the target environment.\n\nIn Windows Conta', 'iners, the process of packaging applications Is fully automated. Windows Containers\nis based on the Docker platform, which offers automatic updates and rollbacks for container\ndeployments. The main improvement you get from using the Docker engine is that you create images,\nwhich are like snapshots of your application, with all its dependencies. The images are Docker images\n(a Windows container image, in this case). The images run ASP.NET apps in ', "containers, without going\nback to source code. The container snapshot becomes the unit of deployment.\n\nMany organizations are containerizing existing monolithic applications for the following reasons:\n\n. Release agility through improved deployment. Containers offer a consistent deployment\ncontract between development and operations. When you use containers, you won't hear\ndevelopers say, “It works on my machine, why not in production?” They can s", 'ay, “It runs as a\ncontainer, so it will run in production.” The packaged application, with all its dependencies,\ncan be executed in any supported container-based environment. It will run the way it was\nintended to run in all deployment targets (dev, QA, staging, production). Containers eliminate\nmost frictions when they move from one stage to the next, which greatly improves\ndeployment, and you can ship faster.\n\n. Cost reductions. Containers lead', ' to lower costs, either by the consolidation and removal of\nexisting hardware, or from running applications at a higher density per unit of hardware.\n\n° Portability. Containers are modular and portable. Docker containers are supported on any\nserver operating system (Linux and Windows), in any major public cloud (Microsoft Azure,\nAmazon AWS, Google, IBM), and in on-premises and private or hybrid cloud environments.\n\n. Control. Containers offer a f', "lexible and secure environment that's controlled at the container\nlevel. A container can be secured, isolated, and even limited by setting execution constraint\npolicies on the container. As detailed in the section about Windows Containers, Windows\nServer 2016 and Hyper-V containers offer additional enterprise support options.\n\nSignificant improvements in agility, portability, and control ultimately lead to significant cost\nreductions when you use", ' containers to develop and maintain applications.\n\nWhat is Docker?\n\nDocker is an Open-source project that automates the deployment of applications as portable, self-\nsufficient containers that can run in the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a company that\npromotes and evolves this technology. The company works in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and\nWindows vendors, including Microsoft.\n\n20 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Op', 'timized applications\nRun anywhere\n\nWindows Server\nContainer\n\nFigure 4-6. Docker deploys containers at all layers of the hybrid cloud\n\nTo someone familiar with virtual machines, containers might appear to be remarkably similar. A\ncontainer runs an operating system, has a file system, and can be accessed over a network, just like a\nphysical or virtual computer system. However, the technology and concepts behind containers are\nvastly different from ', 'virtual machines. From a developer point of view, a container must be treated\nmore like a single process. In fact, a container has a single entry point for one process.\n\nDocker containers (for simplicity, containers) can run natively on Linux and Windows. When running\nregular containers, Windows containers can run only on Windows hosts (a host server or a VM), and\nLinux containers can run only on Linux hosts. However, in recent versions of Window', 's Server and\nHyper-V containers, a Linux container can also run natively on Windows Server by using the Hyper-V\nisolation technology that currently is available only in Windows Server Containers.\n\nIn the near future, mixed environments that have both Linux and Windows containers will be possible\nand even common.\n\nBenefits of Windows Containers for your existing .NET applications\n\nThe benefits of using Windows Containers are fundamentally the same', ' benefits you get from\ncontainers in general. Using Windows Containers is about greatly improving agility, portability, and\ncontrol.\n\nExisting .NET applications refer to those applications that were created using the .NET Framework. For\nexample, they might be traditional ASP.NET web applications-they don’t use .NET Core or .NET 5+,\nwhich is newer and runs cross-platform on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.\n\nThe main dependency in the .NET Framework is W', "indows. It also has secondary dependencies, like IIS,\nand System.Web in traditional ASP.NET.\n\nA .NET Framework application must run on Windows, period. If you want to containerize existing .NET\nFramework applications and you can’t or don’t want to invest in a migration to .NET Core or later(“If it\n\n21 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nworks properly, don't migrate it”), the only choice you have for container", 's is to use Windows\nContainers.\n\nSo, one of the main benefits of Windows Containers is that they offer you a way to modernize your\nexisting .NET Framework applications that are running on Windows-through containerization.\nUltimately, Windows Containers gets you the benefits that you are looking for by using containers-\nagility, portability, and better control.\n\nChoose an OS to target with .NET-based containers\n\nGiven the diversity of operating sy', 'stems that are supported by Docker, as well as the differences\nbetween .NET Framework and .NET Core, you should target a specific OS and specific versions based\non the framework you are using.\n\nFor Windows, you can use Windows Server Core or Windows Nano Server. These Windows versions\nprovide different characteristics (like IIS versus a self-hosted web server like Kestrel) that might be\nneeded by .NET Framework or .NET applications.\n\nFor Linux, m', 'ultiple distros are available and supported in official .NET Docker images (like Debian).\n\nFigure 4-7 shows OS versions that you can target, depending on the app’s version of the .NET\nFramework.\n\nWhat OS to target with .NET containers\n\nCompatible with\n\nExisting ‘NET Framework Windows existing apps\nIIS\n\n-NET\n\napps 3.5, 4.x Server Core\n\nLarger Image\n\nCloud Optimized,\nWindows Container OS\nKestrel\n\nNano Server Smaller, Faster Start\nTime\n\nDebian, Alpi', 'ne, etc.\nKestrel\n\nSmaller, Faster Start\nTime\n\nFigure 4-7. Operating systems to target based on .NET Framework version\n\nIn migration scenarios for existing or legacy applications that are based on .NET Framework\napplications, the main dependencies are on Windows and IIS. Your only option is to use Docker\nimages based on Windows Server Core and the .NET Framework.\n\nWhen you add the image name to your Dockerfile file, you can select the operating sy', 'stem and\nversion by using a tag, as in the following examples for .NET Framework-based Windows container\nimages:\n\n22 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/runti .NET Framework 4.x on Windows Server Core\nme:4.x-windowsservercore-20H2\n\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspne | .NET Framework 4.x with additional ASP.NET\nt:4.x-windowsservercore-20H2 customization, on Windows Serve', 'r Core\n\nFor .NET (cross-platform for Linux and Windows), the tags would look like the following:\n\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0 .NET runtime-only on Linux\n\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0- .NET runtime-only on Windows Nano Server\nnanoserver-Itsc2022\n\nMulti-arch images\n\nSince 2017, Docker has had a feature called multi-arch images. .NET Docker images can use multi-arch\ntags. Your Dockerfile files no longer need to define the operating ', 'system that you are targeting. The\nmulti-arch feature allows a single tag to be used across multiple machine configurations. For instance,\nwith multi-arch, you can use one common tag: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0. If you pull\nthat tag from a Linux container environment, you get the Debian-based image. If you pull that tag\nfrom a Windows container environment, you get the Nano Server-based image.\n\nFor .NET Framework images, because the tra', 'ditional .NET Framework supports only Windows, you\ncannot use the multi-arch feature.\n\nWindows container types\n\nLike Linux containers, Windows Server containers are managed by using Docker Engine. Unlike Linux\ncontainers, Windows containers include two different container types, or run times-Windows Server\ncontainers and Hyper-V isolation.\n\nWindows Server containers: Provides application isolation through process and namespace isolation\ntechnolog', 'y. A Windows Server container shares a kernel with the container host and all containers\nthat are running on the host. These containers do not provide a hostile security boundary and should\nnot be used to isolate untrusted code. Because of the shared kernel space, these containers require\nthe same kernel version and configuration.\n\nHyper-V isolation: Expands on the isolation provided by Windows Server Containers by running each\ncontainer on a hig', 'hly optimized VM. In this configuration, the kernel of the container host is not\nshared with other containers on the same host. These containers are designed for hostile multitenant\nhosting, with the same security assurances of a VM. Because these containers don’t share the kernel\nwith the host or other containers on the host, they can run kernels with different versions and\nconfigurations (with supported versions). For example, all Windows conta', 'iners on Windows 10 use\nHyper-V isolation to utilize the Windows Server kernel version and configuration.\n\n23 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nRunning a container on Windows with or without Hyper-V isolation is a run-time decision. You might\nchoose to create the container with Hyper-V isolation initially, and at run time, choose to run it as a\nWindows Server container instead.\n\nAdditional resources\n\n° Windo', "ws Containers documentation\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/\n\n° Windows Containers fundamentals\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/\n\n° Infographic: Microsoft and containers\n\nhttps://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/Container%20infographic%201.4.17.pdf\n\nThe container ecosystem in Azure\n\nIn previous sections, it's been explained what the benefits of Docker containers are as well", ' as details\non the specific container images for .NET applications.

Azure App Service\n° Azure Kubernetes Serv', 'ice (AKS and ACS)\n° Azure Batch\n\nThen, Azure Container Registry is a high scalable container registry hosted in Azure that you can use\nfrom all the previous products when registering and deploying your custom container images.\n\nIn addition, from your containers, you can consume other managed services in Azure like Azure SQL\nDatabase, Azure Redis cache, Azure Cosmos DB, etc. plus there are third-party solutions/platforms\n\n25 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize ', "existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\navailable in Azure Marketplace like Cloud Foundry and OpenShift where you can also use containers\nwithin Azure.\n\nIn the next sections, you can explore Microsoft's recommendations on when to use each of those\nAzure products and solutions specifically when targeting Windows Containers.\n\nWhen not to deploy to Windows Containers\n\nSome Windows technologies are not supported by Windows Containers. In t", 'hose cases, you still need\nto migrate to the standards VMs, usually with just Windows and IIS.\n\nFor more information, see the list of Applications not supported by Windows containers.\n\nAdditional resources\n\n° Virtual machines and containers in Azure\n\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/overview/containers/\n\nWhen to deploy Windows Containers in your on-\npremises laaS VM infrastructure\n\n. Your organization might not be ready to move to the cloud, or it mig', 'ht not be able to move\nto the cloud for a business reason. But, you can still get the benefits of using Windows\nContainers in your own datacenters.\n\n. You might have other artifacts that are being used on-premises, and which might slow you\ndown when you try to move to the cloud. For example, security or authentication\ndependencies with on-premises Windows Server Active Directory, or any other on-premises\nasset.\n\n. If you start using Windows Conta', 'iners today, you can make a phased migration to the cloud\ntomorrow from a much better position. Windows Containers is becoming a unit of\ndeployment for any cloud, with no lock-in.\n\nWhen to deploy Windows Containers to Azure VMs\n(laaS cloud)\n\nIf your organization Is using Azure VMs, even if you are also using Windows Containers, you are still\ndealing with laaS. That means that dealing with infrastructure operations, VM OS patches, and\ninfrastructu', 're complexity for highly scalable applications when you need to deploy to multiple VMs in\na load-balanced infrastructure. The main scenarios for using Windows Containers in an Azure VM are:\n\n° Dev/test environment: A VM in the cloud is perfect for development and testing in the\ncloud. You can rapidly create or stop the environment depending on your needs.\n\n26 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n. Small and med', 'ium scalability needs: In scenarios where you might need just a couple of\nVMs for your production environment, managing a few VMs might be affordable until you\ncan move to more advanced PaaS environments, like orchestrators.\n\n. Production environment with existing deployment tools: You might be moving from an\non-premises environment in which you have invested in tools to make complex deployments\nto VMs or bare-metal servers (like Puppet or simila', "r tools). To move to the cloud with minimal\nchanges to production environment deployment procedures, you might continue to use\nthose tools to deploy to Azure VMs. However, you'll want to use Windows Containers as the\nunit of deployment to improve the deployment experience.\n\nWhen to deploy Windows Containers to Azure\nContainer Instances (ACI)\n\nThe main value proposition of Azure Container Instances is that you can right away deploy containers\nto i", "t and you don't need to maintain that environment, you don’t need to upgrade/patch the\nunderlying operating system or VMs, all that is transparent and you just deploy containers into a\nready-to-use environment.\n\nThe reasons and scenarios when you would want to use ACI are similar to the main scenarios when\nyou use Azure VMs with containers, so basically, the main scenarios for using Azure Container\nInstances are:\n\n. Dev/Test scenarios\n\n° Task aut", "omation\n\n° CI/CD agents\n\n° Small/scale batch processing\n\n. Simple web apps\n\nThe simple web apps scenario is a fair scenario for ACI but take into account that since in ACI you can\nonly have a single container instance per container image, you won't have high availability and only\nhave limited scalability.\n\nHowever, even when ACI is considered infrastructure because it just provides single container\ninstances, there is a huge benefit compared to r", "egular Azure VMs with Windows Server. With ACI, you\njust deploy the containers into a self-maintained environment and you just pay for those containers.\nYou don't need to maintain/update/patch VMs, so it is a much better platform for most scenarios\nwhere you might be using VMs with containers. Using ACI is straight forward, you just deploy a\ncontainer, there's no need to create a VM environment you just deploy containers.\n\nThe main benefits of Az", 'ure Container Instances (ACI) are:\n\n. Run containers without managing servers\n\n° Increase agility with containers on demand\n\n. Deploy containers to the cloud with unprecedented simplicity and soeed—with a single\ncommand.\n\n27 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\n° Secure applications with hypervisor isolation\n\nIn short, with ACI you can develop apps fast without managing virtual machines or having to learn\nnew t', 'ools. It’s just your application, in a container, running in the cloud.\n\nWhen to deploy Windows Containers to Azure\nKubernetes Service (AKS)\n\nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by\noffloading the operational overhead to Azure. You get an open solution that offers portability both for\nyour containers and for your application configuration. You select the size, the number of hosts, and\nthe orche', 'strator tools. Azure Kubernetes Service handles the infrastructure for you. It also supports\nWindows Server containers alongside Linux containers. For more details on Windows OS support and\nthe feature differences between Windows and Linux, read the FAQ.\n\nThe main benefits of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) are:\n\n. Identity and security management\n\n. Integrated logging and monitoring\n\n° Cluster node and pod scaling.\n\n° Ingress with HTTP applicatio', "n routing\n\n. AKS supports the Docker image format. For private storage of your Docker images, you can\nintegrate AKS with Azure Container Registry (ACR).\n\nIf you are already working with open-source orchestrators like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or DC/OS,\nyou don't need to change your existing management practices to move container workloads to the\ncloud. Use the application management tools that you're already familiar with and connect via the\nstan", 'dard API endpoints for the orchestrator of your choice.\n\nChoosing Azure compute platforms for container-\nbased applications\n\nAs you have noticed after reading the previous sections, Azure is an open cloud that offers multiple\nchoices. You can use the best fit for your needs, however, it also surfaces questions about what\nproduct/technology you should use for your containerized applications.\n\nAs a by-default recommendation, the following is the ma', 'in criteria recommended in this guidance:\n\n. Single monolithic app: Choose Azure App Service\n\n. N-Tier app: Choose orchestrators such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or App Service if\nyou have a single or a few back-end services\n\n. Microservices: Choose AKS or Azure Web Apps for Containers\n° Serverless functions & event handlers: Choose Azure Functions\n\n° Large-scale Batch: Choose Azure Batch\n\n28 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Clou', "d-Optimized applications\nHowever, this recommendation should be taken with a pinch of salt, as the product's selection will\ndepend on your specific application's needs and characteristics. Not all applications are the same even\nwhen initially they might look similar types.\n\nAfter a deeper analysis of the application's needs, the product selected could be different. But, as a\nStarting point, it is good to have initial guidance from where you can s", 'tart evaluating and testing\nbased on certain priority.\n\nAdditional resources\n\n° Choose an Azure compute service for your application\n\nBuild resilient services ready for the cloud: Embrace\ntransient failures in the cloud\n\nResiliency is the ability to recover from failures and continue to function. Resiliency is not about\navoiding failures, but accepting the fact that failures will occur, and then responding to them in a way\nthat avoids downtime or', ' data loss. The goal of resiliency is to return the application to a fully\nfunctioning state after a failure.\n\nYour application is ready for the cloud when, at a minimum, it implements a software-based model of\nresiliency, rather than a hardware-based model. Your cloud application must embrace the partial\nfailures that will certainly occur. Design or partially refactor your application to achieve resiliency with\nexpected partial failures. It shou', 'ld be designed to cope with partial failures, like transient network\noutages and nodes, or VMs crashing in the cloud. Even containers being moved to a different node\nwithin an orchestrator cluster can cause intermittent short failures within the application.\n\nHandling partial failure\n\nIn a cloud-based application, there’s an ever-present risk of partial failure. For instance, a single\nwebsite instance or a container might fail, or it might be una', "vailable or unresponsive for a short time.\nOr, a single VM or server might crash.\n\nBecause clients and services are separate processes, a service might not be able to respond in a timely\nmanner to a client's request. The service might be overloaded and respond slowly to requests, or it\nmight not be accessible for a short time because of network issues.\n\nFor example, consider a monolithic .NET application that accesses a database in Azure SQL Data", 'base.\nIf the Azure SQL database or any other third-party service is unresponsive for a brief time (an Azure\nSQL database might be moved to a different node or server, and be unresponsive for a few seconds),\nwhen the user tries to do any action, the application might crash and show an exception at the same\nmoment.\n\n29 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nA similar scenario might occur in an app that consumes HTT', 'P services. The network or the service\nitself might not be available in the cloud during a short, transient failure.\n\nA resilient application like the one shown in Figure 4-9 should implement techniques like “retries with\nexponential backoff” to give the application an opportunity to handle transient failures in resources.\nYou also should use “circuit breakers” in your applications. A circuit breaker stops an application from\ntrying to access a r', "esource when it's actually a long-term failure. By using a circuit breaker, the\napplication avoids provoking a denial of service to itself.\n\nResilient communication in cloud applications\n\nASP.NET app (MVC or WebForms) on ASP.NET Web API or WCF on SQL database\nWindows Server Core Container Windows Server Core Container\n\nHTTP\nP|\nASPNET app aay\nHTTP retries TCP retries\nwith exponential backoff with exponential backoff\nand Circuit Breaker and Circuit", ' Breaker\n\nFigure 4-9. Partial failures handled by retries with exponential backoff\n\nYou can use these techniques both in HTTP resources and in database resources. In Figure 4-9, the\napplication is based on a 3-tier architecture, so you need these techniques at the services level (HTTP)\nand at the data tier level (TCP). In a monolithic application that uses only a single app tier in addition\nto the database (no additional services or microservices', "), handling transient failures at the database\nconnection level might be enough. In that scenario, just a particular configuration of the database\nconnection Is required.\n\nWhen implementing resilient communications that access the database, depending on the version of\n.NET you are using, it can be straightforward (for example, with Entity Framework 6 or later. It's just a\nmatter of configuring the database connection). Or, you might need to use a", 'dditional libraries like the\nTransient Fault Handling Application Block (for earlier versions of .NET), or even implement your own\nlibrary.\n\nWhen implementing HTTP retries and circuit breakers, the recommendation for .NET is to use the\nPolly library, which targets .NET Standard 1.1 (coverage: .NET Core 1.0, Mono, Xamarin, UWP, WP8.1 +)\nand .NET Standard 2.0+ (coverage: .NET Core 2.0+, .NET Core 3.0 and later, Mono, Xamarin and UWP\ntargets). The n', 'uget package also includes direct targets for .NET Framework 4.6.1 and 4.7.2.\n\nTo learn how to implement strategies for handling partial failures in the cloud, see the following\nreferences.\n\nAdditional resources\n\n° Implementing resilient communication to handle partial failure\n\n30 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\napplications/partial-failure-strategies\n\n° Entity Framework connection resiliency and retry log', 'ic (version 6 and later)\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/et/ef6/fundamentals/connection-resiliency/retry-logic\n° The Transient Fault Handling Application Block\n\n° https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/msp-n-p/hh680934(v=pandp.50\n\n° Polly library for resilient HTTP communication\n\nhttps://github.com/App-vNext/Polly\n\nModernize your apps with monitoring and telemetry\n\nWhen you run an application in production, it’s critical that you have insights', ' about how your\napplication is performing. Is it performing at a high level? Are users getting errors, or is the application\nstable and reliable? You need rich performance monitoring, powerful alerting, and dashboards to help\nensure that your application is available and performing as expected. You also need to be able to see\nquickly if there’s a problem, determine how many customers are affected, and perform a root-cause\nanalysis to find and fix', ' the issue.\n\nMonitor your application with Application Insights\n\nApplication Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for web\ndevelopers who work on multiple platforms. Use it to monitor your live web application. Application\nInsights automatically detects performance anomalies.

With the right DevOps tools, developers can streamline continuous\ndeployment and get innovative applicati', 'ons into the hands of users more quickly.\n\nAlthough continuous integration and deployment practices are well established, the introduction of\ncontainers introduces new considerations, particularly when you are working with multi-container\napplications.\n\nAzure DevOps Services supports continuous integration and deployment of multi-container\napplications to various environments through the official Azure DevOps Services deployment tasks:\n\n° Deploy ', 'to an Azure Web App for Containers\n\n° Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service\n\nBut you can also deploy to Docker Swarm or DC/OS by using Azure DevOps Services script-based\ntasks.\n\n34 CHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications\nTo continue facilitating deployment agility, these tools provide excellent dev-to-test-to-production\ndeployment experiences for container workloads, with a choice of development and CI/CD solutions.\n', '\nFigure 4-12 shows a continuous deployment pipeline that deploys to a Kubernetes cluster in Azure\nContainer Service.\n\nBuilds Releases Library Task Groups Deployment Groups*\n\nAll definitions > eShopModernizingMVC-Kubernetes-PROD-ENV\n\nPipeline Tasks ~ Variables Retention Options — History\n\nPROD eShopModernizing Kubernetes\n\neplaymnent proc Deploy to Kubernetes © * Remove\nVersion o* v\n\nAgent phase +\n\n& Run en agent\nDisplay name *\n\non Deploy SQL conta', 'iner\n\nDeploy to Kubemetes Deploy MVC app container\nS Deploy MVC app container @ 3 Kubernetes Service Connection @ | Manage 2\ntes =\n\nDeploy to Kubemet\n\nPROD Kubernetes Conn Prod Environment v () + New\nS Refresh MVC pod\n\nDeploy to Kubemetes\n\nContainer Registry Details ~\n\nContainer Registry type * @\n\nContainer Registry v\n\nDocker Registry Connection @ | Manage\n\ncesard|@DockerHub v ro) + New\n\nFigure 4-12.

However, it’s likely\nthat any organization might benefit from having some of their applications in the public cloud and\nother applications on-premises. But a mixed environment can lead to ex", 'cessive complexity in\nenvironments due to different platforms and technologies used in public clouds versus on-premises\nenvironments.\n\nMicrosoft provides the best hybrid cloud solution, one in which you can optimize your existing assets\non-premises and in the public cloud, while you ensure consistency in an Azure hybrid cloud. You can\nmaximize existing skills, and get a flexible, unified approach to building apps that can run in the cloud\nor on-p', 'remises, thanks to Azure Stack (on-premises) and Azure (public cloud).\n\nWhen it comes to security, you can centralize management and security across your hybrid cloud. You\ncan get control over all assets, from your datacenter to the cloud, by providing single sign-on to on-\npremises and cloud apps. You accomplish this functionality by extending Active Directory to a hybrid\ncloud, and by using identity management.\n\nFinally, you can distribute and ', "analyze data seamlessly, use the same query languages for cloud and\non-premises assets, and apply analytics and deep learning in Azure to enrich your data, regardless of\nits source.\n\nAzure Stack\n\nAzure Stack is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you deliver Azure services from your organization's\ndatacenter.

First, you create an image\nfor the application. From that point on, every deployment runs i', 'n the same environment. Every\ncontainer uses the same OS version, has the same version of dependencies installed, uses the same\n.NET framework version, and is built by using the same process. Basically, you control the\ndependencies of your application by using a Docker image. The dependencies travel with the\napplication when you deploy the containers.\n\nAn additional benefit is that developers can run the application in the consistent environment ', "that's\nprovided by Windows Containers. Issues that appear only with certain versions can be spotted\nimmediately, instead of surfacing in a staging or production environment. Differences in development\nenvironments used by members of the development team matter less when applications run in\ncontainers.\n\nContainerized applications also have a flatter scale-out curve. Containerized apps enable you to have\nmore application and service instances (base", 'd on containers) in a VM or physical machine compared\nto regular application deployments per machine. This approach translates to higher density and fewer\nrequired resources, especially when you use orchestrators like Kubernetes.\n\nContainerization, in ideal situations, does not require making any changes to the application code\n(C#). In most scenarios, you just need the Docker deployment metadata files (Dockerfiles and Docker\nCompose files).\n\nNex', 't steps\n\nExplore this content more in-depth on the GitHub wiki:\n\n° How to containerize the .NET Framework web apps with Windows Containers and Docker\n° Adding Docker Support to a WCF service\n\n43 CHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview\nWalkthrough 3: Deploy your Windows Containers-\nbased app to Azure VMs\n\nTechnical walkthrough availability\n\nThe full technical walkthrough Is available in the eshopModernizing GitHub repo wiki:\n\nC', 'ontainers- based-app-into-Azure-VMs-(Including-Cl-CD)\n\nOverview\n\nDeploying to a Docker host on a Windows Server 2016 Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure lets you quickly\nset up development/test/staging environments.

Container-based solutions ultimately provide cost savings benefits. Containers are a solution\nto deployment', ' problems because they remove the friction caused by an absence of\ndependencies in production environments. By removing those issues, it improves Dev/Test,\nDevOps, and production operations significantly.\n\n. A Docker container is becoming the standard unit of deployment for any server-based\napplication or service.\n\n. For production environments, you should use an orchestrator (like Kubernetes) to host\nscalable containers—based applications.\n\n. Az', 'ure VMs hosting containers are a fast and simple way to create small Dev/Test\nenvironments in the cloud.\n\n. Azure SQL Database Managed Instance is recommended by default when migrating your\nrelational databases from existing applications to Azure.\n\n. Visual Studio 2022 and Image2Docker are basic tools for you to start modernizing your\nexisting .NET applications with Windows Containers by accelerating the getting started\nlearning curve.\n\n. When pl', 'acing containerized applications in production you will always create or adopt a\nDevOps culture and DevOps tools for CI/CD pipelines, like Azure DevOps Services or Jenkins.\n\n. Microsoft Azure provides the most comprehensive and complete environment to modernize\nyour existing .NET Framework applications with Windows Containers, cloud infrastructure and\nPaaS services.\n\n53 CHAPTER 5 | Conclusions\n']
