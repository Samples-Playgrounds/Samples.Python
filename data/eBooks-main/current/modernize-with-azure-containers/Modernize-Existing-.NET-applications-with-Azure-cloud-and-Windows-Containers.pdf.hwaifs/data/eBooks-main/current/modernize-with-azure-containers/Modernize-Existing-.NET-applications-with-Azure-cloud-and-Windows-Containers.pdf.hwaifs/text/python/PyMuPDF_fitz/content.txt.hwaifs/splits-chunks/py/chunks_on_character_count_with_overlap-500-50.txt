Rearchitecting an application by using an \nadvanced approach like microservices isn’t always an option because of cost and time restraints. \nDepending on the type of application, rearchitecting an app also might not be necessary. To optimize \nthe ', 'cost-effectiveness of your organization’s cloud migration strategy, it’s important to consider the \nneeds of your business and the requirements of your apps. You’ll need to determine: \n• \nWhich apps require a transformation or rearchitecting. \n• \nWhich apps need to be only partially modernized. \n• \nWhich apps you can “lift and shift” directly to the cloud. \n \nAbout this guide \nThis guide focuses primarily on the initial modernization of existing ', 'Microsoft .NET Framework web or \nservice-oriented applications, meaning the action of moving a workload to a newer or more modern \nenvironment without significantly altering the application’s code and basic architecture. \nThis guide also highlights the benefits of moving your apps to the cloud and partially modernizing \napps by using a specific set of new technologies and approaches, like Windows Containers and \nrelated compute-platforms in Azure', ' supporting Windows Containers. \nPath to the cloud for existing .NET applications \nOrganizations typically choose to move to the cloud for the agility and speed they can get for their \napplications. You can set up thousands of servers (VMs) in the cloud in minutes, compared to the \nweeks it typically takes to set up on-premises servers. \nThere isn’t a single, one-size-fits-all strategy for migrating applications to the cloud. The right \nmigration', ' strategy for you will depend on your organization’s needs and priorities, and the kind of \napplications you are migrating. Not all applications warrant the investment of moving to a platform as \na service (PaaS) model or developing a cloud-native application model. In many cases, you can take a \nphased or incremental approach to invest in moving your assets to the cloud, based on your business \nneeds. \nFor modern applications with the best long-', 'term agility and value for the organization, you might \nbenefit from investing in cloud-native application architectures. However, for applications that are \nexisting or legacy assets, the key is to spend minimal time and money (no rearchitecting or code \nchanges) while moving them to the cloud, to realize significant benefits. \nFigure 1-1 shows the possible paths you can take when you move existing .NET applications to the \ncloud in incremental ', 'phases. \n \n \n \nFigure 1-1. Modernization paths for existing .NET applications and services \nEach migration approach has different benefits and reasons for using it. You can choose a single \napproach when you migrate apps to the cloud, or choose certain components from multiple \napproaches. Individual applications aren’t limited to a single approach or maturity state. For instance, \na common hybrid approach would have certain on-premises component', 's plus other components in \nthe cloud. \nThe definition and short explanation for each application maturity level are the following: \nLevel 1: Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications: In this migration approach, you just migrate or \nrehost your current on-premises applications to an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform. Your \napps have almost the same composition as before, but now you deploy them to VMs in the cloud. \nThis simple type of m', 'igration is typically known in the industry as “Lift & Shift.” \nLevel 2: Cloud Optimized applications: At this level and still without rearchitecting or altering \nsignificant code, you can gain additional benefits from running your app in the cloud with modern \ntechnologies like containers and additional cloud-managed services. You improve the agility of your \napplications to ship faster by refining your enterprise development operations (DevOps)', ' processes. \nYou achieve this functionality by using technologies like Windows Containers, which is based on \nDocker Engine. Containers remove the friction that’s caused by application dependencies when you \ndeploy in multiple stages. In this maturity model, you can deploy containers on IaaS or PaaS while \nusing additional cloud-managed services related to databases, cache as a service, monitoring, and \ncontinuous integration/continuous deploymen', 't (CI/CD) pipelines. \nThe third level of maturity is the ultimate goal in the cloud, but it’s optional for many apps and not the \nmain focus of this guide: \n \nLevel 3: Cloud-Native applications: This migration approach typically is driven by business need and \ntargets modernizing your mission-critical applications. At this level, you use PaaS services to move \nyour apps to PaaS computing platforms. You implement cloud-native applications and micr', 'oservices \narchitecture to evolve applications with long-term agility, and to scale to new limits. This type of \nmodernization usually requires architecting specifically for the cloud. New code often must be written, \nespecially when you move to cloud-native application and microservice-based models. This approach \ncan help you gain benefits that are difficult to achieve in your monolithic and on-premises application \nenvironment. \nTable 1-1 desc', 'ribes the main benefits of and reasons for choosing each migration or modernization \napproach. \nCloud Infrastructure-Ready \nLift and shift \nCloud-Optimized \nModernize \nCloud-Native \nModernize, rearchitect, and \nrewrite \nApplication’s compute target \n \n \nApplications deployed to VMs \nin Azure \nMonolithic or N-Tier apps \ndeployed to Azure App Service, \nAzure Container Instance (ACI), \nVMs with containers, or AKS \n(Azure Kubernetes Service) \nContain', 'erized microservices on \nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS) \nand/or serverless microservices \nbased on Azure Functions. \nData target \n \n \nSQL or any relational database \non a VM \nAzure SQL Database Managed \nInstance or another managed \ndatabase in the cloud. \nFined-grain databases per \nmicroservice, based on Azure \nSQL Database, Azure Cosmos \nDB, or another managed \ndatabase in the cloud \nAdvantages \n \n \n \n \n \nChallenges \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1-1. Benefit', 's and challenges of modernization paths for existing .NET applications and services \nKey technologies and architectures by maturity level \n.NET Framework applications initially started with .NET Framework version 1.0, which was released in \nlate 2001. Then, companies moved towards newer versions (such as 2.0, 3.5 and .NET Framework 4.x). \nMost of those applications ran on Windows Server and Internet Information Server (IIS), and used a \nrelationa', 'l database, like SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or any other RDBMS. \nMost existing .NET applications might nowadays be based on .NET Framework 4.x, or even on .NET \nFramework 3.5, and use web frameworks like ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET Web API, \nWindows Communication Foundation (WCF), ASP.NET SignalR, and ASP.NET Web Pages. These \nestablished .NET Framework technologies depend on Windows. That dependency is important to \n \nconsider if you', ' are simply migrating legacy apps and you want to make minimal changes to your \napplication infrastructure. \nFigure 1-2 shows the primary technologies and architecture styles used at each of the three cloud \nmaturity levels: \n \nFigure 1-2. Primary technologies for each maturity level for modernizing existing .NET web applications \nFigure 1-2 highlights the most common scenarios, but many hybrid and mixed variations are possible \nwhen it comes to ', 'architecture. For example, the maturity models apply not only to monolithic \narchitectures in existing web apps, but also to service orientation, N-Tier, and other architecture style \nvariations. The higher focus or percentage on one or another architecture type and related \ntechnologies determines the overall maturity level of your applications. \nEach maturity level in the modernization process is associated with the following key technologies a', 'nd \napproaches: \n• \nCloud Infrastructure-Ready (rehost or basic lift & shift): As a first step, many organizations \nwant only to quickly execute a cloud-migration strategy. In this case, applications are \nrehosted. Most rehosting can be automated by using Azure Migrate, a service that provides \nthe guidance, insights, and mechanisms needed to assist you in migrating to Azure based on \ncloud tools like Azure Site Recovery and Azure Database Migrat', 'ion Service. You can also set \nup rehosting manually, so that you can learn infrastructure details about your assets when \nyou move legacy apps to the cloud. For example, you can move your applications to VMs in \nAzure with little modification-probably with only minor configuration changes. The \nnetworking in this case is similar to an on-premises environment, especially if you create \nvirtual networks in Azure. \n• \nCloud-Optimized (Managed Servi', 'ces and Windows Containers): This model is about making \na few important deployment optimizations to gain some significant benefits from the cloud, \n \nwithout changing the core architecture of the application. The fundamental step here is to \nadd Windows Containers support to your existing .NET Framework applications. This \nimportant step (containerization) doesn’t require touching the code, so the overall lift and \nshift effort is light. You can', ' use tools like Image2Docker or Visual Studio, with its tools for \nDocker. Visual Studio automatically chooses smart defaults for ASP.NET applications and \nWindows Containers images. These tools offer both a rapid inner loop, and a fast path to get \nthe containers to Azure. Your agility is improved when you deploy to multiple environments. \nThen, moving to production, you can deploy your Windows Containers to Azure Web App for \nContainers, Azure ', 'Container Instances (ACI), and Azure VMs with Windows Server 2016 and \ncontainers if you prefer an IaaS approach. For more complex multi-container applications, \nconsider using orchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS/ACS). \nDuring this initial modernization, you can also add assets from the cloud, such as monitoring with \ntools like Azure Application Insights; CI/CD pipelines for your app lifecycles with Azure DevOps \nServices; and many ', 'more data resource services that are available in Azure. For instance, you can \nmodify a monolithic web app that was originally developed by using traditional ASP.NET Web Forms \nor ASP.NET MVC, but now you deploy it by using Windows Containers. When you use Windows \nContainers, you should also migrate your data to a database in Azure SQL Database Managed \nInstance, all without changing the core architecture of your application. \n• \nCloud-Native: ', 'As introduced, you should think about architecting cloud-native applications \nwhen you are targeting large and complex applications with multiple independent \ndevelopment teams working on different microservices that can be developed and deployed \nautonomously. Also, due to granularized and independent scalability per microservice. These \narchitectural approaches face very important challenges and complexities but can be greatly \nsimplified by us', 'ing cloud PaaS and orchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS/ACS) \n(managed Kubernetes), and Azure Functions for a serverless approach. All these approaches \n(like microservices and Serverless) typically require you to architect for the cloud and write \nnew code—code that is adapted to specific PaaS platforms, or code that aligns with specific \narchitectures, like microservices. \nFigure 1-3 shows the internal technologies that you can use ', 'for each maturity level: \n \n \nFigure 1-3. Internal technologies for each modernization maturity level \nLift and shift scenario \nFor lift and shift migrations, keep in mind that you can use many different variations of lift and shift in \nyour application scenarios. If you only rehost your application, you might have a scenario like the one \nshown in Figure 1-4, where you use VMs in the cloud only for your application and for your database \nserver.', ' \n \n \nFigure 1-4. Example of a pure IaaS scenario in the cloud \nModernization scenarios \nFor modernization scenarios, you might have a pure Cloud-Optimized application that uses elements \nonly from that maturity level. Or, you might have an intermediate-state application with some \nelements from Cloud Infrastructure-Ready and other elements from Cloud-Optimized (a “pick and \nchoose” or mixed model), like in Figure 1-5. \n \n \nFigure 1-5. Example “p', 'ick and choose” scenario, with database on IaaS, DevOps, and containerization assets \nNext, as the ideal scenario for many existing .NET Framework applications to migrate, you could \nmigrate to a Cloud-Optimized application, to get significant benefits from little work. This approach \nalso sets you up for Cloud-Native as a possible future evolution. Figure 1-6 shows an example. \n \n \nFigure 1-6. Example Cloud-Optimized apps scenario, with Windows ', 'Containers and managed services \nGoing even further, you could extend your existing Cloud-Optimized application by adding a few \nmicroservices for specific scenarios. This approach would move you partially to the level of Cloud-\nNative model, which is not the main focus of the present guidance. \nWhat this guide does not cover \nThis guide covers a specific subset of the example scenarios, as shown in Figure 1-7. This guide \nfocuses only on the lif', 't and shift scenarios, and ultimately, on the Cloud-Optimized model. In the \nCloud-Optimized model, a .NET Framework application is modernized by using Windows Containers, \nplus additional components like monitoring and CI/CD pipelines. Each component is fundamental to \ndeploying applications to the cloud, faster, and with agility. \n \n \nFigure 1-7. Cloud-Native is not covered in this guide \nThe focus of this guide is specific. It shows you the pa', 'th you can take to achieve a lift and shift of your \nexisting .NET applications, without rearchitecting, and with no code changes. Ultimately, it shows you \nhow to make your application Cloud-Optimized. \nThis guide doesn’t show you how to create Cloud-Native applications, such as how to evolve to a \nmicroservices architecture.

The \ncontent in the first few chapters of the guide is designed for architects and technical decisi', 'on makers \nwho want an overview, but who don’t need to focus on implementation and technical, step-by-step \ndetails. \nThe last chapter of this guide introduces multiple walkthroughs that focus on specific deployment \nscenarios. This guide offers shorter versions of the walkthroughs, to summarize the scenarios and \nhighlight their benefits. The full walkthroughs drill down into setup and implementation details, and \nare published as a set of wiki ', 'posts in the same public GitHub repo where related sample apps reside \n(discussed in the next section). The last chapter and the step-by-step wiki walkthroughs on GitHub will \nbe of more interest to developers and architects who want to focus on implementation details. \nSample apps for modernizing legacy apps: \neShopModernizing \nThe eShopModernizing repo on GitHub offers two sample applications that simulate legacy \nmonolithic web applications. O', 'ne web app is developed by using ASP.NET MVC; the second web app \nis developed by using ASP.NET Web Forms and the third app is an N-Tier app with a WinForms client \ndesktop app consuming a WCF service backend. All these apps are based on the traditional .NET \nFramework. These sample apps don’t use .NET Core/.NET 7 or ASP.NET Core as they are supposed to \nbe existing/legacy .NET Framework applications to be modernized. \nThese sample apps have a se', 'cond version, with modernized code, and which are fairly straightforward. \nThe most important difference between the app versions is that the second versions use Windows \nContainers as the deployment choice. There also are a few additions to the second versions, like Azure \nStorage Blobs for managing images, Azure Active Directory for managing security, and Azure \nApplication Insights for monitoring and auditing the applications. \n \ni \nContents \n', ' \nContents \nLift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure IaaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready) ................. 1 \nWhy migrate existing .NET web applications to Azure IaaS ................................................................................... 2 \nWhen to migrate to IaaS instead of to PaaS ................................................................................................................. 2 \nUse Azure Migrate to analyze and mig', 'rate your existing applications to Azure ........................................... 2 \nUse Azure Site Recovery to migrate your existing VMs to Azure VMs .............................................................. 3 \nAdditional resources .......................................................................................................................................................... 4 \nMigrate your relational databases to Azure ........', '................................................................. 6 \nWhen to migrate to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance ............................................................................... 7 \nWhen to migrate to Azure SQL Database ...................................................................................................................... 8 \nWhen to move your original RDBMS to a VM (IaaS) ...................................', '.............................................................. 8 \nWhen to migrate to SQL Server as a VM (IaaS) ........................................................................................................... 9 \nUse Azure Database Migration Service to migrate your relational databases to Azure ............................. 9 \nAdditional resources ...........................................................................................', '................................................................. 10 \nModernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications .................................... 11 \nReasons to modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications .............................................. 12 \nCloud-Optimized application principles and tenets .......................................................................................... 12 \nBenefits o', 'f a Cloud-Optimized application ........................................................................................................... 14 \nMicrosoft technologies in cloud-optimized applications ..................................................................................... 14 \nMonolithic applications can be Cloud-Optimized .............................................................................................. 15 \nWhat about Clou', 'd-Native applications? ..................................................................................................................... 16 \nCloud-native applications details .............................................................................................................................. 17 \nWhat about microservices? ..................................................................................................................', '........................ 18 \nDeploy existing .NET apps as Windows containers ................................................................................................. 19 \nWhat are containers?

to Azure IaaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready) \n \nCHAPTER 1 \nLift and shift existing .NET \napps to Azure IaaS (Cloud \nInfrastructure-Ready) \nVision: As a first step, to reduce your on-premises investment and total cost of hardware and \nnetworking maintenance, simply rehost your ex', 'isting applications in the cloud. \nBefore getting into how to migrate your existing applications to the Azure infrastructure as a service \n(IaaS) platform, it’s important to analyze the reasons why you’d want to migrate directly to IaaS in \nAzure. The scenario at this modernization maturity level essentially is to start using VMs in the cloud, \ninstead of continuing to use your current, on-premises infrastructure. \nAnother point to analyze is why', ' you might want to migrate to pure IaaS cloud instead of just adding \nmore advanced managed services in Azure. Determine what cases might require IaaS in the first place. \nFigure 2-1 positions Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications in the modernization maturity levels: \n \nFigure 2-1. Positioning Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications \n \n2 \nCHAPTER 1 | Lift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure IaaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready) \n \nWhy migrate ex', 'isting .NET web applications to \nAzure IaaS \nThe main reason to migrate to the cloud, even at an initial IaaS level, is to achieve cost reductions. By \nusing more managed infrastructure services, your organization can lower its investment in hardware \nmaintenance, server or VM provisioning and deployment, and infrastructure management. \nAfter you make the decision to move your apps to the cloud, the main reason why you might choose \nIaaS instead ', 'of more advanced options like PaaS is simply that the IaaS environment will be more \nfamiliar. Moving to an environment that’s similar to your current, on-premises environment offers a \nlower learning curve, which makes it the quickest path to the cloud. \nHowever, taking the quickest path to the cloud doesn’t mean that you will gain the most benefit from \nhaving your applications running in the cloud. Any organization will gain the most significa', 'nt benefits \nfrom a cloud migration at the already introduced Cloud-Optimized and Cloud-Native maturity levels. \nIt also has become evident that applications are easier to modernize and rearchitect in the future \nwhen they are already running in the cloud, even on IaaS. Application data migration has already been \nachieved. Also, your organization will have gained the skills required for working in the cloud and \nmade the shift to operating in a ', '“cloud culture.” \nWhen to migrate to IaaS instead of to PaaS \nThe next sections discuss Cloud-Optimized applications that are mostly based on PaaS platforms and \nservices. These apps give you the most benefits from migrating to the cloud. \nIf your goal is simply to move existing applications to the cloud, first, identify existing applications that \nwould not require substantial modification to run in Azure App Service. These apps should be the fi', 'rst \ncandidates for Cloud-Optimized. \nThen, for the apps that still cannot move to Windows Containers and PaaS such as App Service or \norchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service, migrate those apps to simple plain VMs (IaaS). \nBut, keep in mind that correctly configuring, securing, and maintaining VMs requires much more time \nand IT expertise compared to using PaaS services in Azure. If you are considering Azure Virtual \nMachines, make sure that', ' you take into account the ongoing maintenance effort required to patch, \nupdate, and manage your VM environment. Azure Virtual Machines is IaaS. \nUse Azure Migrate to analyze and migrate your \nexisting applications to Azure \nMigrating to the cloud doesn’t have to be difficult. But many organizations struggle to get started - to \nget deep visibility into the environment and the tight interdependencies between applications, \nworkloads, and data. W', 'ithout that visibility, it can be difficult to plan the path forward. Without \ndetailed information on what’s required for a successful migration, you can’t have the right \n \n3 \nCHAPTER 1 | Lift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure IaaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready) \n \nconversations within your organization. You don’t know enough about the potential cost benefits, or \nwhether workloads could just lift-and-shift or would require significant rework', ' to migrate successfully. \nNo wonder many organizations hesitate. \nAzure Migrate is a new service that provides the guidance, insights, and mechanisms needed to assist \nyou in migrating to Azure. Azure Migrate provides: \n• \nDiscovery and assessment for on-premises virtual machines \n• \nInbuilt dependency mapping for high-confidence discovery of multi-tier applications \n• \nIntelligent right sizing to Azure virtual machines \n• \nCompatibility reporti', 'ng with guidelines for remediating potential issues \n• \nIntegration with Azure Database Management Service for database discovery and migration \nAzure Migrate gives you confidence that your workloads can migrate with minimal impact to the \nbusiness and run as expected in Azure. With the right tools and guidance, you can achieve maximum \nreturn on investment while assuring that critical performance and reliability needs are met. \nFigure 2-2 shows ', 'you the built-in dependency mapping for all server and application connections \nperformed by Azure Migrate. \n \nFigure 2-2. Positioning Cloud Infrastructure-Ready applications \nUse Azure Site Recovery to migrate your existing \nVMs to Azure VMs \nAs part of the end-to-end Azure Migrate, Azure Site Recovery is a tool that you can use to easily \nmigrate your web apps to VMs in Azure. You can use Site Recovery to replicate on-premises VMs and \nphysical', ' servers to Azure, or to replicate them to a secondary on-premises location. You can even \nreplicate a workload that’s running on a supported Azure VM, on an on-premises Hyper-V VM, on a \nVMware VM, or on a Windows or Linux physical server. Replication to Azure eliminates the cost and \ncomplexity of maintaining a secondary datacenter. \n \n4 \nCHAPTER 1 | Lift and shift existing .NET apps to Azure IaaS (Cloud Infrastructure-Ready) \n \nSite Recovery i', 's also made specifically for hybrid environments that are partly on-premises and partly \non Azure. Site Recovery helps ensure business continuity by keeping your apps that are running on \nVMs and on-premises physical servers available if a site goes down. It replicates workloads that are \nrunning on VMs and physical servers so that they remain available in a secondary location if the \nprimary site isn’t available. It recovers workloads to the pri', 'mary site when it’s up and running again. \nFigure 2-3 shows the execution of multiple VM migrations by using Azure Site Recovery. \n \nFigure 2-3.

Azure SQL Database offers the managed \ninstance and full database-as-a-service (DBaaS) options. Figure 3-1 shows t', 'he multiple relational \ndatabase migration paths available in Azure. \n \nFigure 3-1. Database migration paths in Azure \n \n7 \nCHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure \n \nWhen to migrate to Azure SQL Database Managed \nInstance \nIn most cases, Azure SQL Database Managed Instance will be your best option to consider when you \nmigrate your data to Azure. If you are migrating SQL Server databases and need nearly 100% \nassurance that you wo', 'n’t need to rearchitect your application or make changes to your data or data \naccess code, choose the Managed Instance feature of Azure SQL Database. \nAzure SQL Database Managed Instance is the best option if you have additional requirements for SQL \nServer instance-level functionality, or isolation requirements beyond the features provided in a \nstandard Azure SQL Database (single database model). This last one is the most PaaS-oriented choice,', ' \nbut it doesn’t offer the same features as that of a traditional SQL server. Migration might surface \nfrictions. \nFor example, an organization that has made deep investments in instance-level SQL Server capabilities \nwould benefit from migrating to SQL Managed Instance. Examples of instance-level SQL Server \ncapabilities include SQL common language runtime (CLR) integration, SQL Server Agent, and cross-\ndatabase querying. Support for these featu', 'res is not available in standard Azure SQL Database (a \nsingle-database model). \nAn organization that operates in a highly regulated industry, and which needs to maintain isolation for \nsecurity purposes, also might benefit from choosing the SQL Managed Instance model. \nManaged Instance in Azure SQL Database has the following characteristics: \n• \nSecurity isolation through Azure Virtual Network \n• \nApplication surface compatibility, with these fe', 'atures: \n– \nSQL Server Agent and SQL Server Profiler \n– \nCross-database references and queries, SQL CLR, replication, change data capture \n(CDC), and Service Broker \n• \nDatabase sizes up to 35 TB \n• \nMinimum-downtime migration, with these features: \n– \nAzure Database Migration Service \n– \nNative backup and restore, and log shipping \nWith these capabilities, when you migrate existing application databases to Azure SQL Database, the \nManaged Instan', 'ce model offers nearly 100% of the benefits of PaaS for SQL Server. Managed Instance \nis a SQL Server environment where you continue using instance-level capabilities without changing \nyour application design. \nManaged Instance is probably the best fit for enterprises that currently are using SQL Server, and \nwhich require flexibility in their network security in the cloud. It’s like having a private virtual network \nfor your SQL databases. \n \n8 ', '\nCHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure \n \nWhen to migrate to Azure SQL Database \nAs mentioned, the standard Azure SQL Database is a fully managed, relational DBaaS. SQL Database \ncurrently manages millions of production databases, across 38 datacenters, around the world. It \nsupports a broad range of applications and workloads, from managing straightforward transactional \ndata, to driving the most data-intensive, mission-critical', ' applications that require advanced data \nprocessing at a global scale. \nBecause of its full PaaS features, better pricing-and ultimately lower cost-you should move to the \nstandard Azure SQL Database as your “by-default choice” if you have an application that uses basic, \nstandard SQL databases, and no additional instance features. SQL Server features like SQL CLR \nintegration, SQL Server Agent, and cross-database querying are not supported in t', 'he standard Azure \nSQL Database. Those features are available only in the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance model. \nAzure SQL Database is the only intelligent cloud database service that’s built for app developers. It’s \nalso the only cloud database service that scales on-the-fly, without downtime, to help you efficiently \ndeliver multitenant apps. Ultimately, Azure SQL Database leaves you more time to innovate, and it \naccelerates your time to', ' market. You can build secure apps and connect to your SQL database by \nusing the languages and platforms that you prefer. \nAzure SQL Database offers the following benefits: \n• \nBuilt-in intelligence (machine learning) that learns and adapts to your app \n• \nOn-demand database provisioning \n• \nA range of offers, for all workloads \n• \n99.99% availability SLA, zero maintenance \n• \nGeo-replication and restore services for data protection \n• \nAzure SQ', 'L Database Point in Time Restore feature \n• \nCompatibility with SQL Server 2016, including hybrid and migration \nThe standard Azure SQL Database is closer to PaaS than Azure SQL Database Managed Instance. \nPrefer the standard Azure SQL Database because you’ll get more benefits from a managed cloud. \nHowever, Azure SQL Database has some key differences from regular and on-premises SQL Server \ninstances. Depending on your existing application’s dat', 'abase requirements, and your enterprise \nrequirements and policies, it might not be the best choice when you are planning your migration to \nthe cloud. \nWhen to move your original RDBMS to a VM (IaaS) \nOne of your migration options is to move your original relational database management system \n(RDBMS), including Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, to a similar server that’s \nrunning on an Azure VM. If you have existing application', 's that require the fastest migration to the \ncloud with minimal changes, or no changes at all, a direct migration to IaaS in the cloud might be a \n \n9 \nCHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure \n \nfair option. It might not be the best way to take advantage of all the cloud’s benefits, but it’s probably \nthe fastest initial path. \nCurrently, Microsoft Azure supports up to 331 different database servers deployed as IaaS VMs. These \ninc', 'lude popular RDBMS like SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM DB2, and many other \nNoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, DataStax, MariaDB, and Cloudera. \nNote \nAlthough moving your RDBMS to an Azure VM might be the fastest way to migrate your data to the \ncloud (because it is IaaS), this approach requires a significant investment in your IT teams (database \nadministrators and IT pros). Enterprise teams need to be able to set up and m', 'anage high availability, \ndisaster recovery, and patching for SQL Server. This context also needs a customized environment, \nwith full administrative rights. \nWhen to migrate to SQL Server as a VM (IaaS) \nThere might be a few cases where you still need to migrate to SQL Server as a regular VM. An \nexample scenario is if you need to use SQL Server Reporting Services. In most cases, though, Azure \nSQL Database Managed Instance can provide everythin', 'g you need to migrate from on-premises SQL \nservers, so migration to a SQL Server VM should be your last resort to try. \nUse Azure Database Migration Service to migrate \nyour relational databases to Azure \nYou can use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate relational databases like SQL Server, and \nMySQL to Azure, whether your target database is Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Database Managed \nInstance, or SQL Server on an Azure VM. \nThe auto', 'mated workflow, with assessment reporting, guides you through the changes you need to \nmake before you migrate the database. When you are ready, the service migrates the source database \nto Azure. \nWhenever you change an original RDBMS, you might need to retest. You also might need to change \nthe SQL sentences or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) code in your application, depending on \ntesting results. \nIf you have any other database (for example, ', 'IBM DB2) and you opt for a lift and shift approach, you \nmight want to continue using those databases as IaaS VMs in Azure, unless you are willing to perform \na more complex data migration. A more complex data migration will require additional effort because \nyou’d be migrating to a different database type with the new schema and different programming \nlibraries. \n \n10 \nCHAPTER 2 | Migrate your relational databases to Azure \n \nAdditional resource', 's \n• \nChoose a cloud SQL Server option: Azure SQL Database (PaaS) or SQL Server on Azure \nVM (IaaS) \n  \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-paas-vs-sql-server-iaas \n• \nSQL Server database migration to SQL Database in the cloud \n  \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-cloud-migrate \n• \nAzure SQL Database \n  \nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/?v=16.50 \n• \nSQL Server on virtual machines ', '\n  \nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/ \n \n11 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nCHAPTER 3 \nModernize existing .NET \napps to Cloud-Optimized \napplications \nVision: Modernize your existing .NET Framework applications to Cloud-Optimized applications to \ndrastically improve your deployment agility, so you can ship faster and lower application’s delivery \ncosts. \nTo take advantag', 'e of the benefits of the cloud and new technologies like containers, you should at \nleast partially modernize your existing .NET applications. Ultimately, modernizing your enterprise \napplications will lower your total cost of ownership. \nPartially modernizing an app doesn’t necessarily mean a full migration and rearchitecture. You can \ninitially modernize your existing applications with important but easy to do modernization. You can \nmaintain y', 'our current code base, written in existing .NET Framework versions, with any Windows and \nIIS dependencies. Figure 4-1 highlights how Cloud-Optimized apps are positioned in Azure \napplication modernization maturity models. \n \nFigure 4-1. Positioning Cloud-Optimized applications \n \n12 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nReasons to modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-\nOptimized applications \nWith a Cloud-O', 'ptimized application, you can rapidly and repeatedly deliver reliable applications to \nyour customers. You gain essential agility and reliability by deferring much of the operational \ncomplexity of your app to the platform. \nIf you can’t get your applications to market quickly, by the time you ship your app, the market you \nwere targeting will have evolved. You might be too late, no matter how well the application was \narchitected or engineered. ', 'You might be failing or not reaching your full potential because you can’t \nsync app delivery with the needs of the market. \nThe need for continuous business innovation pushes development and operations teams to the limit. \nThe only way to achieve the agility you need in continuous business innovation is by modernizing \nyour applications with technologies like containers and specific Cloud-Optimized application \nprinciples. \nThe bottom line is th', 'at when an organization builds and manages applications that are Cloud-\nOptimized, it can put solutions in the hands of customers sooner and bring new ideas to market when \nthey are relevant. \nCloud-Optimized application principles and tenets \nImprovements in the cloud are mostly focused on meeting two goals: Reduce costs and improve \nbusiness growth by improving agility. These goals are achieved by simplifying processes and reducing \nfriction wh', 'en you release and ship applications. \nYour application is Cloud-Optimized if you can-in an agile manner-develop your app autonomously \nfrom other on-premises apps, and then release, deploy, autoscale, monitor, and troubleshoot your \napp in the cloud. \nThe key is agility. You can’t ship with agility unless you reduce to an absolute minimum any \ndeployment-to-production issues and dev/test environment issues. Containers (specifically, Docker, as \n', 'a de facto standard) and managed services were designed specifically for this purpose. \nTo achieve agility, you also need automated DevOps processes that are based on CI/CD pipelines that \nrelease to scalable platforms in the cloud. CI/CD platforms (like Azure DevOps Services or Jenkins) that \ndeploy to a scalable and resilient cloud platform (like Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service) \nare key technologies for achieving agility in the c', 'loud. \nThe following list describes the main tenets or practices for Cloud-Optimized applications. Note that \nyou can adopt all or only some of these principles, in a progressive or incremental approach: \n• \nContainers. Containers give you the ability to include application dependencies with the \napplication itself. Containerization significantly reduces the number of issues you might \nencounter when you deploy to production environments or test ', 'in staging environments. \nUltimately, containers improve the agility of application delivery. \n \n13 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \n• \nResilient and scalable cloud. The cloud provides a platform that is managed, elastic, \nscalable, and resilient. These characteristics are fundamental to gain cost improvements and \nship highly available and reliable applications in a continuous delivery. Managed service', 's like \nmanaged databases, managed cache as a service (CaaS), and managed storage are \nfundamental pieces in alleviating the maintenance costs of your application. \n• \nMonitoring. You can’t have a reliable application without having a good way to detect and \ndiagnose exceptions and application performance issues. You need to get actionable insights \nthrough application performance management and instant analytics. \n• \nDevOps culture and continuou', 's delivery. Adopting DevOps practices requires a cultural \nchange in which teams no longer work in independent silos. CI/CD pipelines are possible only \nwhen there is an increased collaboration between development and IT operations teams, \nsupported by containers and CI/CD tools. \nFigure 4-2 shows the main optional pillars of a Cloud-Optimized application. The more pillars you \nimplement, the readier your application will be to succeed in meeting', ' your customers’ expectations. \n \nFigure 4-2. Main pillars of a Cloud-Optimized application \nTo summarize, a Cloud-Optimized application is an approach to building and managing applications \nthat takes advantage of the cloud computing model, while using a combination of containers, \nmanaged cloud infrastructure, resilient application techniques, monitoring, continuous delivery, and \nDevOps, all without the need to rearchitect and recode your exis', 'ting applications. \nYour organization can adopt these technologies and approaches gradually. You don’t have to \nembrace all of them, all at once. You can adopt them incrementally, depending on enterprise priorities \nand user needs. \n \n14 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nBenefits of a Cloud-Optimized application \nYou can get the following benefits by converting an existing application to a Cloud-Optimize', 'd \napplication (without rearchitecting or coding): \n• \nLower costs, because the managed infrastructure is handled by the cloud provider. \nCloud-Optimized applications get the benefits of the cloud by using the cloud’s out-of-the-\nbox elasticity, autoscale, and high availability. Benefits are related not only to the compute \nfeatures (VMs and containers), but also depend on the resources in the cloud, like DBaaS, \nCaaS, and any infrastructure an a', 'pplication might needed. \n• \nResilient application and infrastructure. When you migrate to the cloud, you need to \nembrace transient failures; failures will occur in the cloud. Also, cloud infrastructure and \nhardware are “replaceable,” which increases opportunities for transient downtime. At the \nsame time, inner cloud capabilities and certain application development techniques that \nimplement resiliency and automate recovery make it much easier', ' to recover from unexpected \nfailures in the cloud. \n• \nDeeper insights into application performance. Cloud monitoring tools like Azure \nApplication Insights provide visualization for health management, logging, and notifications. \nAudit logs make applications easy to debug and audit, fundamental for a reliable cloud \napplication. \n• \nApplication portability, with agile deployments. Containers (either Linux or Windows \ncontainers based on Docker ', 'Engine) offer the best solution to avoiding a cloud-locked \napplication. By using containers, Docker hosts, and multi-cloud orchestrators, you can easily \nmove from one environment or cloud to another. Containers eliminate the friction that \ntypically occurs in deployments to any environment (stage/test/production). \nAll of these benefits ultimately provide key cost reductions for your end-to-end application lifecycle. \nIn the following sections,', ' these benefits are explained in more detail, and are linked to specific \ntechnologies. \nMicrosoft technologies in cloud-optimized \napplications \nThe following list describes the tools, technologies, and solutions that are recognized as requirements \nfor Cloud-Optimized apps. You can adopt Cloud-Optimized elements selectively or gradually, \ndepending on your priorities. \n• \nCloud infrastructure: The infrastructure that provides the compute platfo', 'rm, operating \nsystem, network, and storage. Microsoft Azure is positioned at this level. \n• \nRuntime: This layer provides the environment for the application to run. If you are using \ncontainers, this layer usually is based on Docker Engine, running either on Linux hosts or on \nWindows hosts. (Windows Containers are supported beginning with Windows Server 2016. \n \n15 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nWi', 'ndows Containers is the best choice for existing .NET Framework applications that run on \nWindows.) \n• \nManaged cloud: When you choose a managed cloud option, you can avoid the expense and \ncomplexity of managing and supporting the underlying infrastructure, VMs, OS patches, and \nnetworking configuration. If you choose to migrate by using IaaS, you are responsible for all \nof these tasks, and for associated costs. In a managed cloud option, you m', 'anage only the \napplications and services that you develop. The cloud service provider typically manages \neverything else. Examples of managed cloud services in Azure include Azure SQL Database, \nAzure Redis Cache, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Storage, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure \nDatabase for PostgreSQL, Azure Active Directory, and managed compute services like VM \nscale sets, Azure App Service, and Azure Kubernetes Service. \n• \nApplication develo', 'pment: You can choose from many languages when you build \napplications that run in containers. This guide focuses on .NET, but, you can develop \ncontainer-based apps by using other languages, like Node.js, Python, Spring/Java, or Go. \n• \nMonitoring, telemetry, logging, and auditing: The ability to monitor and audit applications \nand containers that are running in the cloud is critical for any Cloud-Optimized application. \nAzure Application Insigh', 'ts and Microsoft Operations Management Suite are the main \nMicrosoft tools that provide monitoring and auditing for Cloud-Optimized apps. \n• \nProvisioning: Automation tools help you provision the infrastructure and deploy an \napplication to multiple environments (production, testing, staging). You can use tools like \nChef and Puppet to manage an application’s configuration and environment. This layer also \ncan be implemented by using simpler and ', 'more direct approaches. For example, you can \ndeploy directly by using Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) tooling, and then use the \ncontinuous deployment and release management pipelines in Azure DevOps Services. \n• \nApplication lifecycle: Azure DevOps Services and other tools, like Jenkins, are built \nautomation servers that help you implement CI/CD pipelines, including release management. \nThe next sections of this chapter, and the relat', 'ed walkthroughs, focus specifically on details about the \nruntime layer (Windows Containers). The guidance describes the ways you can deploy Windows \nContainers on Windows Server 2016 (and later versions) VMs and Azure Container Instances. It also \ncovers more advanced PaaS platforms like Azure App Service and orchestrator like Azure Kubernetes \nService. \nMonolithic applications can be Cloud-Optimized \nIt’s important to highlight that monolithic ', 'applications (applications that are not based on \nmicroservices) can be Cloud-Optimized applications. You can build and operate monolithic \napplications that take advantage of the cloud computing model by using a combination of containers, \ncontinuous delivery, and DevOps. If an existing monolithic application is right for your business goals, \nyou can modernize it and make it Cloud-Optimized. \nSimilarly, if monolithic applications can be Cloud-O', 'ptimized applications, other, more complex \narchitectures like N-Tier applications can also be modernized as Cloud-Optimized applications. \n \n16 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nWhat about Cloud-Native applications? \nAlthough Cloud-Native applications are not the main focus of this guide, it’s helpful to have an \nunderstanding of this modernization maturity level, and to distinguish it from Cloud-Optimi', 'zed \napplications. \nFigure 4-3 positions Cloud-Native apps in the application modernization maturity levels: \n \nFigure 4-3. Positioning Cloud-Native applications \nThe Cloud-Native modernization maturity level usually requires new development investments. \nMoving to the Cloud-Native level typically is driven by business need to modernize applications as \nmuch as possible to drastically improve scale in large applications by creating autonomous \nsu', 'bsystems (microservices) that can be deployed and scale independently from other areas of the \napplication while lowering costs in the long term and increase evolution agility of those autonomous \napp’s parts that provide significant compete advantages. \nThe main pillars of Cloud-Native applications are based on microservices architecture approaches, \nwhich can evolve with agility and scale to limits that would be difficult to achieve in a monoli', 'thic \narchitecture, deployed to either on-premises or cloud environment. \nFigure 4-4 shows the main characteristics of the Cloud-Native model. \n \n17 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \n \nFigure 4-4. Cloud-Native characteristics \nIn addition, you can extend basic modern web apps and cloud-native apps by adding other services, \nlike artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and IoT. You might use ', 'any of these services to \nextend any of the possible Cloud-Optimized approaches. \nThe fundamental difference in applications at the Cloud-Native level is in the application architecture. \nCloud-native applications are, by definition, apps that are based on microservices. Cloud-native apps \nrequire special architectures, technologies, and platforms, compared to a monolithic web application \nor traditional N-Tier application. \nCloud-native applicat', 'ions details \nCloud-Native is a more advanced or mature state for large and mission-critical applications. Cloud-\nNative applications usually require architecture and design that are created from scratch instead of by \nmodernizing existing applications. The key difference between a Cloud-Native application and a \nsimpler Cloud-Optimized web app is the recommendation to use microservices architectures in a \ncloud-native approach. Cloud-Optimized a', 'pps can also be monolithic web apps or N-Tier apps. \nThe Twelve-Factor App (a collection of patterns that are closely related to microservices approaches) \nis also considered a requirement for cloud-native application architectures. \nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a primary promoter of cloud-native principles. \nMicrosoft is a member of the CNCF. \nFor detailed guidance on how to design and develop cloud-native applications, read t', 'he following \nfree e-books: \n \n18 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \n• \nArchitecting Cloud-Native .NET Applications for Azure \n• \n.NET Microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications. \nThe most important factor to consider if you migrate a full application to the cloud-native model is \nthat you must rearchitect to a microservices-based architecture. This approach clearly requires a \nsignif', 'icant investment in development because of the large refactoring process involved. This option \nusually is chosen for mission-critical applications that need new levels of scalability and long-term \nagility. But, you could start moving toward cloud-native by adding microservices for just a few new \nscenarios, and eventually refactor the application fully as microservices. This step is an incremental \napproach that is the best option for some scen', 'arios. \nWhat about microservices? \nUnderstanding microservices and how they work is important when you are considering cloud-native \napplications for your organization. \nThe microservices architecture is an advanced approach that you can use for applications that are \ncreated from scratch or when you evolve existing applications toward cloud-native applications. You \ncan start by adding a few microservices to existing applications to learn about ', 'the new microservices \nparadigms. But clearly, you need to architect and code, especially for this type of architectural \napproach. \nHowever, microservices are not mandatory for any new or modern application. Microservices are not a \n“magic bullet,” and they aren’t the single, best way to create every application. How and when you use \nmicroservices depends on the type of application that you need to build. \nThe microservices architecture is beco', 'ming the preferred approach for distributed and large or \ncomplex mission-critical applications that are based on multiple, independent subsystems in the form \nof autonomous services. In a microservices-based architecture, an application is built as a collection of \nservices that can be independently developed, tested, versioned, deployed, and scaled. This approach \ncan include any related, autonomous database per microservice. \nFor a detailed lo', 'ok at a microservices architecture that you can implement by using .NET, see the \ndownloadable PDF e-book .NET microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications. The \nguide also is available online. \nBut even in scenarios in which microservices offer powerful capabilities-independent deployment, \nstrong subsystem boundaries, and technology diversity-they also raise many new challenges. The \nchallenges are related to distributed appl', 'ication development, such as fragmented and independent \ndata models; achieving resilient communication between microservices; the need for eventual \nconsistency; and operational complexity. Microservices introduce a higher level of complexity \ncompared to traditional monolithic applications. \nBecause of the complexity of a microservices architecture, only specific scenarios and certain \napplication types are suitable for microservice-based appli', 'cations. These include large and complex \napplications that have multiple, evolving subsystems. In these cases, it’s worth investing in a more \ncomplex software architecture, for increased long-term agility and more efficient application \nmaintenance. But for less complex scenarios, it might be better to continue with a monolithic \napplication approach or simpler N-Tier approaches. \n \n19 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimize', 'd applications \n \nAs a final note, even at the risk of being repetitive about this concept, you shouldn’t look at using \nmicroservices in your applications as “all-in or nothing at all.” You can extend and evolve existing \nmonolithic applications by adding new, small scenarios based on microservices. You don’t need to \nstart from scratch to start working with a microservices architecture approach. In fact, we recommend \nthat you evolve from using', ' an existing monolithic or N-Tier application by adding new scenarios. \nEventually, you can break down the application into autonomous components or microservices. You \ncan start evolving your monolithic applications in a microservices direction, step by step. \nIn any case, the rest of this present guidance focuses most of all on “no microservices-based apps” \nbecause this guidance is mainly targeting the modernization of existing apps that usual', 'ly have \nmonolithic or N-Tier architectures. \nDeploy existing .NET apps as Windows containers \nDeployments that are based on Windows Containers are applicable to Cloud-Optimized applications \nand Cloud-Native applications. \nHowever, in this guide and especially in the following sections, it mostly focuses on using Windows \nContainers for Cloud-Optimized applications where you don’t need to rearchitect your application. \nWhat are containers? (Linu', 'x or Windows) \nContainers are a way to wrap up an application into its own isolated package. In its container, the \napplication is not affected by applications or processes that exist outside of the container. Everything \nthe application depends on to run successfully as a process is inside the container. Wherever the \ncontainer might move, the requirements of the application will always be met, in terms of direct \ndependencies, because it is bun', 'dled with everything that it needs to run (library dependencies, \nruntimes, and so on). \nThe main characteristic of a container is that it makes the environment the same across different \ndeployments because the container itself comes with all the dependencies it needs. You can debug \nthe application on your machine, and then deploy it to another machine, with the same environment \nguaranteed. \nA container is an instance of a container image. A c', 'ontainer image is a way to package an app or \nservice (like a snapshot), and then deploy it in a reliable and reproducible way. You could say that \nDocker is not only a technology-it’s also a philosophy and a process. \nAs containers daily become more common, they are becoming an industry-wide “unit of deployment.” \nBenefits of containers (Docker Engine on Linux or Windows) \nBuilding applications by using containers-which also might be defined as ', 'lightweight building blocks-\noffers a significant increase in agility for building, shipping, and running any application, across any \ninfrastructure. \nWith containers, you can take any app from development to production with little or no code change, \nthanks to Docker integration across Microsoft developer tools, operating systems, and the cloud. \n \n20 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nWhen you deploy t', 'o plain VMs, you probably already have a method in place for deploying ASP.NET \napps to your VMs. It’s likely, though, that your method involves multiple manual steps or complex \nautomated processes by using a deployment tool like Puppet, or a similar tool. You might need to \nperform tasks like modifying configuration items, copying application content between servers, and \nrunning interactive setup programs based on .msi setups, followed by test', 'ing. All those steps in the \ndeployment add time and risk to deployments. You will get failures whenever a dependency is not \npresent in the target environment. \nIn Windows Containers, the process of packaging applications is fully automated. Windows Containers \nis based on the Docker platform, which offers automatic updates and rollbacks for container \ndeployments. The main improvement you get from using the Docker engine is that you create imag', 'es, \nwhich are like snapshots of your application, with all its dependencies. The images are Docker images \n(a Windows container image, in this case). The images run ASP.NET apps in containers, without going \nback to source code. The container snapshot becomes the unit of deployment. \nMany organizations are containerizing existing monolithic applications for the following reasons: \n• \nRelease agility through improved deployment. Containers offer ', 'a consistent deployment \ncontract between development and operations. When you use containers, you won’t hear \ndevelopers say, “It works on my machine, why not in production?” They can say, “It runs as a \ncontainer, so it will run in production.” The packaged application, with all its dependencies, \ncan be executed in any supported container-based environment. It will run the way it was \nintended to run in all deployment targets (dev, QA, staging', ', production). Containers eliminate \nmost frictions when they move from one stage to the next, which greatly improves \ndeployment, and you can ship faster. \n• \nCost reductions. Containers lead to lower costs, either by the consolidation and removal of \nexisting hardware, or from running applications at a higher density per unit of hardware. \n• \nPortability. Containers are modular and portable. Docker containers are supported on any \nserver operat', 'ing system (Linux and Windows), in any major public cloud (Microsoft Azure, \nAmazon AWS, Google, IBM), and in on-premises and private or hybrid cloud environments. \n• \nControl. Containers offer a flexible and secure environment that’s controlled at the container \nlevel. A container can be secured, isolated, and even limited by setting execution constraint \npolicies on the container. As detailed in the section about Windows Containers, Windows \nSe', 'rver 2016 and Hyper-V containers offer additional enterprise support options. \nSignificant improvements in agility, portability, and control ultimately lead to significant cost \nreductions when you use containers to develop and maintain applications. \nWhat is Docker? \nDocker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications as portable, self-\nsufficient containers that can run in the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a co', 'mpany that \npromotes and evolves this technology. The company works in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and \nWindows vendors, including Microsoft. \n \n21 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \n \nFigure 4-6. Docker deploys containers at all layers of the hybrid cloud \nTo someone familiar with virtual machines, containers might appear to be remarkably similar. A \ncontainer runs an operating system, has a file sy', 'stem, and can be accessed over a network, just like a \nphysical or virtual computer system. However, the technology and concepts behind containers are \nvastly different from virtual machines. From a developer point of view, a container must be treated \nmore like a single process. In fact, a container has a single entry point for one process. \nDocker containers (for simplicity, containers) can run natively on Linux and Windows. When running \nregul', 'ar containers, Windows containers can run only on Windows hosts (a host server or a VM), and \nLinux containers can run only on Linux hosts. However, in recent versions of Windows Server and \nHyper-V containers, a Linux container can also run natively on Windows Server by using the Hyper-V \nisolation technology that currently is available only in Windows Server Containers. \nIn the near future, mixed environments that have both Linux and Windows co', 'ntainers will be possible \nand even common. \nBenefits of Windows Containers for your existing .NET applications \nThe benefits of using Windows Containers are fundamentally the same benefits you get from \ncontainers in general. Using Windows Containers is about greatly improving agility, portability, and \ncontrol. \nExisting .NET applications refer to those applications that were created using the .NET Framework. For \nexample, they might be traditi', 'onal ASP.NET web applications-they don’t use .NET Core or .NET 5+, \nwhich is newer and runs cross-platform on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. \nThe main dependency in the .NET Framework is Windows. It also has secondary dependencies, like IIS, \nand System.Web in traditional ASP.NET. \nA .NET Framework application must run on Windows, period. If you want to containerize existing .NET \nFramework applications and you can’t or don’t want to invest in a migr', 'ation to .NET Core or later(“If it \n \n22 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nworks properly, don’t migrate it”), the only choice you have for containers is to use Windows \nContainers. \nSo, one of the main benefits of Windows Containers is that they offer you a way to modernize your \nexisting .NET Framework applications that are running on Windows-through containerization. \nUltimately, Windows Containers ge', 'ts you the benefits that you are looking for by using containers-\nagility, portability, and better control. \nChoose an OS to target with .NET-based containers \nGiven the diversity of operating systems that are supported by Docker, as well as the differences \nbetween .NET Framework and .NET Core, you should target a specific OS and specific versions based \non the framework you are using. \nFor Windows, you can use Windows Server Core or Windows Nan', 'o Server. These Windows versions \nprovide different characteristics (like IIS versus a self-hosted web server like Kestrel) that might be \nneeded by .NET Framework or .NET applications. \nFor Linux, multiple distros are available and supported in official .NET Docker images (like Debian). \nFigure 4-7 shows OS versions that you can target, depending on the app’s version of the .NET \nFramework. \n \nFigure 4-7. Operating systems to target based on .NE', 'T Framework version \nIn migration scenarios for existing or legacy applications that are based on .NET Framework \napplications, the main dependencies are on Windows and IIS. Your only option is to use Docker \nimages based on Windows Server Core and the .NET Framework. \nWhen you add the image name to your Dockerfile file, you can select the operating system and \nversion by using a tag, as in the following examples for .NET Framework-based Windows ', 'container \nimages: \n \n23 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nTag \nSystem and version \nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/runti\nme:4.x-windowsservercore-20H2 \n.NET Framework 4.x on Windows Server Core \nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspne\nt:4.x-windowsservercore-20H2 \n.NET Framework 4.x with additional ASP.NET \ncustomization, on Windows Server Core \nFor .NET (cross-platform for Linux and Windows), the t', 'ags would look like the following: \nTag \nSystem and version \nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0 \n.NET runtime-only on Linux \nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0-\nnanoserver-ltsc2022 \n.NET runtime-only on Windows Nano Server \nMulti-arch images \nSince 2017, Docker has had a feature called multi-arch images. .NET Docker images can use multi-arch \ntags. Your Dockerfile files no longer need to define the operating system that you are targeting. The', ' \nmulti-arch feature allows a single tag to be used across multiple machine configurations. For instance, \nwith multi-arch, you can use one common tag: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0. If you pull \nthat tag from a Linux container environment, you get the Debian-based image. If you pull that tag \nfrom a Windows container environment, you get the Nano Server-based image. \nFor .NET Framework images, because the traditional .NET Framework suppor', 'ts only Windows, you \ncannot use the multi-arch feature. \nWindows container types \nLike Linux containers, Windows Server containers are managed by using Docker Engine. Unlike Linux \ncontainers, Windows containers include two different container types, or run times-Windows Server \ncontainers and Hyper-V isolation. \nWindows Server containers: Provides application isolation through process and namespace isolation \ntechnology. A Windows Server contai', 'ner shares a kernel with the container host and all containers \nthat are running on the host. These containers do not provide a hostile security boundary and should \nnot be used to isolate untrusted code. Because of the shared kernel space, these containers require \nthe same kernel version and configuration. \nHyper-V isolation: Expands on the isolation provided by Windows Server Containers by running each \ncontainer on a highly optimized VM. In t', 'his configuration, the kernel of the container host is not \nshared with other containers on the same host. These containers are designed for hostile multitenant \nhosting, with the same security assurances of a VM. Because these containers don’t share the kernel \nwith the host or other containers on the host, they can run kernels with different versions and \nconfigurations (with supported versions). For example, all Windows containers on Windows 1', '0 use \nHyper-V isolation to utilize the Windows Server kernel version and configuration. \n \n24 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nRunning a container on Windows with or without Hyper-V isolation is a run-time decision. You might \nchoose to create the container with Hyper-V isolation initially, and at run time, choose to run it as a \nWindows Server container instead. \nAdditional resources \n• \nWindows Conta', 'iners documentation \n  \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/ \n• \nWindows Containers fundamentals \n  \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/ \n• \nInfographic: Microsoft and containers \n  \nhttps://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/Container%20infographic%201.4.17.pdf \nThe container ecosystem in Azure \nIn previous sections, it’s been explained what the benefits of Docker containers are as w', 'ell as details \non the specific container images for .NET applications. All that generic information is fundamental in \norder to develop or containerize an application. However, when thinking about the production \ndeployment environment or even QA and Dev/Test environments, Microsoft Azure provides an open \nand broad variety of choices, a full container ecosystem in the cloud (shown in the diagram below). \nDepending on your specific application’s', ' needs, you should choose one or another Azure product. \n \n25 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \n \nFigure 4-7.5. The container ecosystem in Azure \nFrom the container ecosystem in Azure, the following products supporting containers that are \nconsidered infrastructure: \n• \nAzure Container Instances (ACI) \n• \nAzure Virtual Machines (With container’s support) \n• \nAzure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (With contain', 'er’s support) \nFrom those three, ACI provides a great benefit, which is the fact that you don’t need to maintain the \nunderlying OS, no need for you to upgrade/patch, etc. but ACI still is positioned in the infrastructure \nlevel, as better explained in the upcoming sections of this book. \nThe products in Azure supporting containers that are at the same time positioned more in the PaaS \n(Platform as a Service) level are: \n• \nAzure App Service \n• \n', 'Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS and ACS) \n• \nAzure Batch \nThen, Azure Container Registry is a high scalable container registry hosted in Azure that you can use \nfrom all the previous products when registering and deploying your custom container images. \nIn addition, from your containers, you can consume other managed services in Azure like Azure SQL \nDatabase, Azure Redis cache, Azure Cosmos DB, etc. plus there are third-party solutions/platforms \n', ' \n26 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \navailable in Azure Marketplace like Cloud Foundry and OpenShift where you can also use containers \nwithin Azure. \nIn the next sections, you can explore Microsoft’s recommendations on when to use each of those \nAzure products and solutions specifically when targeting Windows Containers. \nWhen not to deploy to Windows Containers \nSome Windows technologies are not supp', 'orted by Windows Containers. In those cases, you still need \nto migrate to the standards VMs, usually with just Windows and IIS. \nFor more information, see the list of Applications not supported by Windows containers. \nAdditional resources \n• \nVirtual machines and containers in Azure \n  \nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/overview/containers/ \nWhen to deploy Windows Containers in your on-\npremises IaaS VM infrastructure \n• \nYour organization might not b', 'e ready to move to the cloud, or it might not be able to move \nto the cloud for a business reason. But, you can still get the benefits of using Windows \nContainers in your own datacenters. \n• \nYou might have other artifacts that are being used on-premises, and which might slow you \ndown when you try to move to the cloud. For example, security or authentication \ndependencies with on-premises Windows Server Active Directory, or any other on-premise', 's \nasset. \n• \nIf you start using Windows Containers today, you can make a phased migration to the cloud \ntomorrow from a much better position. Windows Containers is becoming a unit of \ndeployment for any cloud, with no lock-in. \nWhen to deploy Windows Containers to Azure VMs \n(IaaS cloud) \nIf your organization is using Azure VMs, even if you are also using Windows Containers, you are still \ndealing with IaaS. That means that dealing with infrastr', 'ucture operations, VM OS patches, and \ninfrastructure complexity for highly scalable applications when you need to deploy to multiple VMs in \na load-balanced infrastructure. The main scenarios for using Windows Containers in an Azure VM are: \n• \nDev/test environment: A VM in the cloud is perfect for development and testing in the \ncloud. You can rapidly create or stop the environment depending on your needs. \n \n27 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing ', '.NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \n• \nSmall and medium scalability needs: In scenarios where you might need just a couple of \nVMs for your production environment, managing a few VMs might be affordable until you \ncan move to more advanced PaaS environments, like orchestrators. \n• \nProduction environment with existing deployment tools: You might be moving from an \non-premises environment in which you have invested in tools to make comple', 'x deployments \nto VMs or bare-metal servers (like Puppet or similar tools). To move to the cloud with minimal \nchanges to production environment deployment procedures, you might continue to use \nthose tools to deploy to Azure VMs. However, you’ll want to use Windows Containers as the \nunit of deployment to improve the deployment experience. \nWhen to deploy Windows Containers to Azure \nContainer Instances (ACI) \nThe main value proposition of Azure', ' Container Instances is that you can right away deploy containers \nto it and you don’t need to maintain that environment, you don’t need to upgrade/patch the \nunderlying operating system or VMs, all that is transparent and you just deploy containers into a \nready-to-use environment. \nThe reasons and scenarios when you would want to use ACI are similar to the main scenarios when \nyou use Azure VMs with containers, so basically, the main scenarios ', 'for using Azure Container \nInstances are: \n• \nDev/Test scenarios \n• \nTask automation \n• \nCI/CD agents \n• \nSmall/scale batch processing \n• \nSimple web apps \nThe simple web apps scenario is a fair scenario for ACI but take into account that since in ACI you can \nonly have a single container instance per container image, you won’t have high availability and only \nhave limited scalability. \nHowever, even when ACI is considered infrastructure because ', 'it just provides single container \ninstances, there is a huge benefit compared to regular Azure VMs with Windows Server. With ACI, you \njust deploy the containers into a self-maintained environment and you just pay for those containers. \nYou don’t need to maintain/update/patch VMs, so it is a much better platform for most scenarios \nwhere you might be using VMs with containers. Using ACI is straight forward, you just deploy a \ncontainer, there’s ', 'no need to create a VM environment you just deploy containers. \nThe main benefits of Azure Container Instances (ACI) are: \n• \nRun containers without managing servers \n• \nIncrease agility with containers on demand \n• \nDeploy containers to the cloud with unprecedented simplicity and speed—with a single \ncommand. \n \n28 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \n• \nSecure applications with hypervisor isolation \nIn sh', 'ort, with ACI you can develop apps fast without managing virtual machines or having to learn \nnew tools. It’s just your application, in a container, running in the cloud. \nWhen to deploy Windows Containers to Azure \nKubernetes Service (AKS) \nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by \noffloading the operational overhead to Azure. You get an open solution that offers portability both for \nyour cont', 'ainers and for your application configuration. You select the size, the number of hosts, and \nthe orchestrator tools. Azure Kubernetes Service handles the infrastructure for you. It also supports \nWindows Server containers alongside Linux containers. For more details on Windows OS support and \nthe feature differences between Windows and Linux, read the FAQ. \nThe main benefits of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) are: \n• \nIdentity and security manage', 'ment \n• \nIntegrated logging and monitoring \n• \nCluster node and pod scaling. \n• \nIngress with HTTP application routing \n• \nAKS supports the Docker image format. For private storage of your Docker images, you can \nintegrate AKS with Azure Container Registry (ACR). \nIf you are already working with open-source orchestrators like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or DC/OS, \nyou don’t need to change your existing management practices to move container workloa', 'ds to the \ncloud. Use the application management tools that you’re already familiar with and connect via the \nstandard API endpoints for the orchestrator of your choice. \nChoosing Azure compute platforms for container-\nbased applications \nAs you have noticed after reading the previous sections, Azure is an open cloud that offers multiple \nchoices. You can use the best fit for your needs, however, it also surfaces questions about what \nproduct/tec', 'hnology you should use for your containerized applications. \nAs a by-default recommendation, the following is the main criteria recommended in this guidance: \n• \nSingle monolithic app: Choose Azure App Service \n• \nN-Tier app: Choose orchestrators such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or App Service if \nyou have a single or a few back-end services \n• \nMicroservices: Choose AKS or Azure Web Apps for Containers \n• \nServerless functions & event hand', 'lers: Choose Azure Functions \n• \nLarge-scale Batch: Choose Azure Batch \n \n29 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nHowever, this recommendation should be taken with a pinch of salt, as the product’s selection will \ndepend on your specific application’s needs and characteristics. Not all applications are the same even \nwhen initially they might look similar types. \nAfter a deeper analysis of the application’s', ' needs, the product selected could be different. But, as a \nstarting point, it is good to have initial guidance from where you can start evaluating and testing \nbased on certain priority. \nAdditional resources \n• \nChoose an Azure compute service for your application \n  \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-\ntree \nBuild resilient services ready for the cloud: Embrace \ntransient failures in the cl', 'oud \nResiliency is the ability to recover from failures and continue to function. Resiliency is not about \navoiding failures, but accepting the fact that failures will occur, and then responding to them in a way \nthat avoids downtime or data loss. The goal of resiliency is to return the application to a fully \nfunctioning state after a failure. \nYour application is ready for the cloud when, at a minimum, it implements a software-based model of \nr', 'esiliency, rather than a hardware-based model. Your cloud application must embrace the partial \nfailures that will certainly occur. Design or partially refactor your application to achieve resiliency with \nexpected partial failures. It should be designed to cope with partial failures, like transient network \noutages and nodes, or VMs crashing in the cloud. Even containers being moved to a different node \nwithin an orchestrator cluster can cause i', 'ntermittent short failures within the application. \nHandling partial failure \nIn a cloud-based application, there’s an ever-present risk of partial failure. For instance, a single \nwebsite instance or a container might fail, or it might be unavailable or unresponsive for a short time. \nOr, a single VM or server might crash. \nBecause clients and services are separate processes, a service might not be able to respond in a timely \nmanner to a client', '’s request. The service might be overloaded and respond slowly to requests, or it \nmight not be accessible for a short time because of network issues. \nFor example, consider a monolithic .NET application that accesses a database in Azure SQL Database. \nIf the Azure SQL database or any other third-party service is unresponsive for a brief time (an Azure \nSQL database might be moved to a different node or server, and be unresponsive for a few secon', 'ds), \nwhen the user tries to do any action, the application might crash and show an exception at the same \nmoment. \n \n30 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \nA similar scenario might occur in an app that consumes HTTP services. The network or the service \nitself might not be available in the cloud during a short, transient failure. \nA resilient application like the one shown in Figure 4-9 should implement t', 'echniques like “retries with \nexponential backoff” to give the application an opportunity to handle transient failures in resources. \nYou also should use “circuit breakers” in your applications. A circuit breaker stops an application from \ntrying to access a resource when it’s actually a long-term failure. By using a circuit breaker, the \napplication avoids provoking a denial of service to itself. \n \nFigure 4-9. Partial failures handled by retrie', 's with exponential backoff \nYou can use these techniques both in HTTP resources and in database resources. In Figure 4-9, the \napplication is based on a 3-tier architecture, so you need these techniques at the services level (HTTP) \nand at the data tier level (TCP). In a monolithic application that uses only a single app tier in addition \nto the database (no additional services or microservices), handling transient failures at the database \nconne', 'ction level might be enough. In that scenario, just a particular configuration of the database \nconnection is required. \nWhen implementing resilient communications that access the database, depending on the version of \n.NET you are using, it can be straightforward (for example, with Entity Framework 6 or later. It’s just a \nmatter of configuring the database connection). Or, you might need to use additional libraries like the \nTransient Fault Han', 'dling Application Block (for earlier versions of .NET), or even implement your own \nlibrary. \nWhen implementing HTTP retries and circuit breakers, the recommendation for .NET is to use the \nPolly library, which targets .NET Standard 1.1 (coverage: .NET Core 1.0, Mono, Xamarin, UWP, WP8.1+) \nand .NET Standard 2.0+ (coverage: .NET Core 2.0+, .NET Core 3.0 and later, Mono, Xamarin and UWP \ntargets). The nuget package also includes direct targets for', ' .NET Framework 4.6.1 and 4.7.2. \nTo learn how to implement strategies for handling partial failures in the cloud, see the following \nreferences. \nAdditional resources \n• \nImplementing resilient communication to handle partial failure \n \n31 \nCHAPTER 3 | Modernize existing .NET apps to Cloud-Optimized applications \n \n  \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-\napplications/partial-failure-strategies \n• \nEn', 'tity Framework connection resiliency and retry logic (version 6 and later) \n  \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/ef/ef6/fundamentals/connection-resiliency/retry-logic \n• \nThe Transient Fault Handling Application Block \n• \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/msp-n-p/hh680934(v=pandp.50) \n• \nPolly library for resilient HTTP communication \n  \nhttps://github.com/App-vNext/Polly \nModernize your apps with monitoring and telemetry \nWhen you run an a', 'pplication in production, it’s critical that you have insights about how your \napplication is performing.

You need rich performance monitoring, powerful alerting, and dashboards to help \nensure that your application is available and performing as expected.

It’s also a service in \nOperations Managem', 'ent Suite (OMS). Log Analytics monitors cloud and on-premises environments \n(OMS for on-premises) to help maintain availability and performance. It collects data generated by \nresources in your cloud and on-premises environments and from other monitoring tools to provide \nanalysis across multiple sources. \nIn relation to Azure infrastructure logs, Log Analytics, as an Azure service, ingests log and metric data \nfrom other Azure services (via Azur', 'e Monitor), Azure VMs, Docker containers, and on-premises or \nother cloud infrastructures. Log Analytics offers flexible log search and out-of-the box analytics on top \nof this data. It provides rich tools that you can use to analyze data across sources, it allows complex \nqueries across all logs, and it can proactively alert based on specified conditions. You can even collect \ncustom data in the central Log Analytics repository, where you can qu', 'ery and visualize it. You can also \ntake advantage of the Log Analytics built-in solutions to immediately gain insights into the security \nand functionality of your infrastructure. \nYou can access Log Analytics through the OMS portal or the Azure portal, which run in any browser, \nand provide you with access to configuration settings and multiple tools to analyze and act on \ncollected data. \nThe Container Monitoring solution in Log Analytics help', 's you view and manage your Docker and \nWindows Container hosts in a single location.

However, it’s likely \nthat any organization might benefit from having some of their applications in the public cloud and \nother applications on-premises. But a mixed environment can lead to excessive complexity in \nenvironm', 'ents due to different platforms and technologies used in public clouds versus on-premises \nenvironments. \nMicrosoft provides the best hybrid cloud solution, one in which you can optimize your existing assets \non-premises and in the public cloud, while you ensure consistency in an Azure hybrid cloud. You can \nmaximize existing skills, and get a flexible, unified approach to building apps that can run in the cloud \nor on-premises, thanks to Azure S', 'tack (on-premises) and Azure (public cloud). \nWhen it comes to security, you can centralize management and security across your hybrid cloud. You \ncan get control over all assets, from your datacenter to the cloud, by providing single sign-on to on-\npremises and cloud apps. You accomplish this functionality by extending Active Directory to a hybrid \ncloud, and by using identity management. \nFinally, you can distribute and analyze data seamlessly,', ' use the same query languages for cloud and \non-premises assets, and apply analytics and deep learning in Azure to enrich your data, regardless of \nits source. \nAzure Stack \nAzure Stack is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you deliver Azure services from your organization’s \ndatacenter.

One application is based on ASP.NET 4.x MVC; the second application is based on ASP.NET \n4.x Web Forms. The third app is a 3-Tier app composed by a client WinForms app and a server-side \nWindows Communication Foundation (WCF) service. \nAll these applications ar', 'e available at the eShopModernizing GitHub repo. \nGoals \nThe main goal of this walkthrough is simply to get familiar with these apps, and with their code and \nconfiguration. You can configure the apps so that they generate and use mock data, without using the \nSQL database, for testing purposes. This optional config is based on dependency injection, in a \ndecoupled way. \nScenario 1: ASP.NET Web apps \nThe figure below shows the simple scenario of ', 'the original legacy ASP.NET web applications. \n \n40 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \n \nFrom a business domain perspective, both apps offer the same catalog management features. \nMembers of the eShop enterprise team would use the app to view and edit the product catalog. \nThe next figure shows the initial app screenshots. \n \nDependencies in ASP.NET 4.x or earlier versions (either for MVC or for Web Forms) means that ', 'these \napplications won’t run on .NET Core unless the code is fully rewritten by using ASP.NET Core MVC. \nScenario 2: WCF service and WinForms client app (3-Tier app) \nThe figure below shows the simple scenario of the original 3-Tier legacy application. \n \n41 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \n \nBenefits \nThe benefits of this walkthrough are simple: Just get familiar with the code and initial apps. \nNext steps \nExplor', 'e this content more in-depth on the GitHub wiki: \n• \nTour on the baseline ASP.NET MVC and Web Forms “legacy” apps \n• \nTour on the baseline WCF service and WinForms (3-Tier) “legacy” app \nWalkthrough 2: Containerize your existing .NET \napplications with Windows Containers \nOverview \nUse Windows Containers to improve deployment of existing .NET applications, like those based on \nMVC, Web Forms, or WCF, to production, development, and test environme', 'nts. \nGoals \nThe goal of this walkthrough is to show you several options for containerizing an existing .NET \nFramework application. You can: \n• \nContainerize your application by using Visual Studio 2022 Tools for Docker (Visual Studio \n2017 or later versions). \n• \nContainerize your application by manually adding a Dockerfile, and then using the Docker CLI. \n• \nContainerize your application by using the Img2Docker tool (an open-source tool from \n', 'Docker). \n \n42 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \nThis walkthrough focuses on the Visual Studio 2022 Tools for Docker approach, but the other two \napproaches are fairly similar in regard to using Dockerfiles. \nScenario 1: Containerized ASP.NET web apps \nFigure below shows the scenario for containerized eShop legacy web apps applications. \n \nScenario 2: Containerized WCF service \nFigure below shows the scenario for a 3', '-Tier app with a containerized WCF service. \n \n43 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \n \nBenefits \nThere are advantages to running your monolithic application in a container. First, you create an image \nfor the application. From that point on, every deployment runs in the same environment. Every \ncontainer uses the same OS version, has the same version of dependencies installed, uses the same \n.NET framework version, an', 'd is built by using the same process. Basically, you control the \ndependencies of your application by using a Docker image. The dependencies travel with the \napplication when you deploy the containers. \nAn additional benefit is that developers can run the application in the consistent environment that’s \nprovided by Windows Containers. Issues that appear only with certain versions can be spotted \nimmediately, instead of surfacing in a staging or ', 'production environment. Differences in development \nenvironments used by members of the development team matter less when applications run in \ncontainers. \nContainerized applications also have a flatter scale-out curve. Containerized apps enable you to have \nmore application and service instances (based on containers) in a VM or physical machine compared \nto regular application deployments per machine. This approach translates to higher density a', 'nd fewer \nrequired resources, especially when you use orchestrators like Kubernetes. \nContainerization, in ideal situations, does not require making any changes to the application code \n(C#). In most scenarios, you just need the Docker deployment metadata files (Dockerfiles and Docker \nCompose files). \nNext steps \nExplore this content more in-depth on the GitHub wiki: \n• \nHow to containerize the .NET Framework web apps with Windows Containers and', ' Docker \n• \nAdding Docker Support to a WCF service \n \n44 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \nWalkthrough 3: Deploy your Windows Containers-\nbased app to Azure VMs \nTechnical walkthrough availability \nThe full technical walkthrough is available in the eShopModernizing GitHub repo wiki: \nhttps://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/06.-Deploying-your-Windows-\nContainers-based-app-into-Azure-VMs-(Including', '-CI-CD) \nOverview \nDeploying to a Docker host on a Windows Server 2016 Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure lets you quickly \nset up development/test/staging environments. It also gives you a common place for testers or \nbusiness users to validate the app. VMs also can be valid Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) production \nenvironments. \nGoals \nThe goal of this walkthrough is to show you the multiple alternatives you have when you deploy \nWindows Conta', 'iners to Azure VMs that are based on Windows Server 2016 or later versions. \nScenarios \nSeveral scenarios are covered in this walkthrough. \n \n45 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \nScenario A: Deploy to an Azure VM from a dev PC through Docker Engine \nconnection \n \nFigure 5-4.

Deploy to an Azure VM from CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps Services \nAzure VMs for Windows Containers \nAzure VMs for Windows Containers are VMs based on Windows Server 2016, Windows 10, or later \nversions, both with Docker Engine set ', 'up. In most cases, Windows Server 2016 is used in the Azure \nVMs. \nAzure currently provides a VM named Windows Server 2016 with Containers. You can use this VM \nto try the new Windows Server Container feature, with either Windows Server Core or Windows Nano \nServer. Container OS images are installed, and then the VM is ready to use with Docker. \nBenefits \nAlthough Windows Containers can be deployed to on-premises Windows Server 2016 VMs, when you', ' \ndeploy to Azure, you get an easier way to get started, with ready-to-use Windows Server Container \nVMs. You also get a common online location that’s accessible to testers, and automatic scalability \nthrough Azure virtual machine scale sets. \nNext steps \nExplore this content more in-depth on the GitHub wiki: \nhttps://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/06.-Deploying-your-Windows-\nContainers-based-app-into-Azure-VMs-(Including-CI', '-CD) \n \n47 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \nWalkthrough 4: Deploy your Windows Containers-\nbased apps to Azure Container Instances (ACI) \nTechnical walkthrough availability \nThe full technical walkthrough is available in the eShopModernizing GitHub repo wiki: \nDeploying the Apps to ACI (Azure Container Instances) \nOverview \nAzure Container Instances (ACI) is the quickest way to have a Containers dev/test/staging \nen', 'vironment where you can deploy single instances of containers. \nGoals \nThis walkthrough shows you the main scenarios when deploying Windows Containers to Azure \nContainer Instances (ACI) and how you can deploy eShopModernizing Apps into ACI. \nScenarios \nThere can be variations about deploying the eShopModernizing apps into ACI such as deploying just \none or all of the apps (MVC app, WebForms app or WCF service). In the following scenario shown \nb', 'elow, you can see the ASP.NET MVC app plus the SQL Server container both of them deployed as \ncontainers into ACI (Azure Container Instances). \n \nBenefits \nAzure Container Instances makes it easy to create and manage Docker containers in Azure, without \nhaving to provision virtual machines or adopt a higher-level service. With ACI, you can directly deploy \na Windows container in Azure and expose it to the internet with a fully qualified domain na', 'me (FQDN) \n \n48 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \nin a matter of seconds (Provided that you have the Windows Container image ready in a Docker \nregistry like Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry). \nConsiderations \nDeploying Windows Containers with either full .NET Framework / ASP.NET or SQL Server into Azure \nContainer Instances (ACI) is not quite as fast as deploying to a regular Docker Host (like a Windows \nServe', 'r 2016 with Windows Containers) because the Docker image has to be downloaded (pulled from \nthe Docker registry) every time and the sizes of the SQL container image (15.1 GB) and the ASP.NET \ncontainer image (13.9 GB) are significantly large, however it is much cheaper than maintaining your \nown docker host (permanently on-line Windows Server 2016 with Windows Containers VM in Azure) \nnot to mention a whole orchestrator like Kubernetes in Azure (', 'AKS) which is, on the other hand, a \ngreat choice for production deployments. \nAs the main conclusion, using Azure Container Instances is a very compelling option for Dev/Test \nscenarios and for CI/CD pipelines. \nNext steps \nExplore this content more in-depth on the GitHub wiki: \nhttps://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/05.-Deploying-the-Apps-to-ACI-\n(Azure-Container-Instances) \nWalkthrough 5: Deploy your Windows Containers-\nb', 'ased apps to Kubernetes in Azure Container \nService \nTechnical walkthrough availability \nThe full technical walkthrough is available in the eShopModernizing GitHub repo wiki: \nhttps://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/04.-How-to-deploy-your-Windows-\nContainers-based-apps-into-Kubernetes-in-Azure-Container-Service-(Including-CI-CD) \nOverview \nAn application that’s based on Windows Containers will quickly need to use platforms, m', 'oving even \nfurther away from IaaS VMs. This approach is needed to easily achieve high scalability and better \nautomated scalability, and for a significant improvement in automated deployments and versioning. \nYou can achieve these goals by using the orchestrator Kubernetes, available in Azure Container \nServices. \n \n49 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \nGoals \nThe goal of this walkthrough is to learn how to deploy a ', 'Windows Container–based application to \nKubernetes (also called K8s) in Azure Container Service. Deploying to Kubernetes from scratch is a \ntwo-step process: \n1. \nDeploy a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Container Service. \n2. \nDeploy the application and related resources to the Kubernetes cluster. \nScenarios \nScenario A: Deploy directly to a Kubernetes cluster from a dev environment \n \nFigure 5-7.

Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster from CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps Services \nBenefits \nThere are many benefits to deploying to a cluster in Kubernetes. The biggest benefit is that you get a \nproduction-ready environment in which you can scale out the appl', 'ication based on the number of \ncontainer instances you want to use (inner-scalability in the existing nodes), and based on the number \nof nodes or VMs in the cluster (global scalability of the cluster). \nAzure Container Service optimizes popular open-source tools and technologies specifically for Azure. \nYou get an open solution that offers portability, both for your containers and for your application \nconfiguration. You select the size, the nu', 'mber of hosts, and the orchestrator tools-Container Service \nhandles everything else. \nWith Kubernetes, developers can progress from thinking about physical and virtual machines, to \nplanning a container-centric infrastructure that facilitates the following capabilities, among others: \n• \nApplications based on multiple containers \n• \nReplicating container instances and horizontal autoscaling \n• \nNaming and discovering (for example, internal DNS) ', '\n• \nBalancing loads \n \n51 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \n• \nRolling updates \n• \nDistributing secrets \n• \nApplication health checks \nNext steps \nExplore this content more in-depth on the GitHub wiki: https://github.com/dotnet-\narchitecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/04.-How-to-deploy-your-Windows-Containers-based-apps-into-\nKubernetes-in-Azure-Container-Service-(Including-CI-CD) \nWalkthrough 6: Deploy your Windows Conta', 'iners-\nbased apps to Azure App Service for Containers \nTechnical walkthrough availability \nThe full technical walkthrough is available in the eShopModernizing GitHub repo wiki: \nhttps://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/Deploy-Windows-Container-to-\nAzure-App-Service \nOverview \nA simple containerized application using Windows Containers can easily be deployed to Azure App \nService for Containers. This approach is the recommended', ' approach for most Windows Container-\nbased applications. \nGoals \nThe goal of this walkthrough is to learn how to deploy a Windows Container–based application to \nAzure App Service for Containers from a registry (Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry). \n \n52 \nCHAPTER 4 | Walkthroughs and technical get started overview \n \nScenario \n \nBenefits \nDeploying to Azure App Service for Containers offers the benefits of containers paired with the PaaS \nbe', 'nefits of Azure App Service. The app service can easily be scaled both vertically and horizontally, \nand can be configured to autoscale to meet changing demands. Updates can be performed with zero \ndowntime and the configuration of continuous deployment from a registry is easily configured as well. \nNext steps \nExplore this content more in-depth on the GitHub wiki: https://github.com/dotnet-\narchitecture/eShopModernizing/wiki/Deploy-Windows-Conta', 'iner-to-Azure-App-Service \n \n53 \nCHAPTER 5 | Conclusions \n \nCHAPTER 5 \nConclusions \n• \nContainer-based solutions ultimately provide cost savings benefits. Containers are a solution \nto deployment problems because they remove the friction caused by an absence of \ndependencies in production environments. By removing those issues, it improves Dev/Test, \nDevOps, and production operations significantly. \n• \nA Docker container is becoming the standard ', 'unit of deployment for any server-based \napplication or service. \n• \nFor production environments, you should use an orchestrator (like Kubernetes) to host \nscalable containers–based applications. \n• \nAzure VMs hosting containers are a fast and simple way to create small Dev/Test \nenvironments in the cloud. \n• \nAzure SQL Database Managed Instance is recommended by default when migrating your \nrelational databases from existing applications to Azur', 'e. \n• \nVisual Studio 2022 and Image2Docker are basic tools for you to start modernizing your \nexisting .NET applications with Windows Containers by accelerating the getting started \nlearning curve. \n• \nWhen placing containerized applications in production you will always create or adopt a \nDevOps culture and DevOps tools for CI/CD pipelines, like Azure DevOps Services or Jenkins. \n• \nMicrosoft Azure provides the most comprehensive and complete en', 'vironment to modernize \nyour existing .NET Framework applications with Windows Containers, cloud infrastructure and \nPaaS services. \n']
