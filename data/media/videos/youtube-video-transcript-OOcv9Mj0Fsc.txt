Have you ever walked out of an interview
thinking it went well only to hear
nothing back? You start secondguessing
everything. Was it the way you answered
that one question? Did you seem too
eager? Maybe too casual. It's
frustrating, especially when you know
you had the experience. But here's
something most people don't realize.
It's not about what you said. It's about
how it was framed and how that framing
subtly shifted the power dynamic in the
room. Because interviews aren't just
about showcasing your skills. They're
about managing perception. They're about
maintaining leverage. If you're not in
control of the narrative, someone else
is. And that's when opportunities start
to slip. After years inside hiring
systems at Google, Lyft, Uber, and Tik
Tok, I've seen smart, capable candidates
lose offers not because they weren't a
fit, but because of small, overlooked
missteps that didn't even realize that
they were making. And that's what this
video is about. So, in this video, I'm
going to walk you through eight
overlooked interview mistakes that
quietly cost you leverage and what to
say instead. These aren't personality
flaws. They're framing issues. And once
you fix the frame, your answers start
working for you, not against you. So,
let's start with the first one. This is
something that a lot of well-meaning
candidates do to build rapport, but it
ends up subtly costing them credibility
before the conversation even begins.
Mistake number one, oversharing personal
information. Now, I know this usually
comes from a really good place. They're
trying to build a connection. You want
to seem open, personable, relatable, but
in interviews, that can quietly
backfire. The moment you start talking
about hobbies, weekend plans, or
personal details, that's when you shift
the frame from professional to personal.
And that shift does three things very
subtly, but immediately. It gives the
interviewer something irrelevant to
judge. It opens the door to unconscious
bias and it raises quiet doubts about
your focus and your boundaries. They
won't tell you. They'll just move on.
Now, this doesn't mean hiding who you
are. It means staying in control of what
they remember because what they remember
is what gets you hired. So, what should
you say instead? If they ask about
hobbies, avoid the lifestyle angle.
Instead, say this. I gravitate towards
strategy and systems. Anything that
helps me reset with clarity. Now, if you
feel like mentioning your family, pause
and pivot to purpose. You can say, "I'm
looking for a long-term role where I can
build, grow, and make meaningful
impact." And if they ask, "Tell me about
yourself." Lead with value, not your
biography. I break that down in a prior
video. Here's the real takeaway. There's
no such thing as neutral in an
interview. Every word either moves you
closer to an offer or it makes it easier
for them to say no. Interviews don't
reward full transparency. They reward
relevance. So say less, say it with
clarity. Say what gets remembered.
Mistake number two, being too honest
about why you're leaving. Maybe your
manager wasn't supportive and maybe you
were underpaid. Maybe the role made you
question your value. I know I've had
issues with managers. And if that's your
reality, you're not wrong to feel it.
But here's the issue. When that's the
story you lead with, it doesn't sound
like growth. It sounds like recovery.
And in an interview, that changes how
you're perceived, often without a word
being said. It raises quiet assumptions
like, "Are they going to bring drama?
Will they be difficult to manage? Is
this a risk?" Even if the interviewer
agrees with you, it doesn't serve your
outcome. Because interviews aren't
really about where you've been. They're
about where you're going and whether
that company can see themselves going
there with you. So here's the shift.
Don't talk about what you're leaving.
Talk about what you're moving toward. So
try saying this. I'm ready to apply my
experience in insert specific skill to
drive measurable impact. Or you could
say, I'm looking for a team with strong
collaboration and leadership I can grow
under. Or you could say, "I'm excited to
take on more complex challenges and
scale my impact." It's still the truth,
just framed for your future. This isn't
about being fake. It's about keeping the
focus on your next chapter because one
unfiltered answer, no matter how valid,
can quietly close doors, especially if
you think the question is harmless. Now,
if this made you rethink how you'd
answer that question, send this to a
friend who's interviewing, too. Most
people don't catch mistakes like this
until it's too late. And if you want to
come back to this later, save this to
your playlist. You're going to want
these examples when it's time to prep.
But let's keep going. This next one
trips people up even more. Mistake
number three, mishandling the where do
you see yourself in 5 years question.
Now, this one seems harmless, but how
you answer it can quietly shape the
entire impression you leave behind. If
you've ever said, "I'm not really sure."
or "Eventually, I'd like to pivot into
something else." Or, "I thought about
starting my own thing." You were being
honest, but without context, those
answers can raise quiet concerns.
Because this question isn't just small
talk. It's a long-term investment test.
What they're really asking is, "Are you
someone that we should develop, or are
you already halfway out the door?" And
vague answers, even well-intentioned
ones, can sound like this. I'm not
staying, which easily turns into, you're
not worth investing in. You don't need a
perfect 5-year plan. You just need to
show that you're present and aligned
with what this role offers. So, here's a
version that can work for you. I want to
deepen my expertise in the space, take
on more responsibility, and grow into
leadership. Ideally, right here. Now,
that one line communicates focus,
ambition, and staying power without
boxing you in. If that still feels like
a stretch, you are not alone. That's why
I help clients build custom responses
that reflect where they could grow
without making promises that they'll
regret. Because here's the truth.
Handled well, this question will help
you build trust. Handled casually, it
creates doubts that you'll never hear
about, but that shape the outcome.
Mistake number four, letting desperation
show. You may think you're coming across
as committed, willing, and flexible, but
desperation doesn't read as dedication.
It reads as risk. If you've ever said,
"I really need this job. I'll take
anything. I can start immediately." It's
understandable, especially if you're
under pressure. But that energy shifts
the dynamic in the room. And here's what
happens. Often without a word, you're
seen as a fallback. It's assumed that
you have no other options. and suddenly
their offer drops lower, slower, and
less seriously. It costs you leverage
before you've even started negotiating.
Here's a stronger way to frame it. You
can say, "I'm excited about the
opportunity and confident I can add
value. I'd be ready to start within x
amount of weeks to ensure a smooth
transition." That one sentence shows
interest without sounding desperate,
signals professionalism and not panic
and keeps you in control of your
timeline. Because here's the truth. The
less you appear to need the job, the
more valuable you will seem. This is one
of the most common blind spots that I
see. Corporate hiring doesn't reward
perfection. It rewards positioning. You
don't need to overhaul who you are. You
need to frame what you bring clearly,
calmly, and through the lens of value.
Mistake number five, revealing your age
without meaning to. You're not saying
your age out loud, but you might be
giving them the math. Maybe you mention
you've been in the field for 30 years,
or reference your graduation date, or
say something like, "This will probably
be my last role." And while you may mean
it as a sign of experience or
commitment, it could shift the
perspective quietly and quickly. The
assumptions are going to sound like
you're too senior, too expensive, or you
won't stay very long or might be out of
touch. It's not fair, but it happens
because once those impressions form,
they're hard to reverse. You won't get a
note about it. You'll just stop hearing
back. And here's the shift. Anchor your
answers in value, not in years. So, try
say something like this. I've led teams
that delivered X result, and I bring
deep experience in Y skill. that
directly aligns with what this role
needs. That reframes your background in
terms of relevance, not age. It focuses
on what you solve right now. You're not
erasing your experience. You're shaping
how it's understood. And when it comes
to interviews, perception often speaks
louder than truth. I'm curious, have you
ever said something in an interview that
felt fine but never heard back? Drop it
in the comments. Let's build a list of
subtle mistakes that no one warns you
about. And if you've ever heard the
advice of just be yourself, share this
video. There's a smarter way to show up.
Mistakes number six and seven, talking
about politics or personal health. Now,
these topics usually come up casually.
Sometimes it's part of a story,
sometimes to build connection. But in
interviews, even small comments about
politics or personal health can shift
how you're perceived without warning.
You might be trying to sound open or
explain a gap in your resume or just be
honest. But here's what tends to happen.
You invite unconscious bias. You shift
attention away from your value and you
create a conversation that you can't
control. Even if it feels harmless in
the moment, you don't know how it's
landing. You don't get to reframe it.
You won't give feedback. You'll just
stop hearing back. So, here's a good
rule of thumb. If it doesn't directly
relate to your ability to do the job,
leave it out. Not everything belongs in
the room, especially if it doesn't serve
your outcome. You're not there to be
fully known. You're there to be clearly
understood for the strengths that you
bring to the table. Because these
conversations aren't just about who you
are, they're about what you can help
them achieve. Mistake number eight,
sharing your salary history. It can feel
like an honest thing to do. Maybe the
interviewer asks directly. Maybe it
seems like standard protocol. So, you
share your past salary. Just trying to
be transparent. But here's the problem.
That number becomes an anchor, not in
your favor. If you are underpaid,
they'll use that to justify a lower
offer. If you were well- paid, they may
use it to cap your growth. Either way,
you've shifted the conversation away
from your worth and toward what someone
else has decided to pay you. Here's a
better move. Instead, say something like
this. I'm targeting a competitive market
range of this range between X to Y
dollar based on my experience and
current industry standards. That one
sentence centers the conversation on
value, not your history. It keeps your
leverage intact and signals quiet
confidence. So listen, you don't have to
justify, you don't need to apologize,
and you certainly don't need to drag old
numbers into new opportunities because
your last paycheck isn't a reflection of
your worth. It's a reflection of what
someone else got away with paying you.
If there's one thing I hope you take
away, it's this. Interviews aren't just
about what you say. They're shaped by
how you frame it. Small shifts in
language can change how you are seen.
Not just as a candidate, but as a
leader, a partner, and a long-term
investment. This isn't about playing a
role. It's about showing up with
clarity, confidence, and quiet strategy.
But here's the other half of the
equation. None of this matters if you're
not getting in the room in the first
place. If your LinkedIn isn't showing up
in searches, if it doesn't clearly
reflect your value, if it's not making
the right first impression, then you're
missing opportunities even before they
start. I've got another video that walks
you through how to fix that step by
step. From how your profile reads to how
you show up in recruiter searches, it's
all connected. So, let's keep going.
