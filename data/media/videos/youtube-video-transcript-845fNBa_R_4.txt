You've seen it before. An entry-level
job asking for 2 years of experience,
three tools, and zero handholding. If
that's entrylevel,
then where exactly are you supposed to
enter? In this video, I'll break down
why entrylevel roles are rarely built
for beginners, how companies offload
training onto you, and what you can do
if you're starting with zero experience.
And let me just give a little disclaimer
disclosure. I'm not advocating for this.
Don't shoot the messenger. I'm just
telling you what I know. So, let's get
started. If you're a new grad career
changer or you're re-entering the
workforce after a break, you don't need
fluff. You need a strategy. Here's what
you're going to be learning today in
this video. Why entry level doesn't mean
beginner, where companies do still
train, and how to get hired with no
experience. The system is broken. Here's
the illusion of entry-level roles. The
first shock most job seekers get. Entry
level doesn't mean what you think. Entry
level sounds like an invitation that
it's your first professional step. But
if you've looked closely at these
listings, you've probably read that they
require 1 to three years of experience,
plus software fluency, industry
familiarity, and ideally prior work
results. But let's be real, what's
labeled as entry level is anything but
beginner friendly. A 2023 report by
Talent Works found that over 60% of
entry-level roles actually require prior
professional experience. You're just
being told, quote, just get your foot in
the door. But even the door handle is
out of reach unless you're already
inside the building. Now, as a
recruiter, I've seen this firsthand.
These roles aren't built for learners.
They're built for plug-andplay hires.
The language is coded entry level, but
it means that you're already trained.
Now, this wasn't always the case. So,
what changed? And why did companies stop
training from within? Here's why
companies don't train anyone anymore.
This used to be different. So, what
happened? For decades, companies grew
talent internally with onboarding,
shadowing, and mentorship. Those were
not perks. They were part of the
process. But that changed fast. Between
2016 and 2022, Deote found that learning
and development budgets dropped by over
20% across major organizations. Internal
development was replaced by external
recruitment. Why train someone when you
can hire someone who's already trained?
The logic sounds simple, right? Training
takes time and time is expensive. So
companies shifted the burden from
themselves to employees. They still want
skilled employees, but now they expect
you to arrive trained, certified, and
job ready. You pay for the learning
upfront before you ever see a paycheck.
This is why you feel stuck. You're not
applying for a job. You're applying to
recover an investment that you were
forced to make a loan. It's not just a
hiring shift. It's a systemic reframe
because companies don't grow talent
anymore. They outsource it. And not just
at the entry level, at every experience
level. When I became a people manager, I
received zero training. They didn't even
give me a book to read. I was promoted
with no onboarding, only with the
expectation to learn on my own, and on
top of that, build out trainings for my
employees that the company didn't
provide. This creates a dangerous
paradox because if experience is the
price of entry, no one will give you
that first chance. So, how do you ever
break in? Here's the catch 22 of
experience. And if you think applying
anyway will work, it won't. One of the
most common questions I hear is, "How do
I get experience if no one will give me
a chance and hire me?" That is the catch
22 of modern hiring, and it's the
default setting for most companies. Over
47% of junior job postings use the
phrase quote hit the ground running
according to LinkedIn jobs insights.
Translation:
We don't have time or budget to train
you. This hits hardest for three groups.
New graduates with no internship
experience, parents returning after a
career break, and career changers who
are trying to pivot into a new field.
You're not underqualified. You're just
invisible to a system that values proof
over potential. And even when you try to
create your own experience through
volunteering, open source work, or side
hustles, companies often ignore it
because it wasn't done inside another
company. So, you're told to build
experience and then you're punished when
you do it outside of the corporate
pipeline. So, if entry-level jobs
require experience and self-made
experience doesn't count, what roles
actually exist for people starting from
scratch? These are the only real no
experience jobs that are left. So, what
jobs actually hire people with no
experience? Very few jobs today are
truly open to beginners, but they do
exist. You just have to know what to
look for. They're not labeled entry
level. In fact, the term entry level
refers to the entry into the corporate
leveling ladder, which I talk about in
my salary negotiation video. These jobs
go by different names, often with
clearer intent. Internships, still one
of the most common on-ramps, especially
for students and recent grads, but
they're competitive and often unpaid or
underpaid. And the experience doesn't
count in the same way as full-time work
because as an intern, you're not
expected to be held to the same
standards as full-time employees because
you're not subjected to performance
reviews to determine if you're meeting
your OKRs. These run throughout the year
and can range from 3 to six month
internships and most of them happen
during the summer. Apprenticeships.
Now, these are growing in fields like
tech, finance, media, and blue collar
fields. They combine paid work with
structured learning and these are
designed for non-traditional candidates
or career switchers. So for example,
when I worked in finance, I had this
experience. Companies hire for
apprenticeship programs. So you're being
paid to study and learn so you can pass
your licensing exams. Once you pass your
exam, your pay goes up and you continue
working as a full-time employee. Trainee
programs. These don't require prior
experience, but they do require learning
agility. Think customer success
associate or sales development rep.
These are very similar to apprenticeship
programs. Returns. These are built for
people who are re-entering after a
career break. Often targeting people who
are caregivers, former entrepreneurs, or
anyone with a resume gap. Companies like
Google and Meta have return programs.

looking for jobs on LinkedIn, type in
these titles and you'll see what comes
up. You may be surprised by what you
find. The through line, these roles
aren't about having the full skill set
upront. They're about potential, your
potential, and they're designed to help
you grow into the role. But don't expect
them to say entry level. That's where
people get tripped up, and rightly so.
No one taught us in school about how
working in corporate works. These
programs are hidden in plain sight. and
are often disguised by corporate jargon
or buried deep in careers pages. So, you
may be thinking, "What about freelance
work or gigs? Doesn't that count as
experience?" Let's talk about that
because the answer isn't what you think.
Here's why freelance and gig work don't
translate. Freelancing isn't always your
golden ticket. And here's why.
Freelancing seems like a logical
workaround. It's flexible, fast, and
often the only way to build experience
when you're shut out of traditional
jobs. But here's the problem. Most
companies still don't treat it as real
experience. Why? Because freelancers are
often seen as temporary, unstructured,
and hard to manage. Hiring managers
worry that you won't adapt to a
full-time culture or that you chose
freelancing because you couldn't land a
corporate role. This is not fair.
Freelancers do build real skills,
execution, client management, problem
solving, but companies default to
familiar markers like logos, job titles,
and full-timelines.
If you've freelanced, there are
workarounds, and you need to reposition
yourself. And here's how you do that.
Frame client work as outcomes, not
tasks. Highlight measurable impact, not
just deliverables. Use testimonials or
LinkedIn endorsements to add external
credibility. Have a portfolio of your
work if you're in a visual field so
people can see it. Don't just say you're
a freelancer. Show what you did, who you
helped, and what changed as a result of
your work. And I've helped my
freelancing clients over the years work
through how to target their job search
by helping them leaprog from freelancing
work to work for companies. So, if gig
work isn't enough and entry level is off
the table, what should you actually
apply for when you're starting from
nothing? Here's what to apply for
instead. Okay, now here's the good
stuff. This is what you came for. So,
what do you apply to when you're
starting from scratch? Here's where most
job seekers go wrong. They apply to more
jobs instead of the right ones. The goal
isn't to get lucky. It's to get your
foot in the door. It's to decode the
roles where companies still train and
position yourself as coachable, not
perfect. Here's where to focus.
Associate or junior titles. These signal
a level below specialist or manager.
Roles like junior data analyst or
marketing associate are more open to
transferable skills. Trainee or
rotational programs especially in tech,
finance and logistics. These are built
to onboard talent and grow you from
inside the company. Customerf facing
entry points. Support rep, client
success, service coordinator. These
roles teach you systems communication
and product knowledge. their internal
launchpads. Startups and early stage
companies, startups care less about
pedigree and more about proof. A
personalized email with a project link
beats a cold resume any day. And here's
the reframe. You're not applying to be
ready. You're applying to be trainable.
Use your resume, your cover letter, and
your LinkedIn to signal that. Show that
you're resourceful, self-taught, and
already learning on your own. Now, what
if you're starting at absolutely
nothing, like zero, negative scratch?
That's exactly what I'm going to cover
next. Here's what to do if you're
starting from zero. And again, you don't
have internships, no formal experience,
no references. Most people stop there.
But the issue isn't experience, it's
evidence. And those are not the same
thing. Recruiters are looking for proof
of potential, not just job titles.
Here's how to build that evidence fast.
Volunteer strategically. So, pick roles
that mirror real job functions. Managing
a nonprofit event, that's project
coordination. Use your volunteer story
to write bullet points that match the
job descriptions that you're aiming for.
If it looks like the job, it counts as
experience. Build a personal project. Do
you want to work in marketing? Run an
Instagram campaign. UX? Redesign an app.
Projects beat platitudes. And here's a
bonus tip. Turn your project into a case
study and publish it on LinkedIn. That
one post can unlock recruiter DMs. Take
a micro credential. Get a free Google
certification or a 2-hour Corsera course
that's related to the type of work you
want to do. Anything that proves
initiative and relevance and that you
have a growth mindset. And don't just
add it to your resume. Share what you've
learned. Employers notice candidates
that show their work, not just list it.
And use LinkedIn as proof of work. Share
what you're learning. Reflect on case
studies. Document your progress
publicly. Treat LinkedIn like your
living resume. Every post is a signal.
And it says, "Here's how I think. Here's
what I know. And I want you to post
before you're ready. You don't need to
be finished. You need to be visible.
Growth beats perfection. And remember,
visibility is credibility. The more you
show up, the more you get seen as
someone who belongs. You're not faking
experience. You're showing your
learning. And in hiring, visibility is
leverage. But here's the real shift, and
it's not just what you do. It's how you
start thinking about your career. That
mindset is everything. And here's how
you can reframe the game to stop waiting
for permission. Here's the moment that
changed everything for me. I had done
everything right. Got my engineering
degree, got a job, and still got laid
off, unemployed, and invisible. And
that's when I realized that hard work
isn't enough. The system doesn't reward
effort. It rewards positioning.
Companies don't hire for potential
anymore. They hire for proof. They hire
people who they know are their people.
And most job seekers are still waiting
to be picked. And here's the truth. You
don't get chosen, you get noticed. When
I became a recruiter, I saw this close
up. The people who got hired weren't
always the best. They were just the most
visible and aligned to what the hiring
manager, the company, and the job
needed. So, your job isn't to be
perfect. It's to be obvious. Prove
yourself enough. Just share enough to be
undeniable. And remember, you are
enough. And in today's market, potential
only matters when it looks like value to
them. So here's the bottom line.
Companies don't build talent anymore.
They buy it. If you're starting from
zero, you're not just behind, you're
invisible. Now you have a strategy.
Search for associate, trainee, graduate
roles, not entry level. Show proof, not
perfection, through targeted projects,
volunteering, or certifications. So,
stop waiting to be picked and start
positioning yourself to be obvious.
