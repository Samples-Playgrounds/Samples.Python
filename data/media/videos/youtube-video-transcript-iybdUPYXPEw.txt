do you ever wonder what recruiters are
thinking about during your job interview
well in this tip I'm going to share
eight secrets and some bonus tips that
recruiters won't share with you but I
will I've spent years working in
recruitment for companies like Google
Lyft Uber Tik Tok and the New York Times
and these Insider tips are going to give
you a huge advantage and no you don't
need any special connections or lots of
experience to use these tips and by the
end of this video you'll understand why
recruiters do what they do which will
help you land your next job offer so
imagine you're walking into a room let's
say you're walking into a party and as
soon as you get there the people in the
room take a look at you up and down and
they make an assessment about you simply
by the way that you look and how you're
dressed it's the same when it comes to
your resume so when you initially apply
to a job that's exactly what a recruiter
is doing they're giving it a quick
glance to determine if you're the kind
of candidate that they want to hire
First Impressions matter a lot and some
of you think well maybe I need to use
one of these fancy resumés where it's
got a head shot and of colors and trust
me you do not need that in fact I have a
video on how to write a professional
resume so if you want something more in
depth go ahead and watch that video but
overall when it comes to writing a
resume hiring managers and recruiters
are looking for RS that clearly
communicate your value to the business
so don't write a resume that's just a
to-do list and you have to make sure
that you don't have any typos that the
formatting is easy to read and it's
simple so make sure you use a format
that is professional if you go into
Google Docs they actually do have a few
templates that you can use which are
pretty standard oh one Insider tip when
it comes to resumés is always have a
single column resume because applicant
tracking systems so an applicant
tracking system is a software tool that
recruiters use to you know to post jobs
externally internally move candidates
through a job interview pipeline it's
basically a tool that makes a
recruiter's job easier and no it's not
filtering out your resume using AI or
Bots I have another video on that too
workday was initially designed to be an
HR software and they basically added on
applicant tracking in the software and
so what a lot of companies do is they
use workday because it's actually free
if they use it for their HR systems so
that's why a lot of companies use it
what you'll notice is that when you
apply to a job using workday if you have
more than one column it actually can't
extract or pull data from your resume if
it's more than one column so single
column use professional fonts don't use
any images if you're applying for a job
in the United States don't include a
head shot every country has its own
rules when it comes to resume writing
but definitely in the US don't have that
this leads me to my next Point as a
recruiter especially when I worked at
Google we would get hundreds if not
thousands of resumés per day and
remember recruiters work on more than
one position we could be working on 10
20 different roles at a time and when
candidates apply to jobs the reason why
we don't spend much time scanning a
resume is because on average and this is
actually statistics based on years of
experience experience on average about
75% of applicants are not qualified at
all for jobs and I know that there are
job Seekers out there that are going to
say well you know if they just gave me a
chance I can do the work but that's not
what hiring managers and recruiters are
looking for they are looking for the
right fit so if you think about it in
terms of a puzzle if we look at a puzzle
there's a specific piece that goes into
the puzzle we're not trying to jam a
piece into the puzzle and like make it
fit they're looking for the right fit so
when they're looking for the right fit
what they're trying to do is they want
someone who is actually qualified that's
why when you read a job description
you'll notice that companies like Google
actually any company that's considered
to be a government contractor or
subcontractor has to follow ofccp
guidelines meaning you have to be 100%
qualified for the basic or minimum
qualifications and if you're not you
can't be considered to be a candidate so
there are people who say well I applied
for this job and I got rejected a few
seconds later well that's because you
weren't qualified for the job and more
than likely what happened was the
recruiter happened to be looking at the
role when you applied and so they did a
quick glance noticed you weren't the
right fit and then they rejected you
that's the other thing with ofccp one of
the rules states that all of the resumés
that applicants use to apply for jobs
must be viewed by human eyes so what you
have to do on your resume is you have to
clearly demonstrate in the resume that
you are the best candidate for the role
there's no interpretive dance when it
comes to job search if the recruiter has
to jump through hoops or Translate
anything that you've written you're not
the right fit for the rule and so when
it comes to the next lesson there are
going to be times where you could have
the perfect resume you're the right fit
but you might not get an interview and
you might not get the job what and
here's why going back to the puzzle
analogy remember when you are putting a
puzzle together there's going to be a
missing piece you may be the piece
that's like almost a fit but the thing
that that is outside of your control
that the recruiter knows and the hiring
manager knows is that recruit recers and
hiring managers understand the
composition of the team and so you have
team members that have you know
strengths and weaknesses and what
they're looking for is a person who's
going to fit within that team and fill
that Gap as best as possible because
let's say there's a member of the
current team who's awesome at what they
do but maybe they lack some of the soft
skills maybe they're not the best
Communicator they're okay but maybe
they're not the best or maybe they lack
some technical skills so what they're
doing is when they're hiring someone new
they want someone who's going to be able
to fill those gaps so when you're in
your interview process and you're asking
questions of the hiring manager and
other interviewers let's say that are on
the team or maybe work alongside the
team you can ask some of those
clarifying questions to determine if you
are or not going to be an exact fit for
what they need now in terms of interview
process here's what's going on with the
next lesson so if you're noticing that
you're in the interview uh process with
a company and you're noticing that hey
wait a minute what's going on like
things have stalled out like why is this
taking a long time well there's a couple
of things one it could be that the
recruiter the hiring manager or the
interviewers maybe on vacation maybe
they're out of the office they're super
busy or the other thing that could be
happening and that other thing is this
so let's say this other candidate comes
through and they are that puzzle piece
based on what the recruiter and the
hiring manager is saying what they'll do
is they will FastTrack that candidate
through an interview process that's why
they may be delaying you because they
think that other person is the perfect
fit so they leap frog that person over
in the process to determine if that
person really is the perfect fit or not
and if they are then they're going to
make a decision on that candidate a lot
faster which again you don't have a lot
of control over that but just know that
if you're being delayed in the interview
process that's probably the reason why
which leads me to again my next lesson
which is the top candidates are going to
get offers really quickly because
recruiters care about how many offers
they extend and how many candidates
accept offers we call them OE OE stands
for offer extend and OA stands for offer
accept those are part of the
measurements of success that recruiters
have and so if I'm working as a
recruiter and I see that there's going
to be a candidate that's going to be
awesome and more than likely they're
probably going to accept this offer I
will make sure that they get through
that process really quickly and every
recruiter does the same thing so what
you have to do as a candidate is make
sure that when you're in the interview
process you're asking good questions of
the recruiter you're asking more about
the role what are the gaps ask the
recruiter what is the hiring manager
looking for when you speak to the hiring
manager ask them what the gaps are in
their team and how you may be a fit
based on what they've learned about you
right so asking good questions in the
interview process will help you as a
candidate when you're actually
interviewing with other interviewers so
that way you can better prepare and
demonstrate your skills in the interview
process so that you can be the right fit
for the job hey if you aren't subscribed
to my channel why aren't you go ahead
and hit like And subscribe because that
really helps out my channel and it lets
me know that you like these kind of
videos when it comes to salary
negotiations you have to understand what
you can be flexible on and what the
company can be flexible on so I have a
video about job offers and I go a lot
more in depth in compensation and how
all of that works but in general um when
it comes to salary negotiations know
that when it comes to the salary itself
we have a band that we're working in and
your interview performance will
determine where you fall within that
band so let's say fall in the middle of
the band because you have an average to
above average performance more than
likely like when you're trying to
negotiate you may not be able to get to
the top of that salary band but you
might be able to negotiate things like
for example um a sign on bonus and the
reason why is because you know and the
hiring manager knows that when you start
working there your ramp up time is going
to be really short as compared to
somebody that they have to onboard and
teach you know the time in which you
begin versus when you're actually ready
to be like full fullon working could be
like 2 weeks to 2 to 3 months so if you
can demonstrate that you can hit the
ground running when you start working
you're saving that company all of this
money two to three months worth of money
you might be able to get a sign on bonus
instead of being able to negotiate your
base salary so work with your recruiter
and ask them you know what's negotiable
and what's not negotiable when it comes
to uh your offers so there is some
flexibility Details Matter a lot
especially at top companies when I
worked at Google I shared a resume with
one of my hiring managers and he caught
a typo that I didn't catch and he said
this person doesn't pay attention to
detail I don't want to hire them and
this was the perfect candidate and I
can't believe I missed the typo but the
hiring manager saw the typo and that
kind of stuff matters and I know that in
this world there are things that you
know we want the world to be certain
ways and we say well that shouldn't
matter you know humans aren't perfect
that's true but first impressions do
matter to these companies and they want
to make sure that you're detail oriented
because if you're not then when you
start working for them let's say you
miss a detail or you get a typo or you
know you miss a number your lack of
paying attention to detail could cost
the company a lot of money and in some
cases depending on the kind of work you
do it can cost people's lives so that's
why it's important to be able to
demonstrate your professionalism the
fact that you do pay attention to
details so the language that you use in
your interviews really matters making
sure you're being polite you're
demonstrating kindness through your
interview process all of those things
really matter so at Google specifically
there's a a terminology called
googliness and googliness is all about
making sure that you are actually a
cultural fit which leads into the next
point so when you are going on your
interview do research on the company
find out more about what type of culture
they have so at Google they have you
know googliness and googliness is all
about being kind caring about your
fellow employees and offering help
whenever possible if you demonstrate
that you have an attitude of like it's
just me on an island you are not going
to get hired there whereas let's say
it's a place like apple now Apple also
has a really open culture but it's open
within their own teams it's not as open
when it comes to working with other
teams so you might actually be sitting
next to someone at work at Apple and you
have no idea what they do because they
have a secretive culture so again
culture really matters and being able to
demonstrate that your cultural fit in
the company is going to give you a lot
of bonus points now when a recruiter
asks you what are your salary
expectations it's not a trick question
it's actually them being genuine here's
why because when a recruiter is asking
what are your salary expectations they
want to have an idea that your
expectations are in alignment with what
they're able to give it's not about not
giving you money I'll give you an
example so if you work at a company
that's let's say a small company and you
want to work for Amazon more than likely
Amazon probably will pay more than the
company you're currently working for
assuming that the small company is just
like a small company it's not a startup
it's not got BC funding right so when
you're interviewing at Amazon let's say
you didn't do your research which
obviously you should if You' watched any
of my videos you know got to do your
research let's say you're in the
situation where the Amazon recruiter is
asking you what are your salary
expectations you can say to them I have
done some research on Amazon
compensation and their philosophy I
would really love to know from you based
on the level of this position what does
an average offer look like for this role
so that's one thing you can say another
thing you can say is well I did do my
research on this position but I don't
know what the salary band is for this
role can you share that with me and then
they'll be able to share with you but
overall just know that when a recruiter
is asking you for your salary
expectations it's a genuine question
it's not a trick question to try to not
give you money if anything hiring
managers if they really like you want to
give you as much money as possible cuz
they know you're the perfect fit and
they'll put their neck on the line to um
extend their budget to make sure that
they bring you in on the team here's a
bonus tip recruiters are professional
matchmakers and what we're doing is
we'll have a candidate's resume and
we'll take a look at it and then based
on the meetings that we've had with the
hiring managers we have what's called an
intake meeting and in the intake meeting
we are intaking what the hiring manager
is looking for and what they need so
we've got the pattern and we've got the
key over here then we've got the
candidates resume and what we're doing
is we're just doing pattern matching to
determine at least on paper does this
person look like they're the right fit
and if they are that's when we will talk
to the candidate to make sure that
they're actually a match so again adding
more of those puzzle pieces together so
that way we can see a fuller picture
recruiters are professional stalkers and
if you want a recruiter to
professionally stalk you check out this
next video and I'll share some awesome
tips that are going to help you out
