This problem cannot be solved via programming as it requires understanding of image context which is not possible for a computer program unless we provide additional information about the image. The prompt "What's this?" expects a human to look at the image and describe what's in it, but a computer program doesn't have the ability to see or understand images without being explicitly taught how to do so by a human.
