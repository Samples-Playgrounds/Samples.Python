**Evaluation Methods Used**

Microsoft uses established industry standards, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, Section 508, and EN 301 549, to guide product evaluation during development and throughout the product lifecycle. Microsoft’s accessibility evaluation assessments incorporate a variety of measures, which can include: (i) conducting automated testing using a variety of proprietary and external tools; (ii) performing inspection and manual testing with a keyboard and adaptive technologies, such as screen readers and speech recognition software; and (iii) testing by individuals with disabilities. Conformance to the accessibility standards documented in this Conformance Report was evaluated according to the [Department of Homeland Security Trusted Tester Program.](https:/www.dhs.gov/trusted-tester)

**Applicable Standards/Guidelines**

This report covers the degree of conformance for the following accessibility standard/guidelines:

| **Standard / Guideline**                 | **Included in Report**                     |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 | Level A: Yes  Level AA: Yes  Level AAA: No |
| Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 | Level A: Yes  Level AA: Yes  Level AAA: No |
| Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 | Level A: Yes  Level AA: Yes  Level AAA: No |

**Terms**

The terms used in the Conformance Level information are defined as follows:

- Supports: The functionality of the product has at least one method that meets the criterion without known defects or meets with equivalent facilitation.
- Partially Supports: Some functionality of the product does not meet the criterion.
- Does Not Support: The majority of product functionality does not meet the criterion.
- Not Applicable: The criterion is not relevant to the product.
- Not Evaluated: The product has not been evaluated against the criterion. This can only be used in WCAG Level AAA.

Note: For criteria marked “Supports,” substantial conformance with the criterion by the product or service has been determined through the Evaluation Testing, which includes a mix of automated and manual testing, as described above.

Note: In the tables below, for all criteria marked “Not Applicable,” the specific feature covered by that criterion is not part of the product. For example:

- If pre-recorded audio-only or video-only content is not part of a product, then WCAG criterion 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) will be marked “Not Applicable.”

**WCAG 2.x Report**

Note: When reporting on conformance with the WCAG 2.x Success Criteria, they are scoped for full pages, complete processes, and accessibility-supported ways of using technology as documented in the [WCAG 2.0 Conformance Requirements](https:/www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20) .
