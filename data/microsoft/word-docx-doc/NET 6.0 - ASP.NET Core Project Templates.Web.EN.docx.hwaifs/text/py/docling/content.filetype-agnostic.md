| #### 11.3.3.4 Error prevention (legal, financial, data)  For software that cause legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true:  1) Reversible: Submissions are reversible.  2) Checked: Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.  3) Confirmed: A mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not Applicable                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| #### 11.5.2.1 Platform accessibility service support for software that provides a user interface  Platform software shall provide a set of documented platform services that enable software that provides a user interface running on the platform software to interoperate with assistive technology.  Platform software should support requirements 11.5.2.5 to 11.5.2.17 except that, where a user interface concept that corresponds to one of the clauses 11.5.2.5 to 11.5.2.17 is not supported within the software environment, these requirements are not applicable. For example, selection attributes from 11.5.2.14 (Modification of focus and selection attributes) may not exist in environments that do not allow selection, which is most commonly associated with copy and paste.                                                                                                                                                                | Not Applicable                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
