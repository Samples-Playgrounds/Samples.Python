**Publish an ASP.NET Core app to Azure with Visual Studio**

Source: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs](https:/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs)

**Important**

**ASP.NET Core preview releases with Azure App Service**

ASP.NET Core preview releases aren't deployed to Azure App Service by default. To host an app that uses an ASP.NET Core preview release, see [**Deploy ASP.NET Core preview release to Azure App Service**](https:/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/azure-apps/index?view=aspnetcore-2.2) .

See [Publish to Azure from Visual Studio for Mac](https:/blog.xamarin.com/publish-azure-visual-studio-mac) if you are working on macOS.

To troubleshoot an App Service deployment issue, see [Troubleshoot ASP.NET Core startup errors on Azure App Service](https:/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/azure-apps/troubleshoot?view=aspnetcore-2.2) .

**Set up**

- Open a [free Azure account](https:/azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet) if you don't have one.

**Create a web app**

In the Visual Studio Start Page, select **File &gt; New &gt; Project...**

Complete the **New Project** dialog:

- In the left pane, select **.NET Core** .
- In the center pane, select **ASP.NET Core Web Application** .
- Select **OK** .

In the **New ASP.NET Core Web Application** dialog:

- Select **Web Application** .
- Select **Change Authentication** .

The **Change Authentication** dialog appears.

- Select **Individual User Accounts** .
- Select **OK** to return to the **New ASP.NET Core Web Application** , then select **OK** again.

Visual Studio creates the solution.

**Run the app**

- Press CTRL+F5 to run the project.
- Test the **About** and **Contact** links.

**Register a user**

- Select **Register** and register a new user. You can use a fictitious email address. When you submit, the page displays the following error:

*"Internal Server Error: A database operation failed while processing the request. SQL exception: Cannot open the database. Applying existing migrations for Application DB context may resolve this issue."*

- Select **Apply Migrations** and, once the page updates, refresh the page.

The app displays the email used to register the new user and a **Log out** link.

**Deploy the app to Azure**

Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select **Publish...** .

In the **Publish** dialog:

- Select **Microsoft Azure App Service** .
- Select the gear icon and then select **Create Profile** .
- Select **Create Profile** .

**Create Azure resources**

The **Create App Service** dialog appears:

- Enter your subscription.
- The **App Name** , **Resource Group** , and **App Service Plan** entry fields are populated. You can keep these names or change them.
- Select the **Services** tab to create a new database.
- Select the green **+** icon to create a new SQL Database
- Select **New...** on the **Configure SQL Database** dialog to create a new database.

The **Configure SQL Server** dialog appears.

- Enter an administrator user name and password, and then select **OK** . You can keep the default **Server Name** .

**Note**

"admin" isn't allowed as the administrator user name.

- Select **OK** .

Visual Studio returns to the **Create App Service** dialog.

- Select **Create** on the **Create App Service** dialog.

Visual Studio creates the Web app and SQL Server on Azure. This step can take a few minutes. For information on the resources created, see [Additional resources](https:/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs?view=aspnetcore-2.2) .

When deployment completes, select **Settings** :

On the **Settings** page of the **Publish** dialog:

- Expand **Databases** and check **Use this connection string at runtime** .
- Expand **Entity Framework Migrations** and check **Apply this migration on publish** .
- Select **Save** . Visual Studio returns to the **Publish** dialog.

Click **Publish** . Visual Studio publishes your app to Azure. When the deployment completes, the app is opened in a browser.

**Test your app in Azure**

- Test the **About** and **Contact** links
- Register a new user

**Update the app**

- Edit the *Pages/About.cshtml* Razor page and change its contents. For example, you can modify the paragraph to say "Hello ASP.NET Core!":

HTMLCopy

@page

@model AboutModel

@{

ViewData["Title"] = "About";

}

&lt;h2&gt;@ViewData["Title"]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;@Model.Message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello ASP.NET Core!&lt;/p&gt;

- Right-click on the project and select **Publish...** again.
- After the app is published, verify the changes you made are available on Azure.

**Clean up**

When you have finished testing the app, go to the [Azure portal](https:/portal.azure.com) and delete the app.

- Select **Resource groups** , then select the resource group you created.
- In the **Resource groups** page, select **Delete** .
- Enter the name of the resource group and select **Delete** . Your app and all other resources created in this tutorial are now deleted from Azure.
