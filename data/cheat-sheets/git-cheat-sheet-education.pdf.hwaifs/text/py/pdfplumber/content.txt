GIT CHEAT SHEET
Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub
related that happens locally on your computer. This cheat sheet features the most important and commonly
used Git commands for easy reference.
INSTALLATION & GUIS STAGE & SNAPSHOT
With platform specific installers for Git, GitHub also provides the Working with snapshots and the Git staging area
ease of staying up-to-date with the latest releases of the command
line tool while providing a graphical user interface for day-to-day git status
interaction, review, and repository synchronization.
show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit
GitHub for Windows
git add [file]
https://windows.github.com
add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)
GitHub for Mac
https://mac.github.com git reset [file]
unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory
For Linux and Solaris platforms, the latest release is available on
the official Git web site. git diff
Git for All Platforms diff of what is changed but not staged
http://git-scm.com
git diff --staged
diff of what is staged but not yet committed
SETUP git commit -m “[descriptive message]”
Configuring user information used across all local repositories
commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot
git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”
set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history
BRANCH & MERGE
git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”
Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes
set an email address that will be associated with each history marker
git branch
git config --global color.ui auto
list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch
set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing
git branch [branch-name]
create a new branch at the current commit
SETUP & INIT git checkout
Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories
switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
git init git merge [branch]
initialize an existing directory as a Git repository merge the specified branch’s history into the current one
git clone [url] git log
retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL show all commits in the current branch’s historyTeach and learn better, together. GitHub is free for students and teach-
ers. Discounts available for other educational uses.
INSPECT & COMPARE SHARE & UPDATE
Examining logs, diffs and object information Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos
git log git remote add [alias] [url]
show the commit history for the currently active branch add a git URL as an alias
git log branchB..branchA git fetch [alias]
show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB fetch down all the branches from that Git remote
git log --follow [file] git merge [alias]/[branch]
show the commits that changed file, even across renames merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date
git diff branchB...branchA git push [alias] [branch]
show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch
git show [SHA] git pull
show any object in Git in human-readable format fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
TRACKING PATH CHANGES REWRITE HISTORY
Versioning file removes and path changes Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history
git rm [file] git rebase [branch]
delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one
git mv [existing-path] [new-path] git reset --hard [commit]
change an existing file path and stage the move clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit
git log --stat -M
show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved TEMPORARY COMMITS
Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches
IGNORING PATTERNS git stash
Preventing unintentional staging or commiting of files
Save modified and staged changes
logs/ git stash list
*.notes
pattern*/ list stack-order of stashed file changes
git stash pop
Save a file with desired patterns as .gitignore with either direct string
matches or wildcard globs. write working from top of stash stack
git config --global core.excludesfile [file] git stash drop
system wide ignore pattern for all local repositories discard the changes from top of stash stack
