GIT CHEAT SHEET

Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub related that happens locally on your computer. This cheat sheet features the most important and commonly used Git commands for easy reference.

INSTALLATION & GUIS With platform speciﬁc installers for Git, GitHub also provides the ease of staying up-to-date with the latest releases of the command line tool while providing a graphical user interface for day-to-day interaction, review, and repository synchronization.

STAGE & SNAPSHOT Working with snapshots and the Git staging area

git status

show modiﬁed ﬁles in working directory, staged for your next commit

GitHub for Windows https://windows.github.com

git add [file]

add a ﬁle as it looks now to your next commit (stage)

GitHub for Mac https://mac.github.com

git reset [file]

For Linux and Solaris platforms, the latest release is available on the oﬃcial Git web site.

unstage a ﬁle while retaining the changes in working directory

git diff

Git for All Platforms http://git-scm.com

diﬀ of what is changed but not staged

git diff --staged

diﬀ of what is staged but not yet committed

SETUP Conﬁguring user information used across all local repositories

git commit -m “[descriptive message]”

commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot

git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”

set a name that is identiﬁable for credit when review version history

git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”

BRANCH & MERGE Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes

set an email address that will be associated with each history marker

git config --global color.ui auto

git branch

set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing

list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch

git branch [branch-name]

create a new branch at the current commit

SETUP & INIT Conﬁguring user information, initializing and cloning repositories

git checkout

switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory

git init

git merge [branch]

initialize an existing directory as a Git repository

merge the speciﬁed branch’s history into the current one

git clone [url]

git log

retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL

show all commits in the current branch’s history

ers. Discounts available for other educational uses.

INSPECT & COMPARE Examining logs, diﬀs and object information

SHARE & UPDATE Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos

git log

git remote add [alias] [url]

show the commit history for the currently active branch

add a git URL as an alias

git log branchB..branchA

git fetch [alias]

show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB

fetch down all the branches from that Git remote

git log --follow [file]

git merge [alias]/[branch]

show the commits that changed ﬁle, even across renames

merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date

git diff branchB...branchA

git push [alias] [branch]

show the diﬀ of what is in branchA that is not in branchB

Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch

git show [SHA]

git pull

show any object in Git in human-readable format

fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch

REWRITE HISTORY Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history

TRACKING PATH CHANGES Versioning ﬁle removes and path changes

git rebase [branch]

git rm [file]

apply any commits of current branch ahead of speciﬁed one

delete the ﬁle from project and stage the removal for commit

git reset --hard [commit]

git mv [existing-path] [new-path]

clear staging area, rewrite working tree from speciﬁed commit

change an existing ﬁle path and stage the move

git log --stat -M

show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved

TEMPORARY COMMITS Temporarily store modiﬁed, tracked ﬁles in order to change branches

git stash

IGNORING PATTERNS Preventing unintentional staging or commiting of ﬁles

Save modiﬁed and staged changes

git stash list

logs/ *.notes pattern*/

list stack-order of stashed ﬁle changes

git stash pop

Save a ﬁle with desired patterns as .gitignore with either direct string matches or wildcard globs.

write working from top of stash stack

git config --global core.excludesfile [file]

git stash drop

system wide ignore pattern for all local repositories

discard the changes from top of stash stack
