|  1 | LEFT JOIN/LEFT OUTER JOIN   | The LEFT JOIN command returns all rows from the left table (first table) and the matching rows from the right table (second table).  | SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;  | SELECT * FROM employees LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;                                                                                                                |
