Running
# gdb <program> [core dump]
Start GDB (with optional core dump).
# gdb --args <program> <args…>
Start GDB and pass arguments
# gdb --pid <pid>
Start GDB and attach to process.
set args <args...>
Set arguments to pass to program to 
be debugged.
run
Run the program to be debugged.
kill
Kill the running program.
Breakpoints
break <where>
Set a new breakpoint.
delete <breakpoint#>
Remove a breakpoint.
clear
Delete all breakpoints.
enable <breakpoint#>
Enable a disabled breakpoint.
disable <breakpoint#>
Disable a breakpoint.
Watchpoints
watch <where>
Set a new watchpoint.
delete/enable/disable <watchpoint#>
Like breakpoints.
<where>
function_name
Break/watch the named function.
line_number
Break/watch the line number in the current source file.
file:line_number
Break/watch the line number in the 
named source file.
Conditions
break/watch <where> if <condition>
Break/watch at the given location if the 
condition is met.
Conditions may be almost any C expression that evaluate to true or false.
condition <breakpoint#> <condition>
Set/change the condition of an existing 
break- or watchpoint.
Examining the stack
backtrace
where
Show call stack.
backtrace full
where full
Show call stack, also print the local variables in each frame.
frame <frame#>
Select the stack frame to operate on.
Stepping
step
Go to next instruction (source line), diving into function.
next
Go to next instruction (source line) but 
donʻt dive into functions.
finish
Continue until the current function returns.
continue
Continue normal execution.
Variables and memory
print/format <what>
Print content of variable/memory location/register.
display/format <what>
Like „print“, but print the information 
after each stepping instruction.
undisplay <display#>
Remove the „display“ with the given 
number.
enable display <display#>
disable display <display#>
En- or disable the „display“ with the given number.
x/nfu <address>
Print memory.
n: How many units to print (default 1).
f: Format character (like „print“).
u: Unit.
Unit is one of:
b: Byte,
h: Half-word (two bytes)
w: Word (four bytes)
g: Giant word (eight bytes)).

a Pointer.
c Read as integer, print as character.
d Integer, signed decimal.
f Floating point number.
o Integer, print as octal.
s Try to treat as C string.
t Integer, print as binary (t = „two“).
u Integer, unsigned decimal.
x Integer, print as hexadecimal.
<what>
expression
Almost any C expression, including 
function calls (must be prefixed with a 
cast to tell GDB the return value type).
file_name::variable_name
Content of the variable defined in the 
named file (static variables).
function::variable_name
Content of the variable defined in the 
named function (if on the stack).
{type}address
Content at address, interpreted as 
being of the C type type.
$register
Content of named register. Interesting 
registers are $esp (stack pointer), $ebp 
(frame pointer) and $eip (instruction 
pointer).
Threads
thread <thread#>
Chose thread to operate on.
Manipulating the program
set var <variable_name>=<value>
Change the content of a variable to the 
given value.
return <expression>
Force the current function to return immediately, passing the given value.
Sources
directory <directory>
Add directory to the list of directories 
that is searched for sources.
list
list <filename>:<function>
list <filename>:<line_number>
list <first>,<last>
Shows the current or given source context. The filename may be omitted. If 
last is omitted the context starting at 
start is printed instead of centered around it.
set listsize <count>
Set how many lines to show in „list“.
Signals
handle <signal> <options>
Set how to handle signles. Options are:
(no)print: (Donʻt) print a message when 
signals occurs.
(no)stop: (Donʻt) stop the program 
when signals occurs.
(no)pass: (Donʻt) pass the signal to the 
program.
Informations
disassemble
disassemble <where>
Disassemble the current function or 
given location.
info args
Print the arguments to the function of 
the current stack frame.
info breakpoints
Print informations about the break- and 
watchpoints.
info display
Print informations about the „displays“.
info locals
Print the local variables in the currently 
selected stack frame.
info sharedlibrary
List loaded shared libraries.
info signals
List all signals and how they are currently handled.
info threads
List all threads.
show directories
Print all directories in which GDB searches for source files.
show listsize
Print how many are shown in the „list“ 
command.
whatis variable_name
Print type of named variable.
