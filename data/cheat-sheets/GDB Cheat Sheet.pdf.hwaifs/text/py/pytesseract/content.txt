# gdb <program> [core dump]
Start GDB (with optional core dump).

# gdb --args <program> <args...>
Start GDB and pass arguments

# gdb --pid <pid>
Start GDB and attach to process.

set args <args...>
Set arguments to pass to program to
be debugged.

Run the program to be debugged.
kill

Kill the running program.

Breakpoints

break <where>
Set a new breakpoint.

delete <breakpoint#>
Remove a breakpoint.

clear
Delete all breakpoints.

enable <breakpoint#>
Enable a disabled breakpoint.

disable <breakpoint#>
Disable a breakpoint.

watch <where>
Set a new watchpoint.

delete/enable/disable <watchpoint#>
Like breakpoints.

function name
Break/watch the named function.

line number
Break/watch the line number in the cur-
rent source file.

file:line number
Break/watch the line number in the
named source file.

break/watch <where> if <condition>
Break/watch at the given location if the
condition is met.
Conditions may be almost any C ex-
pression that evaluate to true or false.

condition <breakpoint#> <condition>
Set/change the condition of an existing
break- or watchpoint.

Examining the stack

backtrace
where
Show call stack.

backtrace full

where full
Show call stack, also print the local va-
riables in each frame.

frame <frame#>
Select the stack frame to operate on.

Stepping

step

Go to next instruction (source line), di-
ving into function.

GDB cheatsheet - page 1

next
Go to next instruction (source line) but
don't dive into functions.

finish
Continue until the current function re-
turns.

continue

Continue normal execution.

Variables and memory

print/format <what>
Print content of variable/memory locati-
on/register.

display/format <what>
Like ,,print“, but print the information
after each stepping instruction.

undisplay <display#>
Remove the ,display* with the given
number.

enable display <display#>

disable display <display#>
En- or disable the ,display“ with the gi-
ven number.

x/nfu <address>
Print memory.
n: How many units to print (default 1).
f: Format character (like ,,print*).
u: Unit.
Unit is one of:
b: Byte,
h: Half-word (two bytes)

w: Word (four bytes)
g: Giant word (eight bytes)).
GDB cheatsheet - page 2

Pointer.

Read as integer, print as character.
Integer, signed decimal.

Floating point number.

Integer, print as octal.

Try to treat as C string.

Integer, print as binary (t= ,,two%).
Integer, unsigned decimal.

Integer, print as hexadecimal.

<what>

~~“ SCr+hHOoHRAA

expression
Almost any C expression, including
function calls (must be prefixed with a
cast to tell GDB the return value type).

file name::variable_ name
Content of the variable defined in the
named file (static variables).

function: : variable name
Content of the variable defined in the
named function (if on the stack).

{type}address
Content at address, interpreted as
being of the C type type.

Sregister
Content of named register. Interesting
registers are $esp (stack pointer), $ebp
(frame pointer) and $eip (instruction
pointer).

thread <thread#>
Chose thread to operate on.

Manipulating the program

set var <variable name>=<value>
Change the content of a variable to the
given value.

return <expression>
Force the current function to return im-
mediately, passing the given value.

directory <directory>
Add directory to the list of directories
that is searched for sources.

list

list <filename>:<function>

list <filename>:<line_number>

list <first>,<last>
Shows the current or given source con-
text. The filename may be omitted. If
last is omitted the context starting at
Start is printed instead of centered a-
round it.

set listsize <count>
Set how many lines to show in ,list*.

handle <signal> <options>
Set how to handle signles. Options are:

(no)print: (Don't) print a message when
signals occurs.

(no)stop: (Don't) stop the program
when signals occurs.

(no)pass: (Don't) pass the signal to the
program.
