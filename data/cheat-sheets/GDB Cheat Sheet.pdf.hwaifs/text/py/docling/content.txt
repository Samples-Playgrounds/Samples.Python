## Running

# gdb &lt;program&gt; [core dump] Start GDB (with optional core dump).

# gdb --args &lt;program&gt; &lt;args…&gt; Start GDB and pass arguments

# gdb --pid &lt;pid&gt; Start GDB and attach to process.

set args &lt;args...&gt; Set arguments to pass to program to be debugged.

run kill

Run the program to be debugged.

Kill the running program.

## Breakpoints

break &lt;where&gt; Set a new breakpoint.

delete &lt;breakpoint#&gt; Remove a breakpoint.

clear

Delete all breakpoints.

enable &lt;breakpoint#&gt; Enable a disabled breakpoint.

disable &lt;breakpoint#&gt;

Disable a breakpoint.

## Watchpoints

watch &lt;where&gt; Set a new watchpoint.

delete/enable/disable &lt;watchpoint#&gt; Like breakpoints.

step

## GDB cheatsheet - page 1

## &lt;where&gt;

function_name Break/watch the named function.

line_number

Break/watch the line number in the current source file.

file:line_number

Break/watch the line number in the named source file.

## Conditions

break/watch &lt;where&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; Break/watch at the given location if the condition is met. Conditions may be almost any C ex- pression that evaluate to true or false.

condition &lt;breakpoint#&gt; &lt;condition&gt; Set/change the condition of an existing break- or watchpoint.

## Examining the stack

backtrace where

Show call stack.

Show call stack, also print the local va- backtrace full where full riables in each frame.

frame &lt;frame#&gt;

Select the stack frame to operate on.

## Stepping

Go to next instruction (source line), diving into function.

© 2007 Marc Haisenko &lt;marc@darkdust.net&gt;

next

Go to next instruction (source line) but don ʻ t dive into functions.

finish

Continue until the current function re- turns.

continue

Continue normal execution.

## Variables and memory

print /format &lt;what&gt;

Print content of variable/memory location/register.

display

/format &lt;what&gt; Like 'print', but print the information after each stepping instruction.

Remove the 'display' with the given undisplay &lt;display#&gt; number.

En- or disable the 'display' with the gi- enable display &lt;display#&gt; disable display &lt;display#&gt; ven number.

x /nfu &lt;address&gt; Print memory. n : How many units to print (default 1). f : Format character (like 'print'). u : Unit.

Unit is one of:

b : Byte, h : Half-word (two bytes) w : Word (four bytes) g : Giant word (eight bytes)).

## Format

| a   | Pointer.                               |
|-----|----------------------------------------|
| c   | Read as integer, print as character.   |
| d   | Integer, signed decimal.               |
| f   | Floating point number.                 |
| o   | Integer, print as octal.               |
| s   | Try to treat as C string.              |
| t   | Integer, print as binary ( t = 'two'). |
| u   | Integer, unsigned decimal.             |
| x   | Integer, print as hexadecimal.         |

## &lt;what&gt;

## expression

Almost any C expression, including function calls (must be prefixed with a cast to tell GDB the return value type).

file_name :: variable_name Content of the variable defined in the named file (static variables).

function :: variable_name Content of the variable defined in the named function (if on the stack).

## {type}address

Content at address , interpreted as being of the C type type .

## $ register

Content of named register. Interesting registers are $esp (stack pointer), $ebp (frame pointer) and $eip (instruction pointer).

## Threads

thread &lt;thread#&gt;

Chose thread to operate on.

## GDB cheatsheet - page 2

## Manipulating the program

set var &lt;variable_name&gt; = &lt;value&gt; Change the content of a variable to the given value.

return

&lt;expression&gt;

Force the current function to return im- mediately, passing the given value.

## Sources

directory &lt;directory&gt;

Add directory to the list of directories that is searched for sources.

list list &lt;filename&gt; :&lt;function&gt;

list &lt;filename&gt; : &lt;line_number&gt;

list &lt;first&gt;,&lt;last&gt;

Shows the current or given source context. The filename may be omitted. If last is omitted the context starting at start is printed instead of centered around it.

set listsize &lt;count&gt;

Set how many lines to show in 'list'.

## Signals

handle &lt;signal&gt; &lt;options&gt; Set how to handle signles. Options are: (no)print : (Don ʻ t) print a message when signals occurs. (no)stop : (Don ʻ t) stop the program when signals occurs. t) pass the signal to the

(no)pass : (Don ʻ program.

## Informations

disassemble

disassemble &lt;where&gt;

Disassemble the current function or given location.

info args

Print the arguments to the function of the current stack frame.

info breakpoints Print informations about the break- and

watchpoints.

info display

Print informations about the 'displays'.

info locals selected stack frame.

Print the local variables in the currently

info sharedlibrary List loaded shared libraries.

info signals List all signals and how they are cur-

rently handled.

info threads List all threads.

show directories

Print all directories in which GDB sear- ches for source files.

show listsize Print how many are shown in the 'list'

command.

whatis

variable_name Print type of named variable.
