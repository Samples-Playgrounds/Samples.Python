CLI Cheat Sheet
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.
The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are
lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently
installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets
the same container that works in the same way.

IMAGES CONTAINERS
Docker images are a lightweight, standalone, executable package A container is a runtime instance of a docker image. A container
of software that includes everything needed to run an application: will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.
code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure
that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between
Build an Image from a Dockerfile development and staging.
docker build -t <image_name> .
Build an Image from a Dockerfile without the cache Create and run a container from an image, with a custom name:
docker build -t <image_name> . –no-cache docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>
List local images Run a container with and publish a container’s port(s) to the host.
docker images docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
Delete an Image Run a container in the background
docker rmi <image_name> docker run -d <image_name>
Remove all unused images Start or stop an existing container:
docker image prune docker start|stop <container_name> (or <container-id>)
Remove a stopped container:
DOCKER HUB docker rm <container_name>
Open a shell inside a running container:
Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing
docker exec -it <container_name> sh
container images with your team. Learn more and find images
Fetch and follow the logs of a container:
at https://hub.docker.com
docker logs -f <container_name>
Login into Docker To inspect a running container:
docker login -u <username> docker inspect <container_name> (or <container_id>)
Publish an image to Docker Hub To list currently running containers:
docker push <username>/<image_name> docker ps
Search Hub for an image List all docker containers (running and stopped):
docker search <image_name> docker ps --all
Pull an image from a Docker Hub View resource usage stats
docker pull <image_name> docker container stats
