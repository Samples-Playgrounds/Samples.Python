Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.
The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are
lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently
installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets
the same container that works in the same way.

## **IMAGES**

Docker images are a lightweight, standalone, executable package
of software that includes everything needed to run an application:
code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.


## **GENERAL COMMANDS**


## **CONTAINERS**

A container is a runtime instance of a docker image. A container
will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.
Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure
that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between
development and staging.














## **DOCKER HUB**

Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing
container images with your team. Learn more and find images
