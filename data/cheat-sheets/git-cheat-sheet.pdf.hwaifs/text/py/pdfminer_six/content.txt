Git Cheat Sheet

01  Git configuration

1

git config --global 
user.name “Your Name”

git config --global 
user.email “you@example.
com”

git config --global 
color.ui auto

02  Starting a project

Set the name that will be attached to your commits and tags.

git rm [file]

Remove file from working directory and staging area.

Set the e-mail address that will be attached to your commits 
and tags.

04  Storing your work

Enable some colorization of Git output.

git stash

git stash pop

Put current changes in your working directory into stash for 
later use.

Apply stored stash content into working directory, and clear 
stash.

git stash drop

Delete a specific stash from all your previous stashes.

git init [project name]

Create  a  new local  repository in the current directory. If 
[project name] is provided, Git will create a new directory 
named [project name] and will initialize a repository inside it.

05  Git branching model

git clone <project url>

Downloads a project with the entire history from the remote 
repository.

git branch [-a]

List all local branches in repository. With -a: show all branches 
(with remote).

03  Day-to-day work

git status

git add [file]

Displays the status of your working directory. Options include 
new, staged, and modified files. It will retrieve branch name, 
current commit identifier, and changes pending commit.

Add a file to the staging area. Use. in place of the full file path 
to add all changed files from the current directory down into 
the directory tree.

git diff [file]

Show changes between working directory and staging area.

git diff --staged [file]

Shows any changes between the staging area and the 
repository.

git checkout -- [file]

Discard changes in working directory. This operation is 
unrecoverable.

git reset -<path>--.]

Revert some paths in the index (or the whole index) to their 
state in HEAD.

git commit

Create a new commit from changes added to the staging area. 
The commit must have a message!                                                       

git branch [branch_name]

Create new branch, referencing the current HEAD.

git rebase [branch_name]

Apply commits of the current working branch and apply them 
to the HEAD of [branch] to make the history of your branch 
more linear.

git checkout [-b]
[branch_name]

Switch working directory to the specified branch. With -b: Git 
will create the specified branch if it does not exist.

git merge [branch_name]

Join specified [branch_name] branch into your current branch 
(the one you are on currently).

git branch -d [branch_
name]

Remove selected branch, if it is already merged into any other. 
-D instead of -d forces deletion.

Commit

a state of the code base

Branch

a reference to a commit; can have a tracked upstream

Tag

a reference (standard) or an object (annotated)

HEAD

a place where your working directory is now

06  Inspect history

09  Synchronizing repositories

git log [-n count]

List commit history of current branch. -n count limits list to last 
n commits.

git fetch [remote]

Fetch changes from the remote, but not update tracking 
branches.

git log --oneline 
--graph --decorate

An overview with reference labels and history graph. One 
commit per line.

git fetch --prune 
[remote]

Delete remote Refs that were removed from the remote 
repository.

git log ref-.

git log -.ref

git reflog

List commits that are present on the current branch and not 
merged into ref. A ref can be a branch name or a tag name.

git pull [remote]

Fetch changes from the remote and merge current branch with 
its upstream.

List commit that are present on ref and not merged into current
branch.

git push [--tags] 
[remote]

Push local changes to the remote. Use --tags to push tags.

List operations (e.g. checkouts or commits) made on local 
repository.

git push -u [remote] 
[branch]

Push local branch to remote repository. Set its copy as an 
upstream.

07  Tagging commits

git tag

List all tags.

10  Git installation

For GNU/Linux distributions, Git should be available in the standard system repository. For 
example, in Debian/Ubuntu please type inthe terminal:

git tag [name]   
[commit sha]

Create a tag reference named name for current commit. Add 
commit sha to tag a specific commit instead of current one.

sudo apt-get install git

git tag -a [name] 
[commit sha]

Create a tag object named name for current commit.

git tag -d [name]

Remove a tag from local repository.

If you need to install Git from source, you can get it from git-scm.com/downloads.

An excellent Git course can be found in the great Pro Git book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. 
The book is available online for free at git-scm.com/book.

08  Reverting changes

git reset [--hard] 
[target reference]

Switches the current branch to the target reference, leaving
a difference as an uncommitted change. When --hard is used,
all changes are discarded. It's easy to lose uncommitted 
changes with --hard. 

git revert [commit sha]

Create a new commit, reverting changes from the specified 
commit. It generates an inversion of changes. 

11  Ignoring files

cat   -<EOF >  .gitignore

/logs-*

!logs/.gitkeep

/tmp

*.swp

EOF

To ignore files, create a .gitignore file in your repository with a line for each pattern. File ignoring will 
work for the current and sub directories where .gitignore file is placed. In this example, all files are 
ignored in the logs directory (excluding the .gitkeep file), whole tmp directory and all files *.swp.
