Git Cheat Sheet 1
01 Git configuration

02 Starting a project
git stash drop Delete a specific stash from all your previous stashes.
Create a new local repository in the current directory. If
git init [project name] [project name] is provided, Git will create a new directory
named [project name] and will initialize a repository inside it. 05 Git branching model
List all local branches in repository. With -a: show all branches
Downloads a project with the entire history from the remote git branch [-a]
git clone <project url> (with remote).
repository.
git branch [branch_name] Create new branch, referencing the current HEAD.
03 Day-to-day work Apply commits of the current working branch and apply them
git rebase [branch_name] to the HEAD of [branch] to make the history of your branch
more linear.
Displays the status of your working directory. Options include
git status new, staged, and modified files. It will retrieve branch name, git checkout [-b] Switch working directory to the specified branch. With -b: Git
current commit identifier, and changes pending commit. [branch_name] will create the specified branch if it does not exist.
Join specified [branch_name] branch into your current branch
Add a file to the staging area. Use. in place of the full file path git merge [branch_name]
(the one you are on currently).
git add [file] to add all changed files from the current directory down into
the directory tree.
git branch -d [branch_ Remove selected branch, if it is already merged into any other.
name] -D instead of -d forces deletion.
git diff [file] Show changes between working directory and staging area.
Shows any changes between the staging area and the
git diff --staged [file]
repository.
Commit a state of the code base

Create a new commit from changes added to the staging area.

07 Tagging commits 10 Git installation
git tag List all tags. For GNU/Linux distributions, Git should be available in the standard system repository. For
example, in Debian/Ubuntu please type inthe terminal:
git tag [name] Create a tag reference named name for current commit. Add
[commit sha] commit sha to tag a specific commit instead of current one. sudo apt-get install git
If you need to install Git from source, you can get it from git-scm.com/downloads.
git tag -a [name]
Create a tag object named name for current commit.
[commit sha] An excellent Git course can be found in the great Pro Git book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.
The book is available online for free at git-scm.com/book.
git tag -d [name] Remove a tag from local repository.
11 Ignoring files
08 Reverting changes cat -<EOF > .gitignore
/logs-*
Switches the current branch to the target reference, leaving
!logs/.gitkeep
git reset [--hard] a difference as an uncommitted change. When --hard is used,
[target reference] all changes are discarded. It's easy to lose uncommitted
/tmp
changes with --hard.
*.swp
Create a new commit, reverting changes from the specified
git revert [commit sha] EOF
commit. It generates an inversion of changes.
To ignore files, create a .gitignore file in your repository with a line for each pattern. File ignoring will
work for the current and sub directories where .gitignore file is placed. In this example, all files are
ignored in the logs directory (excluding the .gitkeep file), whole tmp directory and all files *.swp.
