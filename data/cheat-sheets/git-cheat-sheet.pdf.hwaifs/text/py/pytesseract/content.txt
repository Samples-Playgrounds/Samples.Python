Git Cheat Sheet

01 Git configuration

git config --global

" " Set the name that will be attached to your commits and tags.
user.name “Your Name

Shue SUT 7 efoelbal Set the e-mail address that will be attached to your commits
user.email “you@exampLe.

and tags.

git config --global

. Enable some colorization of Git output.
color.ul auto

O02 Starting a project

Create a new local repository in the current directory. If
[project name] is provided, Git will create a new directory
named [project name] and will initialize a repository inside it.

git init [project name]

Downloads a project with the entire history from the remote

. < g > .
git clone <project url repository.

O03 Day-to-day work

Displays the status of your working directory. Options include
new, staged, and modified files. It will retrieve branch name,
current commit identifier, and changes pending commit.

git status

Add a file to the staging area. Use. in place of the full file path
to add all changed files from the current directory down into
the directory tree.

git add [file]

git diff [file] Show changes between working directory and staging area.

qit diff --staged [file] Shows any changes between the staging area and the
repository.

git checkout -- [file] Discard changes in working directory. This operation is
unrecoverable.

Revert some paths in the index (or the whole index) to their

git reset [<path>...] state in HEAD.

git commit The commit must have a message!

Create anew commit from changes added to the staging area.

GitLab

git rm [file] Remove file from working directory and staging area.

04 Storing your work

it stash Put current changes in your working directory into stash for
J later use.

it stash po Apply stored stash content into working directory, and clear
g Pop stash.

git stash drop Delete a specific stash from all your previous stashes.

05 Git branching model

. List all local branches in repository. With -a: show all branches
git branch [-a] .
(with remote).

git branch [branch_name] Create new branch, referencing the current HEAD.

Apply commits of the current working branch and apply them
git rebase [branch_name] to the HEAD of [branch] to make the history of your branch
more linear.

git checkout [-b]
[branch_name]

Switch working directory to the specified branch. With -b: Git
will create the specified branch if it does not exist.

Join specified [branch_name] branch into your current branch

git merge [hranch=name] (the one you are on currently).

git branch -d [branch_ Remove selected branch, if it is already merged into any other.
name] -D instead of -d forces deletion.

Commit a state of the code base
Branch a reference to a commit; can have a tracked upstream
Tag a reference (standard) or an object (annotated)

HEAD a place where your working directory is now
O06 Inspect history

git log [-n count]

git Log --oneline
--graph --decorate

git log ref..

git log ..ref

git reflog

List commit history of current branch. -n count limits list to last
n commits.

An overview with reference labels and history graph. One
commit per line.

List commits that are present on the current branch and not
merged into ref. Aref can be a branch name or a tag name.

List commit that are present on ref and not merged into current
branch.

List operations (e.g. checkouts or commits) made on local
repository.

07 Tagging commits

git tag

git tag [name]
[commit sha]

git tag -a [name]
[commit sha]

git tag -d [name]

List all tags.

Create a tag reference named name for current commit. Add
commit sha to tag a specific commit instead of current one.

Create a tag object named name for current commit.

Remove a tag from local repository.

O08 Reverting changes

git reset [--hard]
[target reference]

git revert [commit sha]

Switches the current branch to the target reference, leaving
a difference as an uncommitted change. When --hard is used,
all changes are discarded. It's easy to lose uncommitted
changes with --hard.

Create anew commit, reverting changes from the specified
commit. It generates an inversion of changes.

O09 Synchronizing repositories

git fetch [remote]

git fetch --prune
[remote]

git pull [remote]

git push [--tags]
[remote]

git push -u [remote]
[branch]

10 Git installation

Fetch changes from the remote, but not update tracking
branches.

Delete remote Refs that were removed from the remote
repository.

Fetch changes from the remote and merge current branch with
its upstream.

Push local changes to the remote. Use --tags to push tags.

Push local branch to remote repository. Set its copy as an
upstream.

For GNU/Linux distributions, Git should be available in the standard system repository. For
example, in Debian/Ubuntu please type inthe terminal:

sudo apt-get install git

If you need to install Git from source, you can get it from git-scm.com/downloads.

An excellent Git course can be found in the great Pro Git book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.
The book is available online for free at git-scm.com/book.

11 Ignoring files

cat <<EOF > .gitignore

/logs/*
!Logs/.gitkeep
/tmp

*.SWp

EOF

To ignore files, create a .gitignore file in your repository with a line for each pattern. File ignoring will
work for the current and sub directories where .gitignore file is placed. In this example, all files are
ignored in the logs directory (excluding the .gitkeep file), whole tmp directory and all files *.swp.
