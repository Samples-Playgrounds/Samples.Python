--print-out Git Cheat Sheet
Getting Started Move Between Branches Ways to refer to a commit Edit History
Start a new repo: Switch branches: "Undo" the most recent commit (keep your
git init git switch <name> working directory the same):
Every time we say <commit>, you can use any of
git reset HEAD^
Clone an existing repo: OR these:
git clone <url> git checkout <name> Squash the last 5 commits into one:
git rebase -i HEAD~6
Create a branch: ★ a branch main
git switch -c <name> Then change "pick" to "fixup" for any commit you
Prepare to Commit OR ★ a tag v0.1 want to combine with the previous one
Add untracked file or unstaged changes: git checkout -b <name> ★ a commit ID 3e887ab Undo a failed rebase:
git add <file> List branches: ★ a remote branch origin/main git reflog BRANCHNAME
Add all untracked files and unstaged changes: git branch ★ current commit HEAD Then manually find the right commit ID in the
git add . List branches by most recently committed to: ★ 3 commits ago HEAD^^^ or HEAD~3 reflog, then run:
Choose which parts of a file to stage: git branch --sort=-committerdate git reset --hard <commit>
git add -p Change a commit message (or add a file you
Delete a branch:
Move file: git branch -d <name> Discard Your Changes forgot):
git mv <old> <new> Delete unstaged changes to one file: git commit --amend
Force delete a branch:
git restore <file>
Delete file: git branch -D <name>
OR
git rm <file>
git checkout <file> Code Archaeology
Tell Git to forget about a file without deleting it: Look at a branch's history:
git rm --cached <file> Diff Staged/Unstaged Changes Delete all staged and unstaged changes to one git log main
file:
Diff all staged and unstaged changes:
Unstage one file: git restore --staged --worktree <file> git log --graph main
git diff HEAD
git reset <file> OR git log --oneline
Unstage everything: Diff just staged changes: git checkout HEAD <file>
git diff --staged Show every commit that modified a file:
git reset Delete all staged and unstaged changes: git log <file>
Check what you added: Diff just unstaged changes: git reset --hard
git diff Show every commit that modified a file, including
git status Delete untracked files: before it was renamed:
git clean git log --follow <file>
Diff Commits 'Stash' all staged and unstaged changes: Find every commit that added or removed some
Make Commits Show diff between a commit and its parent: git stash text:
Make a commit (and open text editor to write git log -G banana
message): git show <commit>
Show who last changed each line of a file:
git commit Diff two commits:
git blame <file>
Make a commit: git diff <commit> <commit>
git commit -m 'message' Diff one file since a commit:
Commit all unstaged changes: git diff <commit> <file>
git commit -am 'message' Show a summary of a diff:
git diff <commit> --stat
git show <commit> --statBring a branch up to date with another branch
Combine Diverged Branches (aka "fast-forward merge"): Push Your Changes Important Files
Combine with rebase: git switch main Push the Local git config:
git switch banana main .git/config
git merge banana
branch to the remote
git rebase main Global git config:
Before: origin
Before: A B C D E : ~/.gitconfig
A B C main git push origin main List of files to ignore:
.gitignore
Push the current branch to its remote "tracking
main banana branch":
D E banana git push
After:
Push a branch that you've never pushed before:
After: A B C D E main git push -u origin <name>
main banana Force push:
banana git push --force-with-lease
A B C D′ E′ Copy one commit onto the current branch: Push tags:
git push --tags
git cherry-pick <commit>
Before:
D E "lost"
A B C main Pull Changes
Combine with merge: Fetch changes (but don't change any of your
git switch main local branches):
D E git fetch origin main
git merge banana
Fetch changes and then rebase your current
Before:
After: branch:
A B C main git pull --rebase
A B C D′ main
Fetch changes and then merge them into your
current branch:
D E banana git pull origin main
D E
OR
After:
git pull
A B C ◇ main
Restore an Old File
Get the version of a file from another commit: Configure Git
D E banana
git checkout <commit> <file> Set a config option:
OR git config user.name 'Your Name'
Combine with squash merge:
git restore <file> --source <commit> Set option globally:
git switch main
git config --global ...
git merge --squash banana
Add an alias:
git commit Add a Remote
git config alias.st status
Before: git remote add <name> <url>
See all possible config options:
A B C main man git-config
D E banana
After:
D
A B C main
E
D E banana
