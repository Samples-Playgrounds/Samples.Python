    *   ranking (function)

            Given a query q and a collection D of documents that match the query, the problem is to rank, that is, sort, the documents in D according to some criterion so that the "best" results appear early in the result list displayed to the user. Ranking in terms of information retrieval is an important concept in computer science and is used in many different applications such as search engine queries and recommender systems.
            
            A majority of search engines use ranking algorithms to provide users with accurate and relevant results.[4]

    *   tf–idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency, TF*IDF, TFIDF, TF–IDF, or Tf–idf)
    
        *   measure of importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus, adjusted for the fact that some 
            words appear more frequently in general.[1]

        *   refinement over the simple bag-of-words model, by allowing the weight of words to depend on the rest of the 
            corpus.

    *   bag-of-words model
    
        *   models a document as a multiset of words, without word order

*   Standard RAG 

    *   vector search 
    
        *   misses exact keywords (details, product codes or names)

    *   Keyword search
        
        *   ignores semantics

    *   Graph search (Knowledge Graphs)
    
        *   Adding knowledge graphs usually means adding another system and complex syncing

        *   Conversation memory bloats and contexts explode after a few turns.
