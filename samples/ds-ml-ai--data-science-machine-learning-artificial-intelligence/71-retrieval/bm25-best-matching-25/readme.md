        *   widely used ranking function in search engines that scores documents for relevance to a query by considering term frequency (how often keywords appear), inverse document frequency (how rare the words are), and document length, effectively balancing keyword matches with text length for better results than older methods like basic TF-IDF. It's a cornerstone of traditional lexical search, powering systems like Elasticsearch and Solr, and is often combined with semantic search (vector search) for hybrid solutions to get both keyword precision and meaning understanding. How it works Term Frequency (TF): More occurrences of a query term in a document mean higher relevance.Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Rarer words across the entire document collection get a bigger relevance boost.Length Normalization: Penalizes extremely long documents slightly, preventing very long texts with few matches from outranking short, focused ones.Diminishing Returns: Adding more occurrences of a term provides smaller relevance gains after a certain point (e.g., 10 vs. 100 times), preventing saturation. Key characteristics Keyword-based: Focuses on lexical matching of query terms.Effective & Simple: Performs well and is relatively easy to understand and tune.Configurable: Parameters (like \(K_{1}\) for term frequency and \(B\) for length) can be adjusted for tuning relevance. Modern usage Core of Search Engines: Used in Apache Lucene, Elasticsearch, Solr, and databases like PostgreSQL for text search.Hybrid Search: Often fused with semantic (vector) search (using Reciprocal Rank Fusion) to combine keyword precision with conceptual understanding for superior results. What is BM25? - ParadeDBOkapi BM25 is a ranking function used in search engines to score documents by relevance to a query.
