so you're on the phone with the
recruiter and the recruiter asks so what
are your salary
expectations and you're sucked and you
don't know what to say cuz you're
thinking well is this a trick question
because they know how much they can pay
me but I know how much I want to make
but I don't know if they know how much I
want to make so I'm not sure what to do
and you're kind of freaking out then
this video is for you believe it or not
this is not a trick question it is not
meant to stump you it is not meant to
pigeon hole you the reason why
recruiters ask you what are your salary
expectations at the beginning of a job
interview is because they want to assess
a few things now before we get into that
what we need to do first is we need to
take a step back and we need to talk
about how companies determine how much
money they're going to pay you so at the
beginning of the year companies will get
together with Finance they'll look at
headcount they'll look at how much money
people are making they'll look at how
much money they're able to set aside to
hire new employees and promote other uh
like internal employees and what they'll
do is they will set a budget okay so
they're setting a budget over all for
this type of work now what they'll do is
they will take that budget and allocate
that to headcount now we call that
headcount planning now what will happen
is when they're doing headcount planning
they're deciding okay based on the needs
of the company these are the type of
people we need to hire so departments
will basically report up to finance and
say okay I need let's say a marketing
manager on my team or I need a software
engineer on my team who's a mid-level
engineer so they go up to finance they
say okay these are the things that I
need and then Finance goes hm okay well
based on our budget and the allocation
of the budget this is what we can offer
you in terms of headcount so whenever
you talk to hiring managers sometimes
they'll get like really bummed out cu
they say h yeah I only got like three
headcount approved when instead I wanted
five headcount approved cuz they wanted
five employees instead of three now
let's say there's a hiring manager out
there and they need to hire three people
on their team because that's what they
got allocated so the hiring manager goes
okay great so I got three headcount
allocated for this
leveling okay so let's talk about
leveling when it comes to leveling what
we want to do is we want to think about
it like a ladder so on a ladder we have
steps on a ladder also known as rungs so
when we're going up a ladder we're
putting our foot on one rung on the
ladder and then if you want to go up you
have to put your foot on the next rung
on the ladder and so on and so on okay
we call this levels now each rung so
each level on that ladder has we call a
Pay Band or a range for that level when
you're on a level that level has what we
call a Pay Band and that pay band
stretches between a minimum and a
maximum companies rarely will pay above
the maximum level because that could
mean that other people who already work
at the company are not going to be
making that amount of money and that's
going to throw off the company's pay
philosophy so what they do is they try
to keep compensation within that band so
that pay is fair for everybody at that
level when the recruiter is asking you
about your salary expectations what
they're actually doing are two things
number one they want to make sure that
your expectations are actually in
alignment with the payband that they can
pay within so that's number one and then
number two what they're doing is setting
you up so that when you have the offer
conversation with them you already have
an expectation of what the salary band
is and what a possible offer can look
like so this is actually to your benefit
and I'm going to show you how you're
going to use it to your benefit now
remember there's more than just your
salary when it comes to being
compensated for your time understanding
all of the different parts of an offer
will help you negotiate better so let's
talk about the two main parts fixed
compensation and variable compensation
let's start with fixed compensation
fixed compensation is your salary or
your base pay so this is going to be the
regular consistent pay that you get for
your job it's usually an hourly wage or
an annual salary fixed pay is going to
give you that Financial stability that
you're looking for and it's not affected
by your performance or any business
changes and this is the primary base for
your overall pay package now the second
part of your compensation is the
variable compensation portion let's talk
about bonuses bonuses are the extra
money that you get based on your
performance your achievements or any
company's success this can include a
signon bonus performance bonuses
retention bonuses bonuses motivate
employees to to meet or exceed
expectations and can help you
significantly boost your pay
commissions this is super common in
sales jobs because commissions are
payments based on an individual sales
performance a commission structure
usually includes a base salary plus
extra pay as a percentage of sales which
helps motivate employees to reach higher
sales targets and then lastly Equity
also known as stock so Equity pay
includes stock options or restricted
stock units know known as
rsus employees get shares of a company's
stock which can then grow in value over
time Equity it helps align an employees
interest with the company's interests
and their long-term success and if the
company does really well you could do
really really well now here's a bonus
tip now this isn't part of your pay but
it does have an impact on your offers so
when you're speaking with a recruiter
what you want to do is you want to ask
about their benefits p package so for
example when I worked for Tik Tok I
didn't pay anything for my healthc care
benefits which was awesome so if I
didn't have to pay out of pocket for
those benefits that was money that I got
to keep in my pocket but other companies
I've worked at I've had to pay hundreds
of dollars per paycheck just to have
medical dental uh Envision insurance and
that can have an impact on your end
paycheck now that you understand the
components that can go into an offer
let's talk about how you can do some
research now again full disclosure there
is no free website that exists that's
going to tell you exactly what a
company's pay philosophy is going to
look like and what your offer is going
to look like there's always going to be
some Nuance because the websites out
there that are free are relying on other
people to self-report their data but
it's still information that we can use
we just have to take it with a little
bit of a grain of salt so there's some
really great websites like glass store
salary.com level . FYI and the blind app
personally I'm a huge fan of the blind
app the reason why is because it's a
completely anonymous app but in order
for you to actually participate in the
app you need to have a work email so if
you don't that's okay but if you do but
if you do have a work email then you can
use it now let's strategize let's talk
about how you're going to answer the
recruiter when they ask you about what
your salary expectations are the first
first thing you're going to do is you
are going to do your best to redirect
the conversation redirect the
conversation and deflect as much as you
possibly can the reason why you want to
redirect this question is because when
you're in a recruiter phone screen
you're answering a lot of questions that
the recruiter is asking you you don't
really have the chance to ask the
recruiter the hiring manager the
interviewer any questions so you
actually don't have enough information
to be able to tell the recruiter what
your expectations are how would you know
so when the recruiter asks what are your
salary expectations here's something you
can say really appreciate you asking I
did some research online however I
understand that every company's
compensation structure can change over
time and I don't know enough about the
responsibilities of the position to
provide you with a range can you tell me
what a typical offer would look like for
this position again you're not being
rude all you're doing is redirecting the
conversation to allow them to tell you
what that pay band actually looks like
and side note depending on what state
you live in so for example I live in
California if you live in a state like
Colorado or New York most companies have
to disclose their base salary
compensation in their job postings now
strategy number two offer a salary range
this may sound a bit contradictory to
what I said before but I promise you
it's not there are some companies that
when you apply to the job they're going
to ask you in the job posting what are
your salary expectations let's say the
recruiter really insists that you need
to give them a pay range if that's the
case here's something that you can say
based on my research and the roles
requirements I would expect a base
salary in the range of $75,000 to
$100,000 this range reflects my
qualifications experience and
typical market rate for this position
here's how you're going to set a
realistic range take into account your
experience your skills your location and
what the expectations are um of that job
that you're applying for what you want
to do is you want to provide a range
that's not too narrow and not too broad
let's say you did some research and the
range is between $80,000 to $120,000 for
the base pay here's what you can say to
the recruiter given my experience and
expertise I'm looking to make between
between $80,000 to $100,000 in my next
role this range is based on my research
on similar positions my understanding of
the responsibilities and the skills that
I bring to the table I am open to
discussing the entire compensation
package including benefits and growth
opportunities so again what you're doing
is you are telling the recruiter hey I
understand that this job has a pay range
and I'm also telling you that I don't
have enough information to give you a
definitive number I still need
information before I can tell you what I
expect remember when someone asks what
are your salary expectations it is not a
trick question it's a great opportunity
for you to let the company know what it
is that you expect so to recap this is
not a trick question at all and I've
given you some techniques so you can go
in there and Ace this question now if
