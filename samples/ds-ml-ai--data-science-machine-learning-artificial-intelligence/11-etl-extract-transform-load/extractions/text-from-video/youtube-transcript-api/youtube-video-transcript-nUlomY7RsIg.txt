Here's how you can reach more recruiters
with your resume. Well, I have a hack to
help you get past the ATS system. Three
ways to make sure your resume gets past
the ATS, aka the applicant tracking.
Picture this. You're scrolling LinkedIn
and you find a role that feels like a
perfect match. I'm a LinkedIn guy. So,
you tailor your resume. You rewrite your
bullet points and hit submit. 10 minutes
later, automated rejection. No
explanation, no feedback, just silence.
And then it was like crickets. So, you
start asking yourself the usual
questions. Why am I not hearing back? Is
the ATS rejecting me? What's so wrong
with my resume? How do I get interviews
at the companies I actually want to work
for? And naturally, you blame the ATS,
which is the applicant tracking system
that supposedly filters out anyone
without the right keywords in their
resume. But here's the thing, that's not
what's happening. And the longer that
you believe this, the more time you're
going to waste solving the wrong
problem. So, in this video, I'm going to
break down the five biggest ATS myths
that are wasting your time, show you
where these fake metrics, like 80% match
score even come from, and give you the
exact framework that actually gets
résumés noticed. Because the problem
isn't rejection, it's invisibility.
We'll start by explaining how ATS
parsing really works. the actual tech
behind what gets read and what gets
ignored. Then I'll reveal what
recruiters see in ATS's and why most
résumés never even get noticed. And then
next, I'll debunk the five worst rés
myths that are costing you opportunities
and show you how to fix them. And
finally, I'll share a recruiter approved
framework to make sure your resume gets
seen and read. And once you understand
that, everything changes. You're not
going to see guesses in this video.
You're going to see how the system
actually works. And just so you know
where this is coming from, this isn't
just recruiter advice. I've literally
written the kind of software code that
tells machines how to read resumes. Let
me show you how I got there. My dad
spent his career building the early
technology that helped machines read
text off of paper. It's called OCR, also
known as optical character recognition
technology. And it works like this. A
computer scans a document and turns what
it sees into searchable text, like
pulling an address off of a letter or
reading a name off of a resume. One of
his biggest projects was with the US
Postal Service, where his software
actually helped scan and sort millions
of envelopes, packages, newspapers, and
magazines by reading the address and
routing each piece of mail fast and
automatically. And I started learning
about this stuff when I was a kid. And
during college when I majored in
computer science, I actually interned
with my dad at Seammens where I helped
him write some of these algorithms for
machine readable search strings, which
is code that basically tells a system
how to find exactly what it's looking
for in a wall of scanned text. So when I
moved into recruiting, screening over
100,000 résumés at Google, Uber, and Tik
Tok, I wasn't just using these systems.
I understood how they were built and
what they could and couldn't do. That's
why when I see job seekers wasting time
trying to beat the ATS, it's personal
because I know exactly what happens
after you hit submit. And this isn't
theory. It's how the system pulls your
resume apart and what actually makes it
readable to the system and the people
who matter. Now, let's do a gut check
here. If ATS systems really were powered
by AI that automatically rejects
candidates, you'd be getting responses
100% of the time. Do you want to know
what it is? Yes or no. But you're not
getting those responses. Instead, you're
getting silence. That silence isn't
judgment. It's proof that no human even
opened your application. Because if you
keep believing these myths, you'll waste
months tweaking templates, chasing
keywords, and buying the next resume
hack that shows up in your feed.
Meanwhile, your applications are just
sitting there unopened. Not because a
robot rejected you, but because no human
ever saw them. Now, look, the T in ATS
stands for tracking, not terminator.
I'll be back. This isn't some AI
scanning your resume with red glowing
eyes. It's a database that stores files,
lets recruiters post jobs to job boards,
tracks candidates through the interview
process, and helps search through
applications. That's it. Saying you want
to beat the ATS is like saying you want
to beat Excel.
So, you're still not sure what that
actually looks like? Here's what an ATS
system really is. No robots, no AI
overlords, just a glorified spreadsheet
with some filters. Watch this clip from
Samstrom where he walks you through what
recruiters actually see on the back end
of an ATS called Lever. Now, I don't
have access to any ATS systems right now
because I'm not an active recruiter.
However, Sam is and he can show you in
this video. In this video, I'm going to
show you the inside of an applicant
tracking system and address a common lie
that is told to job seekers. In front of
me here is Lever ATS. It's one of the
top ATS's in the tech worlds and my
personal favorite. On the left hand side
here, as you can see, I've selected the
account executive under my open jobs. On
the right hand side is the list of
applicants. And this is typically how
ATS will show applicants. Usually by
date of application. Sometimes it'll be
the most recent or it'll be the oldest
candidate that applied up top. So it's
not about when to apply. Just apply when
you can. Now on the uh candidate side of
things when you apply for a job
externally and you hit apply and when
you upload or attach your resume what
happens is when it says analyzing resume
the applicant tracking system is parsing
for contact information so it can build
and populate a profile in the ATS. What
it is not doing is autorejecting or auto
filtering by keywords. That's not how
applicant tracking systems work. They do
not withhold candidates um from
recruiters despite what sites like job
scan which are just designed to take
your money um say this here. After
scanning your resume, the ATS scores
your resume on a one to 100% scale. A
score of 80% or higher moves you onto a
human recruiter who may contact you.
This is a downright lie. This job site
is trying to take your money. Do not
listen to this advice. Again, applicant
tracking systems don't auto filter and
reject solely based on keywords. If
anyone wants to show me a system via
Loom, that would be great. How it
typically works is when you apply, you
just fall into a pool of applicants. And
as you can see, Sam is now the in the
system here. Yes, some rating systems
exist in applicant tracking systems. But
these are not the default view. And I've
not met a single recruiter who actively
uses these because most of the times
this feature is just a gimmick that
doesn't actually produce results.
Recruiters are screening your resumes.
And once you understand that the real
problem isn't rejection, it's
invisibility.
everything you need to do becomes
crystal clear. So, let's start with myth
number one. The ATS automatically
rejects your resume if you don't have
the right keywords. So, here's the myth.
You apply for a job, you don't hear
back, and you assume that the system
filtered you out because you didn't
include the right keywords. Maybe you
forgot to say crossf functional or
stakeholder alignment. So, the ATS
tosses out your resume into the trash.
It sounds technical. It sounds
plausible, but it's wrong. Here's why
it's wrong. There is no hidden rejection
algorithm scanning your resume for a
checklist. The ATS doesn't ding you for
a missing word, and it doesn't operate
on a scoring system. In fact, it doesn't
reject candidates at all. Applicant
tracking systems store résumés. They
help recruiters manage applications,
post jobs, and if they want, search by
keyword. But most recruiters don't use
those filters. They're clunky. They're
outdated and often surface the wrong
candidates entirely. So, if you didn't
get a call back, it's not because you
missed a phrase. It's because your
resume didn't make your value
immediately clear, if anyone read it at
all. By the way, I'm sure some of you
go, "Well, Farah, see, it does have the
capability to actually filter you out."
Listen, all it is is CtrlF, like find on
your keyboard. That's the functionality.
It's pretty much it. Here's what it
means for you. Chasing keywords is like
writing for a robot that's not even in
the room. Dear
Mr.
Royal
Hampton, you dilute your message trying
to impress a system that is not
filtering you out and in the process you
end up burying the parts of your
experience that actually make you
competitive. So here's what you should
do instead. Don't optimize for density.
Optimize for clarity. Use the job title
and core skills from the posting and
embed them naturally into your
achievements and your bullet points.
Don't just say project management.
Instead, you can say led a cross
functional team of eight plus delivering
new product features 2 weeks ahead of
schedule because you're not trying to
game a system. You're trying to stop a
human from scrolling. Myth number two,
you need an ATS compliant resume. The
myth. RSé scoring tools claim to tell
you how ATS compliant your resume is.
They assign a percentage like 67% 82%
93% and make it feel like you're just
one adjustment away from getting through
the system. But here's the truth. Those
scores aren't based on anything real.
Here's why it's wrong. They're not
coming from an ATS. Those numbers are
not coming from an ATS at all. They're
not used by recruiters. They're created
by third-party companies like JobCan who
are trying to sell resumeé audits. These
tools invented a metric, attach it to
your resume, and frame it as a barrier
so they can sell you their solution.
Once you believe that that score
matters, you stop writing your resume
for people and you start rewriting it
for some fake algorithm, which ends up
watering down your strengths. So, you
start chasing match percentages instead
of leading with what makes you hirable.
And the worst part, no one on the hiring
team will ever see that number. Here's
what it means for you. Optimizing your
resume for a fake score doesn't just
waste your time, it makes your resume
worse. You start removing the parts that
make you credible. All in the name of
chasing a number that never even
mattered. You don't need a higher score.
You need a clearer message. Here's what
to do instead. Again, there is no such
thing as an ATS compliant resume. What
you need is a reader compliant resume.
Something that a human can skim in 5
seconds and immediately understand why
you're qualified. And all you need is a
clean layout. Stick to standard fonts.
Avoid templates with graphics or
gimmicks. and make sure that your
strongest achievements show up where the
eye lands first because clarity gets
interviews. Scores don't. If you're
finding this video helpful, feel free to
subscribe. Myth number three, the white
font trick works. Oh god. So, here's the
myth. This is the zombie of ré advice.
And no matter how many times it gets
debunked, it keeps coming back. The idea
is this. If you hide the job description
or keywords in white font at the bottom
of your resume, the ATS will scan and
see them, but human recruiters won't.
So, it gets pitched as this like clever
workaround. But it's not clever and it
doesn't work. Here's why it's wrong. As
a recruiter, I've seen what happens when
someone tries this. So you submit your
resume, it goes into the ATS and
everything, including the white font
gets extracted into plain text. That
invisible block of key words are now
part of your application record. If a
recruiter copies and pastes your resume
to send it to a hiring manager, that
hidden section shows up in full. And in
that moment, you've gone from being a
potential fit to someone who's trying to
game the system. Also, don't write words
like hire me in white font thinking that
a recruiter is putting your resume into
chat GBT asking if it should hire you.
That is silly. That is ridiculous. But
sadly, thanks to people on platforms
like Tik Tok who are just chasing views,
this has become a problem. Here's what
it means for you. Now, you think you're
improving your odds, but what you're
really doing is signaling that you don't
trust your own experience to speak for
itself. The white font trick doesn't
make you look techsavvy. It makes you
look insecure and a risk. Here's what to
do instead. If the job calls for a
specific skill, don't hide it, highlight
it. Instead of burying the phrase data
analysis 10 times in invisible text,
write a line that shows that you've done
it. So, for example, you could say,
"Perform data analysis on customer
retention leading to a 15% increase in
engagement." That's how you show
alignment and that's how you get
noticed. Not by tricking a system, but
by making your fit undeniable. Myth
number four. ATS systems use AI to
screen candidates. Here's the myth.
There is a super persistent belief that
modern ATS platforms use AI to
automatically evaluate and reject
candidates. That the system somehow
scans your resume, scores it, ranks you,
and filters you out before a human ever
gets involved. It sounds high-tech. It
sounds efficient. But that is not how
hiring works. Here's why it's wrong.
Most ATS platforms aren't powered by
advanced AI. They're old legacy systems
that are like 20, 30 years old, and
they're basically patched together with
like duct tape. They were built to
track, not to judge. You can't plug
machine learning into a 20-year-old
workflow and expect it to make hiring
decisions. And legally, companies are
not allowed to use AI in that way. Not
without running into some serious
compliance issues. Right now, there are
lawsuits against platforms that are
suspected of doing exactly that. No.
God, please. No. No. The risk is too
high. The systems aren't that smart. And
recruiters aren't outsourcing judgment
to an algorithm. Here's what it means
for you. If you're spending hours trying
to beat the AI, you're solving for a
problem that doesn't exist. There's no
machine making hiring decisions. But
there is a recruiter that's skimming
your resume in real time under pressure
and deciding in seconds whether to keep
reading or to reject you. So here's what
you should do instead. Write for a
person, not a platform. That means
structuring your resume so a human can
immediately grasp your relevance and
results. Lead with impact. Use language
that's easy to skim. Make it obvious
where you've made a difference because
no one's scanning for perfection, but
they are scanning for clarity. Myth
number five, getting rejected means the
system filtered you out. Here's the
myth. You apply, you hear nothing, and
you assume the ATS rejected you. That
some hidden algorithm scanned your
resume, decided you weren't qualified,
and filtered you out before a human even
looked. This is chocolate. Chocolate was
my dad's cat and when he gets mosquito
bites on his nose and gets a little
inflamed and we love him. He's the best
kitty in the world. And now back to your
regularly scheduled program. It feels
like there's this invisible wall between
you and a job and that's not what's
happening. Here's why it's wrong. This
belief that some system filtered you out
automatically is one of the biggest
distractions in the entire job search
process. And here's the truth. Even if
that kind of filtering existed, it
wouldn't solve your actual problem.
Because the real issue here is volume.
Hundreds and thousands of people apply
to jobs every day. Many are qualified
and a lot more are unqualified. So even
if you optimize your resume perfectly
for some imaginary score, you're just
landing in a bigger pile of other people
who did the same thing. Now, let me try
to frame this differently. People talk
about hacking the YouTube algorithm in
the same way. It's as if there's some
secret formula that you can unlock to go
viral, but anyone who's created content
seriously knows the truth. The algorithm
is the audience. Same with your resume.
There's no secret algorithm scoring your
application. The algorithm is the
recruiter. The algorithm is the hiring
manager, the actual humans viewing your
resume. And if they don't immediately
see something that makes them stop
scrolling, you're gone. It's also worth
stating that most people don't know, but
federal rules like OFCCP and EEOC
explicitly prohibit using automated
tools to make hiring decisions. Every
resume is supposed to be reviewed by
human eyes. That's not optional and it's
required by law. So, this idea of AI or
bots rejecting you before anyone reads
your resume, it's not just wrong, it's
impossible. Here's what it means for
you. You're not getting filtered out by
a robot. You're just getting overlooked
by a person who has too many resumes and
too little time. If you want to get
picked, stop worrying about systems and
start thinking about story selling your
skills and when you apply to jobs.
Timing is much more important. Here's
what to do instead. Optimize for
attention, not for software. Make your
value clear in the first few lines by
leading with results. Use formatting
that supports quick scanning, not
keyword stuffing. Because your resume
isn't being judged by a system, it's
being skimmed by a human. And humans
don't respond to scores. They respond to
clarity. Now, let's talk about what
actually works. So, let's set aside the
algorithm myths. Okay, we talked enough
about them. Because once your resume is
submitted, the real question isn't did
the system understand it. It's did a
human care enough to keep reading.
That's the game. Not automation, not
trickery. Clarity. Here's what
successful candidates actually do
consistently. One, they write for the
reader, not the system. Recruiters skim
fast. They're juggling multiple roles,
hundreds of résumés, and tight
deadlines. If your resume opens with a
dense block of text, or generic job
duties, you've already made their job
harder. The resume that gets noticed are
scannable and are instantly clear. They
don't bury the good stuff. Instead, they
lead with it. Here's what to do. Make
your most recent job title immediately
obvious. That way, you frontload your
best accomplishments. Use a layout that
works on any screen. Number two, they
show business impact, not job activity.
If your bullet points sound like a job
description, like managed weekly
standups or oversaw internal comms,
you're describing your job duties. What
recruiters want to see is momentum,
impact. What changed because you were
there? Here's what to do. Highlight
outcomes with specific numbers like
reduce churn by 14%, cut onboarding time
by 3 weeks, increase pipeline
conversions by 22%. These are the
results that tell a story that moves the
reader forward. Number three, they
bridge the title gap before someone
disqualifies them. Here's what most
people miss. If your current title
doesn't match the role you're applying
for, even if your experience is perfect,
you may get skipped. Not because you're
unqualified, but because your title
doesn't translate. Here's what to do
instead. Add context. Use parenthesis
and add a clarifier. Lead with a oneline
summary that connects the dots, like
product manager open parenthesis.
Functionally leading road map without
formal title close parenthesis. If they
can't see your fit within a few seconds,
they're not going to keep reading. So,
the bottom line here is instead of
asking, "Did I get enough keywords?"
Start by asking, "Does this make sense
to a human if they're skimming it in 5
seconds?" Because the recruiter isn't
your enemy. The ATS isn't your
gatekeeper. Your real challenge is
simple. Get seen, get read, and get
remembered. And that starts with
clarity. One other bonus tip that I want
to point out to you is this. Some people
will say, "Well, Farah, within a few
seconds, I'm getting rejected by the
applicant tracking system." And that
might be true, but it's not because the
applicant tracking system is using any
type of automation to reject you.
Instead, what usually is happening is
when you apply to a job, they may ask
you a couple of questions to determine
whether or not you're somebody that they
want to hire. Some of those questions
could be, are you over 18 years of age?
Do you require sponsorship, like visa
sponsorship? Some companies don't
sponsor visas, and some companies have
an age limit of who they're able to
hire. We call those knockout questions.
So, knockout questions are the ones that
can automatically reject you. But those
questions were set up by the recruiter
in order to filter people out at the
very beginning. But that's not the core
of what those applications and what
those systems are uh are designed to do.
So if you've been wondering why your
applications go silent, why you're not
hearing back, or what's wrong with your
resume, it's not because of some hidden
algorithm. It's because you were solving
the wrong problem. Now that you know how
these systems actually work, you can
stop optimizing for filters that don't
exist and start focusing on what does.
writing a resume that makes your value
from a business perspective clear to the
people who make the decisions. Because
when you stop guessing and start
targeting the right things, you're not
just tweaking your resume, you're giving
yourself a real shot at landing
interviews for the jobs that you
actually want. Watch this next because
it builds on everything that we just
covered.
