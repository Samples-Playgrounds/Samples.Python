# Tokenizers

*   language models

    *   process text using tokens, which are common sequences of characters found in a set of text

    *   models learn to understand the statistical relationships between these tokens
    
    *   producing the next token in a sequence of tokens.

*   token 

    *   generally corresponds to ~4 characters of text for common English text. 
    
    *   translates to roughly ¾ of a word (so 100 tokens ~= 75 words).

*   programmatic interface for tokenizing text

    *   tiktoken package for Python
